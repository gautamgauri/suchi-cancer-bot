## What cancer is
Cancer is uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Sometimes it forms a lump (tumour) and in some cases can spread.

## Next steps
- Persistent symptoms (2–3+ weeks) merit an in-person evaluation.
- Severe symptoms (breathing difficulty, heavy bleeding, fainting) require urgent care.

## Questions to ask a doctor
- What are the likely causes?
- What tests are recommended next, and why?
