See [Advances in Kidney Cancer Research](/types/kidney/research) for an overview of recent findings and progress, plus ongoing projects supported by NCI.

- [Are New Immune-Based Treatments for Kidney and Pancreatic Cancer on the Horizon?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2025/neoantigen-vaccine-pancreatic-kidney-cancer)

Posted: April 23, 2025

In small trials, personalized treatment vaccines appeared to prevent cancer from returning in patients who had successful surgery to remove their tumors. The treatments, which were created based on intensive analyses of patients’ tumors, appeared to be safe.
- [Tumor Signatures May Help Explain Global Differences in Kidney Cancer Rates](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/kidney-cancer-mutational-signatures-geographic-variation)

Posted: July 1, 2024

By analyzing patterns of DNA mutations in kidney cancers from people around the world, researchers have discovered new clues about possible causes of the disease. Identifying these mutational signatures might lead to strategies for preventing kidney cancer.
- [Pembrolizumab Is First Adjuvant Therapy to Improve Overall Survival in Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/kidney-cancer-pembrolizumab-increases-survival)

Posted: May 21, 2024

In a large clinical trial, treatment with pembrolizumab after surgery helped people with kidney cancer live longer than those who got a placebo and standard monitoring. The findings mark the first time an adjuvant treatment for kidney cancer has improved survival.
- [Analysis identifies 50 new genomic regions associated with kidney cancer risk](/news-events/press-releases/2024/genomic-analysis-kidney-cancer-risk)

Posted: April 26, 2024

An international team of researchers has identified 50 new areas across the genome that are associated with the risk of developing kidney cancer. The analysis identified genetic variants associated with the risk of developing papillary renal cell carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
- [Nivolumab Injections Could Make Treatment Easier for More People with Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/kidney-cancer-subcutaneous-nivolumab)

Posted: March 13, 2024

In a clinical trial, an injectable form of nivolumab (Opdivo) was as effective against kidney cancer as the intravenous form of the drug. Side effects were also similar and treatment time was shorter. Injectable immunotherapies, several experts said, if found to be comparable to IV forms, can be more convenient to receive and accessible to more people.
- [SBRT Emerging as an Important Treatment for Early-Stage Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/kidney-cancer-localized-sbrt-radiation)

Posted: October 24, 2023

Stereotactic body radiotherapy was effective in people with localized kidney cancer who weren’t able to have surgery to remove their tumor, a clinical trial has shown. No patients had their cancer start growing or died from cancer over the next 5 years.
- [Belzutifan Approved to Treat Tumors Linked to Inherited Disorder VHL](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/fda-belzutifan-vhl-tumors)

Posted: September 21, 2021

FDA has approved belzutifan (Welireg) to treat adults with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) who have tumors of the kidney, brain, nervous system, or pancreas. The drug may help these patients avoid or delay surgery by shrinking their tumors.
- [Targeted Therapy Cabozantinib Slows Progression of Rare Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/papillary-renal-cell-carcinoma-cabozantinib)

Posted: March 24, 2021

Cabozantinib (Cabometyx) is an effective initial treatment for people with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), a rare type of kidney cancer. A clinical trial showed the drug was more effective than the current standard treatment.
- [Liquid Biopsy Detects Brain Cancer and Early-Stage Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/liquid-biopsy-kidney-brain-cancer)

Posted: July 23, 2020

Results from two studies show that a liquid biopsy that analyzes DNA in blood accurately detected kidney cancer at early and more advanced stages and identified and classified different types of brain tumors.
- [Targeted Therapy–Immunotherapy Combinations Effective for Advanced Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/kidney-cancer-immunotherapy-targeted-therapy-combination)

Posted: March 19, 2019

In two clinical trials, combination treatments that included an immune checkpoint inhibitor and axitinib (Inlyta) led to better outcomes for patients with advanced kidney cancer than treatment with sunitinib (Sutent), the standard initial therapy.
- [Some Children with Wilms Tumor Can Receive Less Therapy, Study Suggests](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/wilms-tumor-skip-radiation-therapy)

Posted: May 23, 2018

Results from an NCI-sponsored clinical trial may point to an important change in how some children with advanced Wilms tumor, a form of kidney cancer, are treated.
- [FDA Approves Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Combination for Advanced Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/kidney-cancer-fda-nivolumab-ipilimumab-first-line)

Posted: May 10, 2018

FDA has approved the combination of two immunotherapy drugs, nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy), as an initial treatment for some patients with advanced kidney cancer. Learn how this approval will affect patient care.
- [Cabozantinib Approval Expands Initial Treatment Options for Advanced Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/cabozantinib-fda-first-line-kidney)

Posted: February 27, 2018

The Food and Drug Administration has approved cabozantinib (Cabometyx®) as an initial treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, the most common type of kidney cancer.
- [Studies Highlight Potential of Targeting HIF-2 in Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/hif2-kidney-cancer)

Posted: September 29, 2016

Two new studies suggest that a new class of drugs can effectively target a molecular driver of the most common type of kidney cancer.
- [Two New Therapies Approved by FDA for Advanced Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/fda-cabozantinib-lenvatinib-kidney)

Posted: June 3, 2016

The FDA has approved two drugs, cabozantinib and lenvatinib, for patients whose advanced kidney cancers have progressed after prior treatment with antiangiogenic therapies.
- [Sunitinib and Sorafenib Ineffective as Adjuvant Therapies for Kidney Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/adjuvant-angiogenesis-kidney)

Posted: April 8, 2016

Results from a recent clinical trial show that post-surgical therapy with two anti-angiogenesis drugs does not improve progression-free survival for patients with kidney cancer and may cause serious side effects.
- [TCGA findings on papillary renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer](/news-events/press-releases/2015/tcga-prcc-prostate-cancer)

Posted: November 5, 2015
