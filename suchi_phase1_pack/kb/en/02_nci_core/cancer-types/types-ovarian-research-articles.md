- [What’s at the Root of Ovarian Cancer? New Study May Have Found Part of the Answer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2025/ovarian-cancer-stic-high-risk-mscs)

Posted: April 24, 2025

A subgroup of mesenchymal stem cells, called high-risk MSCs, appears to fuel the formation of cancerous lesions in the fallopian tubes and the lesions’ transition to ovarian cancer, a study has found.
- [Approval of Elahere Expands Treatment Options for Some Advanced Ovarian Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-elahere-platinum-resistant-ovarian-cancer)

Posted: April 24, 2024

FDA approved mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (Elahere) to treat people with advanced, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors overproduce a protein called FR-α. The full approval was based on the results of a large, randomized trial called MIRASOL, which showed Elahere improved survival for these people.
- [Implanted “Drug Factories” Deliver Cancer Treatment Directly to Tumors](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/implanted-drug-factories-il2-ovarian-cancer)

Posted: April 7, 2022

Researchers have developed tiny “drug factories” that produce an immune-boosting molecule and can be implanted near tumors. The pinhead-sized beads eliminated tumors in mice with ovarian and colorectal cancer and will soon be tested in human studies.
- [Trametinib Is a New Treatment Option for Rare Form of Ovarian Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/trametinib-low-grade-serous-ovarian-cancer)

Posted: March 10, 2022

New results from a large study show that trametinib (Mekinist) is an effective treatment for low-grade serous ovarian cancer. The findings are the first strong evidence that this rare type of ovarian cancer should be treated differently from other forms of the disease.
- [When Ovarian Cancer Returns, Surgery May Be a Good Choice for Selected Patients](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/ovarian-cancer-return-surgery-desktop-iii)

Posted: January 12, 2022

For patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who meet strict criteria, additional surgery may improve survival, results from a large clinical trial show.
- [How Does Ovarian Cancer Form? A New Study Points to MicroRNA](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/ovarian-cancer-form-microrna)

Posted: July 30, 2020

A microRNA—a molecule made by cells to turn genes on and off—called miR-181a may help high-grade serous ovarian cancer form, a study has found. The scientists think the microRNA could potentially help doctors detect ovarian cancer earlier.
- [Ovarian Cancer Studies Aim to Reduce Racial Disparities, Improve Outcomes](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/ovarian-cancer-racial-disparities-studies)

Posted: July 16, 2020

Three recently launched NCI-supported studies could help researchers better understand the causes of racial/ethnic disparities in ovarian cancer. The ultimate goal is to eliminate disparities and improve survival for all women with the disease.
- [Surgery for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Does Not Improve Survival](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/ovarian-cancer-surgery-recurrent-survival)

Posted: December 10, 2019

Secondary surgery for women with recurrent ovarian cancer does not improve how long those women live, findings from a large trial show. The results call into question the current standard of practice for these patients.
- [PARP Inhibitors Show Promise as Initial Treatment for Ovarian Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/parp-inhibitors-ovarian-cancer-initial-treatment)

Posted: October 29, 2019

In three large clinical trials of women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, treatment with a PARP inhibitor as first-line therapy, maintenance therapy, or both, extended the length of time before participants’ cancers came back or got worse.
- [Fewer Women with Ovarian, Breast Cancer Undergo Genetic Testing than Expected](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/ovarian-breast-cancer-testing-inherited-genetic-mutations)

Posted: April 9, 2019

Many women diagnosed with ovarian and breast cancer are not undergoing tests for inherited genetic mutations that can provide important information to help guide decisions about treatment and longer-term cancer screening, a new study has found.
- [Trial Examines Value of Lymph Node Surgery in Advanced Ovarian Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/lymphadenectomy-advanced-ovarian-cancer-survival)

Posted: March 27, 2019

Surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in the area around an advanced ovarian tumor did not improve survival in a recent randomized clinical trial. The study also found systematic lymphadenectomy was associated with more frequent serious complications.
- [Olaparib after Initial Treatment Delays Ovarian Cancer Progression](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/ovarian-cancer-olaparib-maintenance-therapy)

Posted: November 20, 2018

In a recent trial, the PARP inhibitor olaparib substantially delayed ovarian cancer from coming back after the first line of chemotherapy. Could the findings change the standard of care for newly diagnosed ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation?
- [Rucaparib Approved as Maintenance Treatment for Some Recurrent Ovarian Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/rucaparib-fda-ovarian-cancer-maintenance-therapy)

Posted: May 4, 2018

FDA has expanded its approval of rucaparib (Rubraca) as a maintenance therapy for women with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer whose tumors shrank after subsequent treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy.
- [Study Shows Experimental Screening Test Can Detect Endometrial and Ovarian Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/liquid-biopsy-screening-test-endometrial-ovarian)

Posted: May 2, 2018

Scientists have struggled to come up with a simple test to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers early, when they are most likely to respond to treatment. Can a liquid biopsy test called PapSEEK change that?
- [Experimental Ovarian Cancer Vaccine Shows Promise in Mice](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/ovarian-cancer-vaccine)

Posted: November 17, 2017

The experimental vaccine targets a protein found at elevated levels in about 90% of the most common type of ovarian cancer. If validated in human studies, researchers believe the vaccine may be particularly useful for women who carry BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.
- [Many Ovarian Cancers May Start in Fallopian Tubes, Study Finds](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/ovarian-cancer-fallopian-tube-origins)

Posted: November 15, 2017

A new study provides more evidence that the most common form of ovarian cancer may originate in the fallopian tubes, and that there is a window of nearly 7 years between development of fallopian tube lesions and the start of ovarian cancer.
- [Levels of Immune Cells within Ovarian Tumors Linked to Survival for Some Patients](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/ovarian-cancer-tils-survival)

Posted: November 6, 2017

A large international study suggests that the presence of certain immune cells within the tumors of some patients with ovarian cancer are associated with improved survival.
