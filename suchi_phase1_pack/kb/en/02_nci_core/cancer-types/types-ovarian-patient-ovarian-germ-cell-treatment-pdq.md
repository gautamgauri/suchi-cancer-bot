- Ovarian germ cell tumor is a disease in which malignant
(cancer) cells form in the germ (egg) cells of the ovary.
- Signs of ovarian germ cell tumor are swelling of the
abdomen or vaginal bleeding after menopause.
- Tests that examine the ovaries, pelvic area, blood, and ovarian
tissue are used to diagnose ovarian germ cell tumor.
- Certain factors affect prognosis
(chance of recovery) and treatment options.

### Ovarian germ cell tumor is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the germ (egg) cells of the ovary.

[Germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) begin
in the [reproductive cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46563&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (egg or
[sperm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) of the body. [Ovarian germ
cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446560&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually occur in teenage girls or young women and most often affect
just one [ovary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are a pair of [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the female
[reproductive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They are
in the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), one on each
side of the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the hollow,
pear-shaped organ where a [fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries
make eggs and female [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609921.jpg)![Anatomy of the female reproductive system; drawing shows the uterus, myometrium (muscular outer layer of the uterus), endometrium (inner lining of the uterus), ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609921-750.jpg "Anatomy of the female reproductive system; drawing shows the uterus, myometrium (muscular outer layer of the uterus), endometrium (inner lining of the uterus), ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina.")

Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.

Ovarian germ cell tumor is a general name that is used to describe
several different types of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The
most common ovarian germ cell tumor is called [dysgerminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=672835&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). See the following [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)

### Signs of ovarian germ cell tumor are swelling of the abdomen or vaginal bleeding after menopause.

Ovarian germ cell tumors can be hard to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (find) early.
Often there are no [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the
early [stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but
tumors may be found during regular
[gynecologic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45056&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exams (checkups). Check with your doctor if you have:

- Swollen
[abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without weight gain in other
parts of the body.
- Bleeding from the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (when you are no longer having
[menstrual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46297&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) periods).

### Tests that examine the ovaries, pelvic area, blood, and ovarian tissue are used to diagnose ovarian germ cell tumor.

In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **[Pelvic exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the vagina, [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), uterus, [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), ovaries, and [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [speculum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or [nurse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A [Pap test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45978&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two [lubricated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924.jpg)![Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam. The uterus, left fallopian tube, left ovary, cervix, vagina, bladder, and rectum are shown. Two gloved fingers of one hand of the doctor or nurse are shown inserted into the vagina, while the other hand is shown pressing on the lower abdomen. The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924-750.jpg "Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam. The uterus, left fallopian tube, left ovary, cervix, vagina, bladder, and rectum are shown. Two gloved fingers of one hand of the doctor or nurse are shown inserted into the vagina, while the other hand is shown pressing on the lower abdomen. The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.")

Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.
- **[Laparotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) procedure in which an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cut) is made in the wall of the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are removed or [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) samples are taken and checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs of disease.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**:
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[Serum tumor marker test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a sample of [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An increased level of [alpha fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AFP) or [human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HCG) in the blood may be a sign of ovarian germ cell tumor.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on:

- The type
of cancer.
- The size of the tumor.
- The stage of cancer (whether it affects part
of the ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the
body).
- The way the cancer cells look under a microscope.
- The patient’s
general health.

Ovarian germ cell tumors are usually [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) if found and
treated early.

## Stages of Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors

### Key Points

- After ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests
are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other
parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- The following stages are used for ovarian germ cell
tumors:
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- Ovarian germ cell tumor can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out whether [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the
[ovary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body
is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the
staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. Unless a doctor is sure the cancer has spread from the ovaries to other parts
of the body, an
operation called a [laparotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is done to see if the cancer has spread. The
doctor must cut into the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and
carefully look at all the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to see if they have cancer in them. The doctor will
cut out small pieces of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) so they can be checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer. The doctor may also wash the
[abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is also checked under a microscope to see if it has cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in it.
Usually, the doctor will remove the cancer and other organs that have cancer in them
during the laparotomy. It is important
to know the stage in
order to plan treatment.

Many of the tests used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [ovarian germ cell tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446560&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are also used for staging.
The following tests and procedures may also be used for staging:

- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (positron emission tomography scan)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[Transvaginal ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46633&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam**: A procedure used to examine the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An [ultrasound transducer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367430&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if an ovarian germ cell tumor spreads to the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the tumor cells in the liver are actually cancerous ovarian germ cells. The disease is metastatic ovarian germ cell tumor, not liver cancer.

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### The following stages are used for ovarian germ cell tumors:

#### Stage I

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618025.jpg)![Three-panel drawing of stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC; each panel shows the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. The first panel (stage IA) shows cancer inside one ovary. The second panel (stage IB) shows cancer inside both ovaries.

The third panel (stage IC) shows cancer inside both ovaries and (a) the tumor in the ovary on the left has ruptured (broken open), (b) there is cancer on the surface of the ovary on the right, and (c) there are cancer cells in the pelvic peritoneal fluid (inset).")

In stage IA, cancer is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube. In stage IB, cancer is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes. In stage IC, cancer is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true: (a) either the tumor or the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open), or (b) cancer is also found on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube, or (c) cancer cells are found in the pelvic peritoneal fluid.

In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=438722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found in one or both [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage
IB, and stage IC.

- Stage IA: Cancer is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.
- Stage IB: Cancer is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.
- Stage IC: Cancer is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true:

- the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ruptured (broke open) during [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or
- the [capsule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (outer covering) of the ovary ruptured before surgery, or there is cancer on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube; or
- cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [peritoneal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that contains
most of the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) or in [washings](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=700145&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lining the peritoneal
cavity).

#### Stage II

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618027.jpg)![Three-panel drawing of stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage II primary peritoneal cancer; the first panel (stage IIA) shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to the fallopian tube and uterus. Also shown are the cervix and vagina. The second panel (stage IIB) shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to the colon. The third panel (primary peritoneal cancer) shows cancer in the pelvic peritoneum.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618027-750.jpg "Three-panel drawing of stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage II primary peritoneal cancer; the first panel (stage IIA) shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to the fallopian tube and uterus. Also shown are the cervix and vagina. The second panel (stage IIB) shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to the colon. The third panel (primary peritoneal cancer) shows cancer in the pelvic peritoneum.")

In stage IIA, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread to the uterus and/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries. In stage IIB, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread to organs in the peritoneal cavity, such as the colon. In primary peritoneal cancer, cancer is found in the pelvic peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body.

In [stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=438723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found in one or both [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and has spread into other areas of the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [primary peritoneal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found within the pelvis. Stage II is divided into
stage IIA and stage IIB.

- Stage IIA: Cancer has spread from where it first formed to the
[uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or
the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.
- Stage IIB: Cancer has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [peritoneal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that contains most of the organs in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

Also shown is a 10-cm ruler and a 4-inch ruler.")

Tumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).

#### Stage III

In [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=438724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
is found in one or both [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or is [primary peritoneal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and has spread outside the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or to nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage
IIIB, and stage IIIC.

- In stage IIIA, one of the following is true:

- Cancer has spread to lymph nodes behind the [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only; or
- Cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that can be seen only with a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the [omentum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a fold of the peritoneum that surrounds the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the abdomen). Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618030.jpg)![Drawing of stage IIIA shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to (a) lymph nodes behind the peritoneum and (b) the omentum. The small intestine, colon, fallopian tubes, uterus, and bladder are also shown.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618030-750.jpg "Drawing of stage IIIA shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to (a) lymph nodes behind the peritoneum and (b) the omentum. The small intestine, colon, fallopian tubes, uterus, and bladder are also shown.")

In stage IIIA, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and (a) cancer has spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum only, or (b) cancer cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum. Cancer may have also spread to nearby lymph nodes.

- Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/655351.jpg)![Drawing of stage IIIB shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to the omentum. The cancer in the omentum is 2 centimeters or smaller. An inset shows 2 centimeters is about the size of a peanut.

In stage IIIB, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum. The cancer in the omentum is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer may have also spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.
- Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum, and the cancer in the peritoneum is
larger than 2 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/655353.jpg)![Drawing of stage IIIC shows cancer inside both ovaries that has spread to the omentum.

The cancer in the omentum is larger than 2 centimeters. An inset shows 2 centimeters is about the size of a peanut. Also shown are the small intestine, colon, fallopian tubes, uterus, bladder, and lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.")

In stage IIIC, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, such as the omentum. The cancer in the omentum is larger than 2 centimeters. Cancer may have also spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the liver or spleen (not shown).

#### Stage IV

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/657667.jpg)![Drawing of stage IV shows other parts of the body where ovarian cancer may spread, including the lung, liver, and lymph nodes in the groin. An inset on the top shows extra fluid around the lung. An inset on the bottom shows cancer cells spreading through the blood and lymph system to another part of the body where metastatic cancer has formed.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/657667-750.jpg "Drawing of stage IV shows other parts of the body where ovarian cancer may spread, including the lung, liver, and lymph nodes in the groin. An inset on the top shows extra fluid around the lung. An inset on the bottom shows cancer cells spreading through the blood and lymph system to another part of the body where metastatic cancer has formed.")

In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body. In stage IVA, cancer cells are found in extra fluid that builds up around the lungs. In stage IVB, cancer has spread to organs and tissues outside the abdomen, including the lung, liver, and lymph nodes in the groin.

In [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=438725&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread beyond the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.

- Stage IVA: Cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in extra [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that builds up around the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) outside the abdomen, including [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [groin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46375&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Ovarian germ cell tumor can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back in the other
[ovary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or in other parts of the body.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell tumors.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with [ovarian germ cell tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446560&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some
are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help
improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the most common
treatment of ovarian germ cell tumor. A doctor may take out the
cancer using one of the following
types of surgery.

- [Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322894&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure to remove one [ovary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and one [fallopian tube](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Total hysterectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure to remove the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including the [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the operation is called a [vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cut) in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the operation is called a total [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a [laparoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44360&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/612116.jpg)![Hysterectomy; drawing shows the female reproductive anatomy, including the ovaries, uterus, vagina, fallopian tubes, and cervix. Dotted lines show which organs and tissues are removed in a total hysterectomy, a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, and a radical hysterectomy. An inset shows the location of two possible incisions on the abdomen: a low transverse incision is just above the pubic area and a vertical incision is between the navel and the pubic area.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/612116-750.jpg "Hysterectomy; drawing shows the female reproductive anatomy, including the ovaries, uterus, vagina, fallopian tubes, and cervix. Dotted lines show which organs and tissues are removed in a total hysterectomy, a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, and a radical hysterectomy. An inset shows the location of two possible incisions on the abdomen: a low transverse incision is just above the pubic area and a vertical incision is between the navel and the pubic area.")

Hysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.
- [Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322852&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.
- [Tumor debulking](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46635&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):
A surgical procedure in which as much of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as possible is removed. Some tumors cannot be completely removed.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy
after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the
surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

After [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for an ovarian germ cell tumor, a [second-look](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45875&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [laparotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done. This is similar to the laparotomy that is done to find out the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer. Second-look laparotomy is a surgical procedure to find out if tumor [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are left after [primary treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=589417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). During this procedure, the doctor will take samples of [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the abdomen to see if any cancer is left. This procedure is not done for [dysgerminomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=672835&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Observation

[Observation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45981&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is closely watching a patient’s [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment unless [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) appear or change.

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Combination chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ovarian "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ovarian").

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

#### High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant

[High-dose chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [bone marrow
transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45263&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a method of giving very high [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of chemotherapy and replacing [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient or a [donor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body’s blood cells.

#### New treatment options

[Combination
chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the use of more than one anticancer drug) is being tested in clinical trials.

### Treatment for ovarian germ cell tumors may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## Treatment of Stage I Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors

For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/ovarian/patient/ovarian-germ-cell-treatment-pdq#_154) section.

Treatment depends on whether the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [dysgerminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=672835&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or another type of
[ovarian germ cell tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446560&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of dysgerminoma may include:

- [Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322894&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with or
without [lymphangiography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46307&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or
[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by
[observation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45981&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by
[radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by
[chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of other ovarian germ cell tumors may include:

- unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by careful
observation; or
- unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sometimes followed by
[combination chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Use our [clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of ovarian germ cell tumors. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
