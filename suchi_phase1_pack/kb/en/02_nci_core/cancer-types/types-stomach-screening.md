# Screening for Stomach Cancer - NCI

# Stomach Cancer Screening

Screening is looking for cancer before a person has any [symptoms](/types/stomach/symptoms). This can help detect cancer at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045885&version=Patient&language=en). When [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044636&version=Patient&language=en) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046683&version=Patient&language=en) or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat.

In the United States, there are no standard or routine screening tests to detect [stomach cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000445087&version=Patient&language=en) in people at average risk. Researchers are working to develop such tests. If a test reduces the number of deaths from stomach cancer, it may become a standard screening test.

## Tests to screen for stomach cancer

Some people who have a higher risk of stomach cancer may benefit from screening with upper endoscopy, including:

- older people with chronic [gastric atrophy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046398&version=Patient&language=en) or [pernicious anemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046235&version=Patient&language=en)
- people who have had
- partial [gastrectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046397&version=Patient&language=en)
- a family history of stomach cancer
- people who have certain [genetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046391&version=Patient&language=en) syndromes
- people from countries where stomach cancer is more common

### Upper endoscopy

Upper endoscopy is a procedure to look inside the [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046408&version=Patient&language=en), stomach, and duodenum (first part of the [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046582&version=Patient&language=en)) to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is passed through the mouth and down the throat into the esophagus. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue, which is checked under a microscope for signs of disease.

## Risks of stomach cancer screening

Talk with your doctor about whether stomach cancer screening is right for you.

Potential risks of stomach cancer screening include:

- **False-negative test results.** Screening test results may appear to be normal even though stomach cancer is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.
- **False-positive test results.** Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000430405&version=Patient&language=en) and is usually followed by more tests and procedures which also have risks.
- **Risks of the screening test itself.** Upper endoscopy may cause the following rare, but serious, complications:
- a small hole (puncture) in the esophagus or stomach
- heart problems
- breathing problems
- lung [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045364&version=Patient&language=en) from inhaling food, fluid, or stomach acid into the lung
- severe bleeding that needs to be treated at a hospital
- reactions to medicine used during the procedure
