### Laryngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the larynx.

The [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a part of the [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), between the base of the tongue and the [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The larynx contains the [vocal
cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which vibrate and make sound when air is directed against
them. The sound echoes through the [pharynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46061&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), mouth, and nose to make a person's
voice.

There are three main parts of the larynx:

- [Supraglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46610&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The
upper part of the larynx above the vocal cords, including the
[epiglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46421&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Glottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46380&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The
middle part of the larynx where the vocal cords are located.
- [Subglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46607&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The
lower part of the larynx between the vocal cords and the [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (windpipe).

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/786385.jpg)![Drawing shows areas where laryngeal cancer may form or spread, including the supraglottis, glottis (vocal cords), subglottis, thyroid, trachea, and esophagus. Also shown are the epiglottis, the upper part of the spinal column, the carotid artery, the cartilage around the thyroid and trachea, lymph nodes in the neck, and the chest.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/786385-750.jpg "Drawing shows areas where laryngeal cancer may form or spread, including the supraglottis, glottis (vocal cords), subglottis, thyroid, trachea, and esophagus. Also shown are the epiglottis, the upper part of the spinal column, the carotid artery, the cartilage around the thyroid and trachea, lymph nodes in the neck, and the chest.")

Laryngeal cancer forms in the tissues of the larynx (area of the throat that contains the vocal cords). The larynx includes the supraglottis, glottis (vocal cords), and subglottis. The cancer may spread to nearby tissues or to the thyroid, trachea, or esophagus. It may also spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, the carotid artery, the upper part of the spinal column, the chest, and to other parts of the body (not shown).

Most [laryngeal cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445040&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) form in [squamous cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46056&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the thin, flat [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lining the inside of the larynx.

Laryngeal cancer is a type of [head and neck cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer.

Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called
a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop laryngeal cancer, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.

### Signs and symptoms of laryngeal cancer include a sore throat and ear pain.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by laryngeal cancer or by
other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:

- A sore throat or cough that does not go away.
- Trouble or pain when swallowing.
- Ear pain.
- A lump in the neck or throat.
- A change or hoarseness in the voice.

### Tests that examine the throat and neck are used to help diagnose and stage laryngeal cancer.

In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **[Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the throat and neck**: An exam to check the throat and neck for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas. The doctor will feel the inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the mouth and throat with a small
long-handled mirror and light. This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the [gums](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=481753&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); the back, roof, and floor of the mouth; the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue; and the throat. The neck will be felt for swollen [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689078&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and medical treatments will also be taken.
- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cells or [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) so they can be viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for signs of cancer. The sample of tissue may be removed during one of the following procedures:

- **[Laryngoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46321&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which the doctor checks the larynx (voice box) with a mirror or a [laryngoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46320&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for abnormal areas.
A laryngoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing the inside of the throat and voice box. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
- **[Endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A
procedure to look at [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and tissues inside the body, such as the throat, [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and trachea to check for abnormal areas. An [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a thin, lighted tube with a light and a lens for viewing) is inserted through an opening in the body, such as the mouth. A special tool on the endoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT
scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/753850.jpg)![Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/753850-750.jpg "Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.")

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (positron emission tomography scan)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
- **[PET-CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=742485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):** A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself. A PET-CT scan may be used to help diagnose disease, such as cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
- **[Bone scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.
- **[Barium swallow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A series of x-rays of the esophagus and [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The patient drinks a liquid that contains [barium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46514&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a silver-white [metallic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The liquid coats the esophagus and stomach, and x-rays are taken. This procedure is also called an upper GI series.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

[Prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depends on the following:

- The [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease.
- The location and size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- The [grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45702&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the tumor.
- The patient's age, sex, and general health, including whether the patient is [anemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45360&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment options depend on the following:

- The stage of the disease.
- The location and size of the tumor.
- Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.
- Whether the cancer has come back ([recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

Smoking tobacco and drinking [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) decrease the effectiveness of
treatment for laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer who continue to smoke and drink are less likely to be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and more likely to develop a second tumor. After treatment for laryngeal cancer,
frequent and careful [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is important.

## Stages of Laryngeal Cancer

### Key Points

- After laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the
body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:
- Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- After surgery, the stage of the cancer may change and more treatment may be needed.
- Laryngeal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the
[larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body
is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information
gathered from the staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know the
stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the [tests](/types/head-and-neck/patient/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_18) used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [laryngeal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445040&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are often also used to stage the disease.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if laryngeal cancer spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually laryngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic laryngeal cancer, not lung cancer.

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:

#### Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)

In [stage 0](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=396799&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the lining of the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
These abnormal cells may become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread into nearby normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage 0 is also called [carcinoma in
situ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Stage I

In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45281&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed in the [supraglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46610&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [glottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46380&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [subglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46607&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) area of the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Supraglottis:
Cancer is in one area of the supraglottis and the
[vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) work
normally.
- Glottis: Cancer
is in one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords work normally.
- Subglottis:
Cancer is in the subglottis only.

#### Stage II

In [stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45282&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed in the [supraglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46610&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [glottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46380&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [subglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46607&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) area of the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Supraglottis: Cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or has spread to the area at the base of the tongue or to [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the [vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The vocal cords work normally.
- Glottis: Cancer has spread to the supraglottis, subglottis, or both, and/or the vocal cords do not work normally.
- Subglottis: Cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords may not work normally.

#### Stage III

In [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45283&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed in the [supraglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46610&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [glottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46380&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [subglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46607&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) area of the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415526.jpg)![Drawing shows different sizes of a tumor in centimeters (cm) compared to the size of a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm). Also shown is a 10-cm ruler and a 4-inch ruler.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415526-750.jpg "Drawing shows different sizes of a tumor in centimeters (cm) compared to the size of a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm). Also shown is a 10-cm ruler and a 4-inch ruler.")

Tumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).

In stage III cancer of the supraglottis:

- cancer is in the larynx only and the [vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) do not work, and/or cancer has spread near or through the inner part of the [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer may have also spread to one [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the same side of the neck as the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the lymph node is 3 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or smaller; or
- cancer is in one area of the supraglottis and the vocal cords work normally. Cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or
- cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or has spread to the area at the base of the tongue or to [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the vocal cords. The vocal cords work normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.

In stage III cancer of the glottis:

- cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords do not work, and/or cancer has spread near or through the inner part of the thyroid cartilage. Cancer may have also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or
- cancer is in one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords work normally. Cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or
- cancer has spread to the supraglottis, subglottis, or both, and/or the vocal cords do not work normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.

In stage III cancer of the subglottis:

- cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords do not work, and/or cancer has spread near or through the inner part of the thyroid cartilage. Cancer may have also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or
- cancer is in the subglottis only. Cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or
- cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords may not work normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.

#### Stage IV

Stage IV is divided
into [stage IVA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428383&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [stage IVB](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428385&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [stage IVC](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Each substage is the same for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [supraglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46610&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [glottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46380&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [subglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46607&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- In stage IVA:

- Cancer has spread through the [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or has spread to [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) beyond the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as the neck, [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), thyroid, or [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer may have also spread to one [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the same side of the neck as the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the lymph node is 3 [centimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or smaller; or
- Cancer may have spread from the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis to tissues beyond the larynx, such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. The [vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may not work normally. Cancer has spread:

- to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has spread through the outside covering of the lymph node; or
- to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer has not spread through the outside covering of the lymph node; or
- to more than one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer has not spread through the outside covering of the lymph nodes; or
- to lymph nodes on both sides of the neck or on the side of the neck opposite the primary tumor and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer has not spread through the outside covering of the lymph nodes.
- In stage IVB:

- Cancer may have spread from the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis to the space in front of the [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the area around the [carotid artery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=396786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or the area between the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The vocal cords may not work normally. Cancer has spread:

- to one lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer has not spread through the outside covering of the lymph node; or
- to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the primary tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters. Cancer has spread through the outside covering of the lymph node; or
- to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck. Cancer has spread through the outside covering of the lymph nodes; or
- to one lymph node of any size on the side of the neck opposite the primary tumor. Cancer has spread through the outside covering of the lymph node;

***or***
- Cancer has spread from the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis to the space in front of the spine, the area around the carotid artery, or the area between the lungs. Cancer may have also spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck and the lymph nodes may be any size.
- In stage IVC, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or bone.

### After surgery, the stage of the cancer may change and more treatment may be needed.

If the cancer is removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) will examine a sample of the cancer [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes, the pathologist’s review will result in a change to the stage of the cancer and more treatment after surgery.

### Laryngeal cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back in the
[larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or in other parts of the
body, such as lungs, liver, or bone. It is most likely to come back in the first 2 to 3 years.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with laryngeal cancer.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with
[laryngeal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445040&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently
used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment
clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or
obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical
trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Radiation therapy

[Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/732667.jpg)![External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table under a machine that is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. An inset shows a mesh mask that helps keep the patient's head and neck from moving during treatment. The mask has pieces of white tape with small ink marks on it. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/732667-750.jpg "External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table under a machine that is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. An inset shows a mesh mask that helps keep the patient's head and neck from moving during treatment. The mask has pieces of white tape with small ink marks on it. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.")

External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck. A machine is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. The machine can rotate around the patient, delivering radiation from many different angles to provide highly conformal treatment. A mesh mask helps keep the patient’s head and neck from moving during treatment. Small ink marks are put on the mask. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.

Radiation therapy may work better in patients who have
stopped smoking before beginning treatment. External radiation therapy to the
[thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the
[pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may change the way
the thyroid gland works. A [blood test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check the [thyroid hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44558&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level in the body may be done before
and after [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to make sure the thyroid gland is working properly.

[Hyperfractionated radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=484407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to treat laryngeal cancer. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day.
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy. New types of radiation therapy are being studied in the treatment of laryngeal cancer.

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common
treatment for all stages of
laryngeal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:

- [Cordectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46489&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the
[vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only.
- [Supraglottic laryngectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257528&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the
[supraglottis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46610&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only.
- [Hemilaryngectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257520&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove half of the
[larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (voice box). A
hemilaryngectomy saves the voice.
- [Partial laryngectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove part of the
larynx (voice box). A
partial laryngectomy helps keep the patient's ability to talk.
- [Total laryngectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257529&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the whole larynx.
During this operation, a hole is made in the front of the neck to allow the
patient to breathe. This is called a [tracheostomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46625&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Thyroidectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44557&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The removal of all or part of the thyroid
gland.
- [Laser surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure that uses a [laser beam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45748&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to remove a surface [lesion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the larynx.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
time of the surgery, some patients may be given [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or radiation
therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given
after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
[adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/head-neck "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/head-neck"). Laryngeal cancer is a type of [head and neck cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Immunotherapy

[Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of [biologic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45617&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- [PD-1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=777027&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [PD-L1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797389&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) inhibitor [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): PD-1 is a [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the surface of [T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that helps keep the body’s [immune responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in check. PD-L1 is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells. [Nivolumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=767747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [pembrolizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=764538&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are types of PD-1 inhibitors used to treat [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [recurrent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) laryngeal cancer.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/774646.jpg)![Immune checkpoint inhibitor; the panel on the left shows the binding of proteins PD-L1 (on the tumor cell) to PD-1 (on the T cell), which keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).

Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

#### Targeted therapy

[Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.

- [Monoclonal antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They may be used alone or to carry drugs, [toxins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) material directly to cancer cells. [Cetuximab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45467&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is being studied in the treatment of laryngeal cancer.

How do monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.

#### Radiosensitizers

[Radiosensitizers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46553&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.

### Treatment for laryngeal cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult laryngeal cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
