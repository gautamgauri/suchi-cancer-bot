Psychosocial support and counseling can help young people with cancer develop skills to manage the emotional side effects of cancer.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis and going through treatment can make you feel as if you’re on an emotional roller coaster. This is especially true for young adults. You may feel shocked, afraid, angry, sad, embarrassed, and lonely as you start treatment. Over the course of your illness you, like many young people, may also feel hopeful, determined, and optimistic. These are sometimes called the emotional or [psychosocial](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/648685) side effects of treatment.

Just as you talk with your treatment team about the physical [side effects](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46580) of cancer treatment, it’s important to talk about how you are feeling emotionally—so you can get the [psychosocial support](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/792696) that you need and deserve.

A growing number of hospitals, including many [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find), offer support programs designed for young people with cancer. These programs may include young adult [support groups](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45917), [fertility preservation](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/732564), [art therapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/657798), [music therapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/640061), and adventure-based programs.

Next steps after a cancer diagnosis

As a young person, you’re probably new to the health care system and may not have had to make major health decisions or navigate the health care system. Use the strategies listed below to gain a sense of control as you begin treatment.

**Learning about your cancer type and treatment options**
Learning as much as you can about the type of cancer you have, and your treatment options, will help you take an active role in your care. Some young people prefer to get information directly from their health care provider, whereas others like to read everything they can about their [cancer type](/types) and [treatment options](/about-cancer/treatment). It may help to think about the type of information-seeker and learner you are and to share your preferences with your health care team. Learn more about [how to find cancer information you can trust.](/about-cancer/managing-care/using-trusted-resources)

There’s a lot of information online and not all of it is relevant to your specific cancer diagnosis or to cancer in young adults. It’s important to seek out trustworthy websites and to confirm what you find is relevant with your health care team.

Based on your age and cancer type, you may be treated according to a [pediatric cancer treatment](/publications/pdq/information-summaries/pediatric-treatment)protocol or an [adult cancer treatment](/publications/pdq/information-summaries/adult-treatment) protocol.

**Advocating for yourself**
Learning to speak up, even if you are nervous, is an essential skill to gain during this cancer journey. Speak up about what is important to you, whether it be treatment preferences, questions about side effects, or ways to manage other issues that affect your life. While it may be challenging, especially in the beginning, speaking up will help you get the information you need to make important decisions.

You may also want to ask your medical team to recommend apps on your phone that can help you track key information such as appointments, medications, and side effects. Some people choose to use a note-taking app on their phone or bring a notebook to appointments—to jot down questions ahead of time and notes from the appointment.

**Asking questions**
It may help to think of the people on your treatment team as coaches or teachers—knowledgeable and supportive experts who are giving you the best possible care and advice. To get the most from your health care team, jot down your questions before a visit and list concerns in order of importance. During your appointment, repeat back key information and ask clarifying questions to make sure you’ve understood important information. Here are some [questions you may want to ask your doctor.](/about-cancer/coping/questions)

Some side effects faced by young people with cancer are different than for older people. For example, as a young person you may need to be proactive in asking about fertility preservation methods and coping with sexual side effects. Here are tips to help you manage these and other [cancer treatment side effects](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects). It may also help to ask your social worker or nurse about strategies to balance the demands of treatment with attending school, working, or caring for young children. Here are tips to help address these and other aspects of [daily life during cancer treatment](/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day).

**Getting support from AYA programs and patient navigators**
Adolescent and young adult programs as well as patient navigation programs are increasingly being offered at many hospitals and [cancer centers](/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find). Having access to a [patient navigator](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/791361) (also called a [patient advocate](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44534)) can be helpful, especially for young people.

Patient navigators can guide you through the health care system and help you through the various steps of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. They also help with practical matters, such as how to talk with your health care team, set up appointments, and identify appropriate financial, legal, and social support.

A growing number of [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers) and [organizations serving young adults with cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/aya#organizations-serving-adolescents-and-young-adults) have young adult patient navigators or can advise you on a remote patient navigator.

Support for young people during cancer treatment

Changes brought on by an illness such as cancer can be challenging, and at times feel overwhelming. Here are suggestions that have helped other young people:

**Keep relationships meaningful and strong**
When you’re used to sharing your day-to-day adventures and accomplishments with friends, thinking about how to share a cancer diagnosis, and the rigors of treatment, can put you at a loss for words. Relationships may feel different, awkward, or strained. Friends may be silent because they don’t know what to say or what you need. It can sometimes feel like your life is moving backwards, especially if you’ve taken a break from college, quit a job, or moved back home to receive cancer treatment. Although you may put up a brave front to protect family and friends, being open about what you are going through is a good place to start with people you care about most.

Friends usually want to help but might not know how to reach out. You may need to take the first step. Sites such as [CaringBridge](https://www.caringbridge.org/), [My Cancer Circle](https://mycancercircle.lotsahelpinghands.com/caregiving/home/), [MyLifeLine,](https://www.mylifeline.org/) and [Lotsa Helping Hands](https://lotsahelpinghands.com/) have tools that can help you and your family manage the challenge of sharing updates and asking for support.

**Find things that bring you joy**
When life is filled with change and uncertainty, it can help to think about the people and activities that are most important to you. Reflecting on who and what is most important can help you figure out ways to bring these things into your new normal. Doing so can help you stay grounded. Over time, you, like many other young people with cancer, may also choose to explore new interests or develop new skills. There are also programs at some cancer centers, and in your community, that offer art and music programs for patients.

**Connect with young adult patients and advocates**
It may help to connect with other young people who can relate to your experiences. Many organizations listed on the [Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer](/types/aya) page were started by young adult cancer survivors and/or their families. These organizations support adolescents and young adults affected by cancer through community building and other programs.

Books written by young adults with cancer, such as Planet Cancer and Everything Changes: The Insider’s Guide to Cancer in Your 20s and 30s may also be helpful. There’s also an annual conference called [CancerCon](https://stupidcancer.org/events/cancercon/) that connects hundreds of adolescents and young adults who have been affected by cancer.

**Stay as active as possible**
Being physically active during treatment may help you feel better. Exercising can strengthen muscles that may otherwise become weak during treatment. It can also help to prevent fatigue and lift your spirits. What you may be able to do physically will vary over the course of treatment, ranging from movement exercises to strenuous workouts. Meeting with a [physical therapist](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44707) can help you to choose exercises that are best for you.

At times, when it’s all you can do to manage your daily routine, you’ll want to get advice from a [social worker](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44730) or [occupational therapist](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/269446). And when you’re up for it, you may want to look at the physical activity and outdoor adventures section of the [Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer](/types/aya) page. Learn more about how others have [adjusted to cancer and treatment](/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer).

Making a mental health care plan to navigate your cancer journey

It is as important to take care of your mental health as it is your physical health. Your emotions will shift as you go through treatment. It’s common to experience periods of anxiety and difficulty adjusting, as well as times of hope and optimism. Here are suggestions that can help you navigate this cancer journey:

**Acknowledge your emotions**
Although it’s normal to feel down at times, signs of [depression](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-pdq) are more serious and often include no longer enjoying your favorite activities, changes to sleeping habits, feeling worthless, and/or having thoughts about suicide. If you have these feelings every day for several weeks, they may be signs of depression. Learn more about adjusting to cancer, including [feelings of anxiety and distress](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-pdq#_237). Learn about [emotions that are common in people with cancer](/about-cancer/coping/feelings).

**Meet with a mental health expert**
Talking with friends and family may help. However, fears related to treatment, coping with distress, and issues with relationships can be difficult to talk about. Mental health experts specialize in caring for young people with cancer and can provide strategies and relaxation techniques that are tailored to you.

Mental health experts include counselors, [psychologists](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44716), social workers, and [psychiatrists](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/454706). Learn about ways to [adjust to anxiety and distress](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-pdq) brought on by a cancer diagnosis or [cancer treatment](/about-cancer/treatment).

**Journal your journey**
Research has found that journaling can lower stress. Start small, a few minutes a day, and build up from there. There are different journaling strategies. Some people write down many thoughts and experiences. Others jot down a single thought or list a few things they are grateful for each day.

Young adult cancer survivors have written blogs such as the [Life Interrupted](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/author/suleika-jaouad) series and started organizations such as [Cactus Cancer Society](https://cactuscancer.org/)that offer creative writing workshops. Many hospitals also offer journaling programs.

**Find a support group**
While most hospitals offer [cancer support groups,](/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer/support-groups) a growing number of hospitals also have teen- and young adult–specific groups and programs. Online and in-person support programs are also offered by many of the organizations listed on the [Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer](/types/aya) page.

**Rely on your faith or belief system**
Focusing on your spiritual journey can help you to deal with hard times and existential questions. Coping with life and death issues as well as fear of recurrence can feel overwhelming. Focusing on your spiritual beliefs can offer powerful support and bring you strength. While not everyone identifies with a specific faith, some young people find that praying, meditating, or talking with a spiritual leader is helpful.

Many hospitals have spiritual care or chaplaincy department that offer spiritual care and support to the patients, their loved ones, and health care providers. Learn more about [spirituality in cancer care](/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-pdq).

**Crisis hotlines offer support**
There are nationally available hotlines that offer support to you and your family, such as The [National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI)’s hotline](https://www.nami.org/support-education/nami-helpline/) at: [1-800-950-NAMI (6264)](tel:+18009506264). The [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) is another service that you can call, text, or chat online with to get information to help you or someone you know.

About supportive care and whole person health

It’s important to treat the whole person, including your body, mind, and spirit—not just an organ or body part. Many hospitals have [whole person health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/whole-person-health-what-it-is-and-why-its-important) programs aimed at addressing not only physical health issues, but your emotional, social, and spiritual well-being.

Supportive care programs that focus on overall well-being may be part of [integrative medicine](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/689097) or [palliative care](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/269448) programs at the hospital where you are being treated. [Integrative medicine](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/689097) is care that combines [standard medical care](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/689630) (such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy) with [complementary medicine](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44951). Examples of complementary practices include: [acupuncture](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46724), [biofeedback](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44647), [cognitive behavioral therapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/650559), [deep breathing](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/809730), [guided imagery](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/689577), [mindfulness](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/377712) practices, and [yoga](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/532135). It’s an approach to care that is increasingly being used to address the many factors that can affect your well-being. Ask your nurse or social worker to suggest supportive care programs that meet at your hospital, or online.

You can also read more about these practices: [A to Z list of health topics](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health) from the NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

Palliative care aims to prevent or treat problems, starting at diagnosis. It’s care that addresses you as a whole person, not just your disease, including:

- [physical side effects](/node/905730) caused by cancer treatment
- [emotional](/node/858130) and mental health problems
- [spiritual](/node/5515) challenges
- practical and daily living
- [caregiver support](/node/859801)

[Palliative care specialists](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/805616) can also help to facilitate conversations between you, your family, and members of the health care team as well as discussions about the goals of treatment. It’s not just care that happens at the end of life. Learn more about [what palliative care is and who provides this care](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/care-choices/palliative-care-fact-sheet#who-gives-palliative-care).

Collaboration and clinical trials to advance care for young people

Collaboration between young people with cancer and the treatment team, including cancer researchers, is helping to design studies and programs that are more relevant to the needs of young people. You and your treatment team may learn more about working together in this article that discusses how [adolescents and young adults with cancer collaborated and served as advisors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083210/)for young adult programs.

There are a growing number of coping and support-related clinical trials for young people in the [NCI Clinical Trials database](/research/participate/clinical-trials-search) and the [NIH Clinical Trials database](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/finding-clinical-trial). One example is the [Trial of Individual Psychosocial Interventions for Cancer Patients](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01323309?cond=cancer%20&term=Psychosocial%20Problem&intr=Intervention%20&rank=5) that examined different types of counseling programs, such as meaning-center counseling and supportive counseling. Clinical trials such as these are helping to discover new and better ways to care for young people with cancer.
