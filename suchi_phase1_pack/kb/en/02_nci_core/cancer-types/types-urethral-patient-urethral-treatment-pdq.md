### Urethral cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the urethra.

The [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the tube that carries [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to outside the body. In women, the urethra is about 1½ inches long and is just above the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In men, the urethra is about 8 inches long, and goes through the [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the [penis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the outside of the body. In men, the urethra also carries [semen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Anatomy of the male urinary system (left panel) and female urinary system (right panel) showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The inside of the left kidney shows the renal pelvis. An inset shows the renal tubules and urine. Also shown are the prostate and penis (left panel) and the uterus (right panel). Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.

[Urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [rare cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791790&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that occurs more often in men than in women.

### There are different types of urethral cancer that begin in cells that line the urethra.

These [cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are named for the types of [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that become [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cancer):

- [Squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the most common type of urethral cancer. It forms in the thin, flat cells in the part of the urethra near the bladder in women, and in the lining of the urethra in the penis in men.
- [Transitional cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46629&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) forms in the area near the urethral opening in women, and in the part of the urethra that goes through the prostate gland in men.
- [Adenocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) forms in the [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are around the urethra in both men and women.

Urethral cancer can [metastasize](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46283&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (spread) quickly to [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) around the urethra and is often found in nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by the time it is [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### A history of bladder cancer can affect the risk of urethral cancer.

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for urethral cancer include the following:

- Having a [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [bladder cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444968&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that cause [chronic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the urethra, including:

- Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including [human papillomavirus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HPV), especially HPV type 16.
- Frequent [urinary tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [infections](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (UTIs).

### Signs of urethral cancer include bleeding or trouble with urination.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by urethral cancer or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early [stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:

- Trouble starting the flow of urine.
- Weak or interrupted ("stop-and-go") flow of urine.
- Frequent urination, especially at night.
- [Incontinence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Discharge](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443583&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the urethra.
- Bleeding from the urethra or [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the urine.
- A lump or thickness in the [perineum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321384&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or penis.
- A painless lump or swelling in the [groin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46375&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Tests that examine the urethra and bladder are used to diagnose urethral cancer.

The following tests and procedures may be used:

- **[Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
- **[Pelvic exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the vagina, [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [speculum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or [nurse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two [lubricated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924.jpg)![Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam. The uterus, left fallopian tube, left ovary, cervix, vagina, bladder, and rectum are shown.

Two gloved fingers of one hand of the doctor or nurse are shown inserted into the vagina, while the other hand is shown pressing on the lower abdomen. The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.")

Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.
- **[Digital rectal exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.
- **[Urine cytology](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270872&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A [laboratory test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which a sample of urine is checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for abnormal cells.
- **[Urinalysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), blood, and [white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If white blood cells (a sign of infection) are found, a [urine culture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is usually done to find out what type of infection it is.
- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- **[Complete blood count](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45107&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CBC)**: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:

- The number of [red blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), white blood cells, and [platelets](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45840&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- The amount of [hemoglobin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that carries [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in the red blood cells.
- The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[Ureteroscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354470&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look inside the [ureter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46638&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [renal pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46562&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for abnormal areas. A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. The ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis. A tool may be inserted through the ureteroscope to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/649520.jpg)![Drawing of a female and male ureteroscopy showing the lower pelvis of a female, including the right and left kidneys, renal pelvis, ureter, uterus, bladder, and urethra, and the lower pelvis of a male, including the ureter, bladder, prostate, urethra, and penis.

A ureteroscopy is a procedure that uses a ureteroscope (a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) to look inside the ureter and renal pelvis to check for abnormal areas. The ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis.
- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cell or tissue samples from the urethra, bladder, and, sometimes, the prostate gland. The samples are viewed under a microscope by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for signs of cancer.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following:

- Where the cancer formed in the urethra.
- Whether the cancer has spread through the [mucosa](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257213&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lining the urethra to nearby tissue, to lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.
- Whether the patient is a male or female.
- The patient's general health.
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).

## Stages of Urethral Cancer

### Key Points

- After urethral cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the urethra or to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- Urethral cancer is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected.
- Distal urethral cancer
- Proximal urethral cancer
- Bladder and/or prostate cancer may occur at the same time as urethral cancer.
- Urethral cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After urethral cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the urethra or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.

The following procedures may be used in the staging process:

- **[Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan) of the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the pelvis and abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the urethra, nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and other [soft tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45882&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bones in the pelvis. A substance called [gadolinium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597153&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **Urethrography**: A series of x-rays of the urethra. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. A dye is injected through the urethra into the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The dye coats the bladder and urethra and x-rays are taken to see if the urethra is blocked and if cancer has spread to nearby tissue.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if [urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually urethral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic urethral cancer, not [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### Urethral cancer is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected.

[Urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected and how deeply the tumor has spread into tissue around the urethra. Urethral cancer can be described as [distal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256557&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [proximal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256575&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/747935.jpg)![Distal and proximal urethra. Drawing on the left shows the female proximal and distal urethra; also shown are the bladder filled with urine, the ureters, and the uterus. Cross-section drawing on the right shows the male proximal and distal urethra. Also shown are the rectum, prostate gland, penis, and testis.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/747935-750.jpg "Distal and proximal urethra. Drawing on the left shows the female proximal and distal urethra; also shown are the bladder filled with urine, the ureters, and the uterus. Cross-section drawing on the right shows the male proximal and distal urethra. Also shown are the rectum, prostate gland, penis, and testis.")

Anatomy of the distal and proximal urethra. Urine flows out of the bladder and leaves the body through the urethra. The part of the urethra that is closest to the bladder is called the proximal urethra. The part that is closest to where the urine leaves the body is called the distal urethra. The urethra is about 8 inches long in men and about 1½ inches long in women.

#### Distal urethral cancer

In [distal urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=747977&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer usually has not spread deeply into the [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In women, the part of the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is closest to the outside of the body (about ½ inch) is affected. In men, the part of the urethra that is in the [penis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is affected.

#### Proximal urethral cancer

[Proximal urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=747979&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) affects the part of the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is not the [distal urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=749437&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In women and men, proximal urethral cancer usually has spread deeply into [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Bladder and/or prostate cancer may occur at the same time as urethral cancer.

In men, cancer that forms in the [proximal urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=749439&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the part of the urethra that passes through the [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the bladder) may occur at the same time as cancer of the bladder and/or prostate. Sometimes this occurs at [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and sometimes it occurs later.

### Urethral cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back in the urethra or in other parts of the body.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with urethral cancer.

Different types of treatments are available for patients with [urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for cancer of the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). One of the following types of surgery may be done:

- [Open excision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641952&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Removal of the cancer by surgery.
- [Transurethral resection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TUR): Surgery to remove the cancer using a special tool inserted into the urethra.
- Electroresection with [fulguration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46393&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the cancer by electric current. A lighted tool with a small wire loop on the end is used to remove the cancer or to burn the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) away with high-energy electricity.
- [Laser surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure that uses a [laser beam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45748&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to remove or destroy tissue.
- [Lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [groin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46375&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be removed.
- [Cystourethrectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the urethra.
- [Cystoprostatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446218&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the bladder and the [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Anterior exenteration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the urethra, the bladder, and the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Plastic surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269468&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done to rebuild the vagina.
- Partial [penectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446205&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the part of the [penis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) surrounding the urethra where cancer has spread. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the penis.
- Radical penectomy: Surgery to remove the entire penis. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the penis.

If the urethra is removed, the [surgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44306&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) will make a new way for the [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to pass from the body. This is called [urinary diversion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446222&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If the bladder is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for urine to be stored and passed from the body. The surgeon may use part of the [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to make a tube that passes urine through an opening ([stoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). This is called an [ostomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46251&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [urostomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46644&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If a patient has an ostomy, a disposable bag to collect urine is worn under clothing. The surgeon may also use part of the small intestine to make a new storage pouch ([continent reservoir](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) inside the body where the urine can collect. A tube ([catheter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) is then used to [drain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407759&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the urine through a stoma.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after surgery to kill any cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:

- [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
- [Internal radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substance sealed in needles, [seeds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat urethral cancer.

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra.

#### Active surveillance

[Active surveillance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=616060&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is following a patient's [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including [biopsies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), on a regular schedule.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for urethral cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## Treatment of Distal Urethral Cancer

For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/urethral/patient/urethral-treatment-pdq#_61) section.

Treatment of [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [mucosa](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257213&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (inside lining of the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that have not become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), may include [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([open excision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641952&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [transurethral resection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), electroresection with [fulguration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46393&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [laser surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of [distal urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=747977&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is different for men and women.

For women, treatment may include the following:

## Treatment of Urethral Cancer that Forms with Invasive Bladder Cancer

For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/urethral/patient/urethral-treatment-pdq#_61) section.

Treatment of [urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that forms at the same time as [invasive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45741&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [bladder cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444968&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include the following:

- [Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([cystourethrectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in women, or urethrectomy and [cystoprostatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446218&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in men).

## Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent Urethral Cancer

For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/urethral/patient/urethral-treatment-pdq#_61) section.

Treatment of [urethral cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that has [metastasized](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46283&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (spread to other parts of the body) is usually [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of [recurrent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) urethral cancer may include one or more of the following:

- [Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are also removed ([lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of urethral cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
