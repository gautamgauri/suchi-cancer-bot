- [FDA Approves HPV Tests That Allow for Self-Collection in a Health Care Setting](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-hpv-test-self-collection-health-care-setting)

Posted: July 24, 2024

The expanded approval of two HPV tests allows the patient to collect a vaginal sample themselves in a health care setting, rather than a health provider collecting a sample during a pelvic exam. The availability of a self-collection option in health care settings could help widen access to cervical cancer screening.
- [Simple Hysterectomy May Expand Treatment Options for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/cervical-cancer-simple-hysterectomy)

Posted: March 27, 2024

For some people with early-stage cervical cancer, a surgical procedure called a simple hysterectomy may be a safe and effective alternative to treatment with a radical hysterectomy, results from the SHAPE trial show.
- [Catch-Up HPV Testing May Help Prevent Cervical Cancer in Some Over Age 65](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/catch-up-hpv-testing-older-women)

Posted: September 1, 2023

It may be worthwhile for some individuals between ages 65 and 69 to get tested for HPV, findings from a Danish study suggest. Specifically, the testing may help prevent cervical cancer among those who haven’t had cervical cancer screening for at least 5 years.
- [More Evidence that One HPV Vaccine Dose Protects against Cancer-Causing Infections](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine-one-dose-kenya)

Posted: June 3, 2022

One dose of the HPV vaccine was highly effective in protecting young women against infection from high-risk HPV types, a study in Kenya found. A single dose would make HPV vaccines more accessible worldwide, reducing cervical cancer’s global burden.
- [Why Are Many Women Overdue for Cervical Cancer Screening?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/overdue-cervical-cancer-screening-increasing)

Posted: February 22, 2022

The rates of timely cervical cancer screening fell between 2005 and 2019, researchers found, and disparities existed among groups of women. The most common reason for not receiving timely screening was lack of knowledge about screening or not knowing they needed screening.
- [For Early-Stage Cervical Cancer, Minimally Invasive Surgery Declining](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/cervical-cancer-minimally-invasive-surgery-declining)

Posted: May 25, 2021

Fewer women with early-stage cervical cancer are having minimally invasive surgery, including robotic, as part of their treatment, a new study shows. The shift toward more open surgeries follows the release of results from the LACC trial in 2018.
- [Large Study Confirms that HPV Vaccine Prevents Cervical Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/hpv-vaccine-prevents-cervical-cancer-sweden-study)

Posted: October 14, 2020

Widespread HPV vaccine use dramatically reduces the number of women who will develop cervical cancer, according to a study of nearly 1.7 million women. Among girls vaccinated before age 17, the vaccine reduced cervical cancer incidence by 90%.
- [ACS’s Updated Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines Explained](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/cervical-cancer-screening-hpv-test-guideline)

Posted: September 18, 2020

Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society recommend HPV testing as the preferred approach. NCI’s Dr. Nicolas Wentzensen explains the changes and how they compare with other cervical cancer screening recommendations.
- [AI dual-stain approach improved accuracy, efficiency of cervical cancer screening in NCI study](/news-events/press-releases/2020/automated-dual-stain-cervical)

Posted: June 25, 2020

In a new study, an automated dual-stain method using artificial intelligence improved the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screening compared with the current standard for follow-up of women who test positive with primary HPV screening.
- [Single Dose of HPV Vaccine Yields Long-Term Protection from Many Cancer-Causing Types](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/hpv-vaccine-single-dose-long-term-protection)

Posted: April 10, 2020

More than a decade after vaccination, women who had received a single dose of the HPV vaccine continued to be protected against infection with the two cancer-causing HPV types targeted by the vaccine, an NCI-funded clinical trial shows.
- [Women Experience More Side Effects from Pelvic Radiation than Realized](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/patient-reported-side-effects-radiation-cervical-uterine-cancer)

Posted: April 8, 2020

Women with cervical or uterine cancer who received radiation to the pelvic region reported side effects much more often using an online reporting system called PRO-CTCAE than they did during conversations with their clinicians, a new study shows.
- [AI approach outperformed human experts in identifying cervical precancer](/news-events/press-releases/2019/deep-learning-cervical-cancer-screening)

Posted: January 10, 2019

A research team from NIH and Global Good has developed a computer algorithm that can analyze digital images of the cervix and identify precancerous changes that require medical attention. The AI approach could be valuable in low-resource settings.
- [For HPV-Positive Women, Test Can Guide Cervical Cancer Screening Follow-Up](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/dual-stain-test-cervical-hpv-positive)

Posted: October 11, 2018

A new test can help to improve the clinical management of women who screen positive for HPV infection during routine cervical cancer screening, an NCI-led study has shown.
- [New Immunotherapy Option Approved for Cervical Cancer, Rare Lymphoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/pembrolizumab-approved-fda-cervical-pmbcl)

Posted: August 2, 2018

FDA has approved pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for some women with advanced cervical cancer and some patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- [Study Identifies Crucial Characteristic of High-Risk HPV](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/hpv-viral-gene)

Posted: October 5, 2017

By comparing the genomes of women infected with a high-risk type of human papillomavirus (HPV), researchers have found that a precise DNA sequence of a viral gene is associated with cervical cancer.
- [TCGA study identifies genomic features of cervical cancer](/news-events/press-releases/2017/tcga-cervical-cancer)

Posted: January 23, 2017

Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified novel genomic and molecular characteristics of cervical cancer that will aid in subclassification of the disease and may help target therapies that are most appropriate for each patient.
