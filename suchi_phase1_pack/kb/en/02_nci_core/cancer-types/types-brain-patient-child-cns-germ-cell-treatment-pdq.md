### Childhood central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors form from germ cells.

[Germ cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46382&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are the [reproductive cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46563&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in a [fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These cells later become [sperm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [testicles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or unfertilized eggs in the [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Sometimes the germ cells travel to or from other parts of the fetus as it develops and later become [germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Most germ cell tumors form in the testes or ovaries. Germ cell tumors that form in the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are called [CNS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45643&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (central nervous system) germ cell tumors.

CNS germ cell tumors occur most often in young people aged 10 to 19 years. They are more common in males than in females. In older children, CNS germ cell tumors usually form in the brain near the [pineal gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46226&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and in an area of the brain that includes the [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) just above it. Sometimes germ cell tumors form in other areas of the brain.

Anatomy of the inside of the brain, showing the pineal and pituitary glands, optic nerve, ventricles (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), and other parts of the brain.

The cause of most childhood CNS germ cell tumors is not known.

This summary is about germ cell tumors that start in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Germ cell tumors may also form in other parts of the body. For information on germ cell tumors that are [extracranial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443318&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (outside the brain), see [Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment](/types/extracranial-germ-cell/patient/germ-cell-treatment-pdq).

Treatment of CNS germ cell tumors may be different for children and adults. For information about treatment for adults, see the following PDQ summaries:

- [Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment](/types/brain/patient/adult-brain-treatment-pdq)
- [Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors Treatment](/types/extragonadal-germ-cell/patient/extragonadal-treatment-pdq)

### There are different types of childhood CNS germ cell tumors.

Different types of CNS germ cell tumors can form from the germ cells that later become sperm or unfertilized eggs. The type of CNS germ cell tumor that is [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depends on what the cells look like under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and results of [laboratory tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that check [tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels.

This summary is about the treatment of several types of CNS germ cell tumors.

#### Germinomas

[Germinomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=800814&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are the most common type of CNS germ cell tumor and have a good [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Tumor marker levels are not used to diagnose germinomas.

#### Nongerminomas

Some [nongerminomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=800816&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) make [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [alpha-fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AFP) and [beta-human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (beta-hCG). Types of nongerminomas include:

- [Embryonal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367442&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [carcinomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45963&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) make the hormone AFP.
- [Yolk sac tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791306&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) make the hormone AFP.
- [Choriocarcinomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46753&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) make the hormone beta-hCG.
- [Mixed germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791309&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are made of more than one kind of germ cell. They may make AFP and beta-hCG.

#### Teratomas

CNS [teratomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44248&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are described as [mature](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443575&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [immature](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443576&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), based on how normal the cells look under a microscope. Mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a microscope and are made of different kinds of tissue, such as hair, muscle, and bone. Immature teratomas look very different from normal cells under a microscope and are made of cells that look like fetal cells. Some immature teratomas are a mix of mature and immature cells. Tumor marker levels are not used to diagnose teratomas.

### Signs and symptoms of childhood CNS germ cell tumors include unusual thirst, frequent urination, or vision changes.

[Signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depend on:

- Where the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed.
- The size of the tumor.
- Whether the tumor or the body make too much of certain hormones.

Signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood CNS germ cell tumors or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your child's doctor if your child has:

- Excess thirst.
- Large amounts of [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is clear or almost clear.
- Frequent urination.
- Bed-wetting or frequent urination at night.
- Trouble moving the eyes or seeing clearly.
- Double vision.
- Loss of [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Weight loss for no known reason.
- Early [puberty](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440113&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Headaches.
- [Nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [vomiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Feeling very tired.
- Problems with schoolwork.

### Imaging studies and other tests are used to help diagnose childhood CNS germ cell tumors.

In addition to asking about your child's [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **[Neurological exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) function. The exam checks a person's mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, reflexes, and [senses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=792756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.
- **Visual field exam**: An exam to check a person's field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). The eyes are tested one at a time. The eye not being tested is covered.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging) with and without [gadolinium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597153&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The gadolinium may collect around the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[Lumbar puncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46303&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure used to collect [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CSF) from the [spinal column](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=396787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and into the lining around the spinal cord to remove a sample of the CSF. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells and tested for tumor markers. The amount of [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the sample may also be tested. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/503953.jpg)![Lumbar puncture; drawing shows a patient lying in a curled position on a table and a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) being inserted into the lower back. Inset shows a close-up of the spinal needle inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lower part of the spinal column.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/503953-750.jpg "Lumbar puncture; drawing shows a patient lying in a curled position on a table and a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) being inserted into the lower back. Inset shows a close-up of the spinal needle inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lower part of the spinal column.")

Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.
- **[Tumor marker tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=732562&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a sample of [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or CSF normally by [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and tissues, or at [abnormally](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) high levels by tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found at increased levels in the blood or CSF. These are called tumor markers.

The following tumor markers are used to diagnose some CNS germ cell tumors:

- [Alpha-fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AFP).
- [Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (beta-hCG).
- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher- or lower-than-normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- **Blood hormone studies**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher- or lower-than-normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. The blood will be checked for the levels of hormones made by the [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of a CNS germ cell tumor.

If doctors think your child may have a CNS germ cell tumor, a [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done. For [brain tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=387264&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the biopsy can be done by removing part of the [skull](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or making a small hole in the skull and using a needle or surgical device to remove a sample of tissue. Sometimes, when a needle is used, it is guided by a computer to remove the tissue sample. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/691155.jpg)![Drawing of a craniotomy showing a section of the scalp that has been pulled back to remove a piece of the skull; the dura covering the brain has been opened to expose the brain. The layer of muscle under the scalp is also shown.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/691155-750.jpg "Drawing of a craniotomy showing a section of the scalp that has been pulled back to remove a piece of the skull; the dura covering the brain has been opened to expose the brain. The layer of muscle under the scalp is also shown.")

Craniotomy. An opening is made in the skull and a piece of the skull is removed to show part of the brain.

The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:

- **[Immunohistochemistry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653117&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A laboratory test that uses [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for certain [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in a sample of a patient's tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.

Sometimes the diagnosis can be made based on the results of [imaging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46361&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and tumor marker tests and a biopsy is not needed.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).

The prognosis depends on:

- The type of germ cell tumor.
- The type and level of any tumor markers.
- Where the tumor is in the brain or in the spinal cord.
- Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord or to other parts of the body.
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back) after treatment.

## Stages of Childhood CNS Germ Cell Tumors

### Key Points

- Childhood central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors rarely spread outside of the brain and spinal cord.
- Sometimes childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors come back after treatment.

### Childhood central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors rarely spread outside of the brain and spinal cord.

The process used to find out how much [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) there is and whether the cancer has spread is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is no standard [staging system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for childhood [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CNS) [germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The [treatment plan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depends on:

- The type of germ cell tumor.
- Whether the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body, such as the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or bone.
- The results of [tests and procedures](/types/brain/patient/child-cns-germ-cell-treatment-pdq#_16) done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) childhood CNS germ cell tumors.
- Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back) after treatment.

### Sometimes childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors come back after treatment.

The tumors usually recur (come back) where they first formed. The tumors may also come back in other places and/or in the [meninges](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46295&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (thin layers of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord).

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for children with central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors.
- Children with CNS germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned
by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating
cancer in children.
- The following types of treatment are used:
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Surgery
- High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
trials.
- Treatment for childhood CNS germ cell tumors may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a
clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or
after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up care may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for children with central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors.

Different types of
treatment are available for children with [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CNS) [germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some
treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and
some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical
trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current
treatments or obtain information on new treatments for people
with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is
better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may
become the standard treatment.

Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical
trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only
to patients who have not started treatment.

### Children with CNS germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.

Treatment will be overseen by a [pediatric oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=693555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or a [radiation oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46546&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A pediatric oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. A radiation oncologist specializes in treating cancer with [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These doctors work with other [pediatric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who
are experts in treating children with CNS germ cell tumors and who specialize
in certain areas of [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These may include the following
[specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Pediatrician](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=757278&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Pediatric [neurosurgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Neurologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Endocrinologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46439&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Ophthalmologist.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=631048&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- [Pediatric nurse specialist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318821&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Rehabilitation specialist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318825&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Psychologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44716&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Social worker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44730&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Fertility specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that
uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill
cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing.

[External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a
machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This type of radiation therapy may include:

- [Stereotactic radiosurgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the [skull](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of radiation directly at the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This procedure does not involve [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.

Radiation therapy to the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can affect growth and development in young children. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can lessen the damage to healthy brain tissue. For children younger than 3 years, [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be given instead. This can delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy.

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy
is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the
drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells
throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

#### Surgery

Whether surgery to remove the tumor can be done depends on where the tumor is in the brain. Surgery to remove the tumor may cause severe, long-term [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Surgery may be done to remove [teratomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44248&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and may be used for germ cell tumors that come back. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen
at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given
chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any
cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue

High doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. [Stem cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about clinical trials is available from the
[NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for childhood CNS germ cell tumors may cause side effects.

To learn more about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that begin during treatment for cancer, visit [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects").

Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called [late effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Late effects of cancer
treatment may include:

- Physical problems, including:

- Vision problems.
- [Endocrine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems, such as [diabetes insipidus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683346&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems, such as [stroke](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439425&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or
memory.
- [Second cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (new types of cancer).

Some late effects may be treated or controlled. Talk with your child's doctors about the possible late
effects caused by some treatments. Learn more at [Late Effects of Treatment
for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-pdq).

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up care may be needed.

As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

Children whose cancer affected their [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when the cancer was diagnosed will usually need to have their blood [hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels checked. If the blood hormone level is low, replacement hormone medicine is given.

Children who had a high [tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level ([alpha-fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [beta-human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) when the cancer was diagnosed usually need to have their blood tumor marker level checked. If the tumor marker level increases after initial treatment, the tumor may have recurred.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood central nervous system germ cell tumors. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
