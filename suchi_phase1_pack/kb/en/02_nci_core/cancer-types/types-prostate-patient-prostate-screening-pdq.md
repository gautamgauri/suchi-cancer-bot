# Prostate Cancer Screening (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Screening?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq)

[Screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is looking for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before a person has any [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can help find
cancer at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or cancer is found early, it may
be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun
to spread.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are trying to better understand which
people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things
we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This
information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which
screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.

It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily
think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening
tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms. Screening tests may be repeated on a regular basis.

If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called [diagnostic tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45959&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## General Information About Prostate Cancer

### Key Points

- Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
form in the tissues of the prostate.
- Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in
the United States.
- Different factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.

The [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a
[gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the male
[reproductive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It lies just
below the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
collects and empties [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and in
front of the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the lower part
of the [intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). It is about the
size of a walnut and surrounds part of the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the tube that empties urine from the
bladder). The prostate gland makes [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is part of the [semen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems showing the ureters, bladder, prostate gland, urethra, penis, testicles, and other organs.

As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the
flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is called [benign prostatic hyperplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46509&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (BPH). BPH is not [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be
needed to correct it. The [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
of BPH or of other problems in the prostate may be
similar to symptoms of [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/462221.jpg)![Two-panel drawing shows normal male reproductive and urinary anatomy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Panel on the left shows the normal prostate and flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra. Panel on the right shows an enlarged prostate pressing on the bladder and urethra, blocking the flow of urine.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/462221-750.jpg "Two-panel drawing shows normal male reproductive and urinary anatomy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Panel on the left shows the normal prostate and flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra. Panel on the right shows an enlarged prostate pressing on the bladder and urethra, blocking the flow of urine.")

Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.

### Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in the United States.

Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the United States, about one out of every eight men will be [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with prostate cancer. Most men diagnosed with this disease do not die from it. Prostate cancer causes more deaths in men than any other cancer except [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Prostate cancer occurs more often in Black men than in White men. Black men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer.

### Different factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer.

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease
is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a [protective factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Prostate Cancer Screening

### Key Points

- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- There is no standard or routine screening test for prostate cancer.
- Digital rectal exam
- Prostate-specific antigen test
- A prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) RNA test may be used for certain patients.
- Screening tests for prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

### Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) study [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of [recovery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is better if the disease is found and treated at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### There is no standard or routine screening test for prostate cancer.

Although there are no standard or routine screening tests for [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the following tests are being used or studied to screen for it:

#### Digital rectal exam

[Digital rectal exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (DRE) is an exam of the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The doctor or [nurse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) inserts a [lubricated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel the [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for lumps or anything else that seems unusual, such as an enlarged prostate.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/457840.jpg)![Digital rectal exam; drawing shows a side view of the male reproductive anatomy and the urinary anatomy, including the prostate, rectum, and bladder. Also shown is a gloved, lubricated finger inserted into the rectum to feel the rectum, anus, and prostate.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/457840-750.jpg "Digital rectal exam; drawing shows a side view of the male reproductive anatomy and the urinary anatomy, including the prostate, rectum, and bladder. Also shown is a gloved, lubricated finger inserted into the rectum to feel the rectum, anus, and prostate.")

Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.

#### Prostate-specific antigen test

A [prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322878&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a test that measures the level of [PSA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44867&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). PSA is a substance made mostly by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. The level of PSA may also be high in men who have an [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the prostate or [benign prostatic hyperplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46509&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (BPH; an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).

A PSA test or a DRE may be able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage, but it is not clear whether early detection and treatment decrease the risk of dying from prostate cancer.

Studies are being done to find ways to make PSA testing more accurate for early cancer detection.

### A prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) RNA test may be used for certain patients.

If a man had a high PSA level and a [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the prostate did not show cancer and the PSA level remains high after the biopsy, a [PCA3 RNA test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798759&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done. This test measures the amount of PCA3 RNA in the [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after a DRE. If the PCA3 RNA level is higher than normal, another prostate biopsy may be needed to help [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer.

### Screening tests for prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

## Risks of Prostate Cancer Screening

### Key Points

- Screening tests have risks.
- The risks of prostate cancer screening include:
- Finding prostate cancer that may never cause symptoms or become life threatening.
- Complications from a follow-up biopsy can occur.
- False-negative test results can occur.
- False-positive test results can occur.

### Screening tests have risks.

Decisions about [screening tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810044&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful, and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may
want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of
the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from
[cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### The risks of prostate cancer screening include:

#### Finding prostate cancer that may never cause symptoms or become life threatening.

Screening
may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have cancer that has already spread to the area outside of the [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to
other places in your body.

Some prostate cancers never cause [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
or become life-threatening, but if found by a screening
test, the cancer may be treated. Finding these cancers is called [overdiagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=759894&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is not known if treatment of these cancers would help you live longer than if no treatment were given.

Treatments for [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [radical prostatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46549&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), may have long-term [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in many men. The most common side effects are [erectile dysfunction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321372&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [urinary incontinence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Some studies of patients with newly [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer showed these patients had a higher risk of death from [cardiovascular](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44005&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (heart and [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) disease or [suicide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The risk was greatest in the first weeks or months after [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Complications from a follow-up biopsy can occur.

If a [PSA test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322878&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is higher than normal, a [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the prostate may be done. [Complications](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463706&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from a biopsy of the prostate may include [fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), pain, [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [semen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [urinary tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Even if a biopsy shows that a patient does not have prostate cancer, he may worry more about developing prostate cancer in the future.

[Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)−guided biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=805156&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is being studied in the [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of prostate cancer, either in place of, or in addition to, [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689630&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate [needle biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45798&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### False-negative test results can occur.

Screening test results may appear to be normal even though prostate cancer is
present. A man who receives a [false-negative test result](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (one that
shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if he has symptoms.

#### False-positive test results can occur.

Screening test results may appear to be [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) even though no
cancer is present. A [false-positive test result](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is usually followed by more tests and procedures (such as
a biopsy), which also have risks.

Your doctor can advise you about your risk for prostate cancer and your need for screening tests.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about prostate cancer screening. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
