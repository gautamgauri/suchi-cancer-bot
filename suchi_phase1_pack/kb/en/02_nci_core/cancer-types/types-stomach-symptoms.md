Stomach pain or discomfort can be a symptom of stomach cancer.

Early on, stomach cancer usually doesn’t have symptoms, making it hard to detect. Symptoms usually begin after the cancer has spread.

When symptoms of [early-stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000561398&version=Patient&language=en) stomach cancer do occur, they may include

- indigestion and stomach discomfort
- a bloated feeling after eating
- mild nausea
- loss of appetite
- heartburn

Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer (cancer has spread beyond the stomach to other parts of the body) may include the symptoms of early-stage stomach cancer and

- blood in the stool
- vomiting
- weight loss for no known reason
- stomach pain
- jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin)
- [ascites](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/ascites) (buildup of fluid in the abdomen)
- trouble swallowing

These symptoms may be caused by many conditions other than stomach cancer. It’s important to check with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Your doctor will ask when your symptoms started and how often you’ve been having them. If it is stomach cancer, ignoring symptoms can delay treatment and make it less effective.
