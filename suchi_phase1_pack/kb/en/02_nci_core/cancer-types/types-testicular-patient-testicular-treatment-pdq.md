### Testicular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.

The [testicles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are 2 egg-shaped [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) located inside the [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a sac of loose skin that lies
directly below the [penis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The testicles are held within the scrotum by the [spermatic cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which also contains the [vas deferens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44309&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and vessels and [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the testicles. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/457830.jpg)![Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems; drawing shows front and side views of ureters, lymph nodes, rectum, bladder, prostate gland, vas deferens, urethra, penis, testicles, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/457830-750.jpg "Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems; drawing shows front and side views of ureters, lymph nodes, rectum, bladder, prostate gland, vas deferens, urethra, penis, testicles, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct.")

Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems, showing the testicles, prostate, bladder, and other organs.

The testicles are the male sex glands and produce [testosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45581&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [sperm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Germ cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46382&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) within the testicles produce immature sperm that travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and larger tubes into the [epididymis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615503&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a long coiled tube next to the testicles) where the sperm mature and are stored.

Almost all [testicular cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) start in the germ cells. The two main types of [testicular germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=695185&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [seminomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [nonseminomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These 2 types grow and spread differently and are treated differently. Nonseminomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. Seminomas are more sensitive to [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A testicular [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that contains both seminoma and nonseminoma [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is treated as a nonseminoma.

Testicular cancer is the most common [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in men 20 to 35 years old.

### Health history can affect the risk of testicular cancer.

Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop testicular cancer, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include:

- Having had an [undescended testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44388&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having had [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) development of the testicles.
- Having a [personal history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of testicular cancer.
- Having a [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of testicular cancer (especially in a father or brother).
- Being White.

### Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include swelling or discomfort in the scrotum.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by testicular cancer or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:

- A painless lump or swelling in either testicle.
- A change in how the testicle feels.
- A dull ache in the lower [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the [groin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46375&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- A sudden build-up of [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the scrotum.
- Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum.

### Tests that examine the testicles and blood are used to diagnose testicular cancer.

In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **Physical exam of the [testes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367406&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam in which a doctor checks for lumps, swelling, or pain in the testicles.
- **[Ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam of the testes**: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Serum tumor marker test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a sample of [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The following tumor markers are used to detect testicular cancer:

- [Alpha-fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AFP).
- [Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (beta-hCG).

Tumor marker levels are measured before [inguinal orchiectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46346&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), to help [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) testicular cancer.
- **Inguinal orchiectomy**: A procedure to remove the entire testicle through an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the groin. A tissue sample from the testicle is then viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for cancer cells. (The [surgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44306&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) does not cut through the scrotum into the testicle to remove a sample of tissue for biopsy, because if cancer is present, this procedure could cause it to spread into the scrotum and [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It's important to choose a surgeon who has experience with this kind of [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).) If cancer is found, the cell type (seminoma or nonseminoma) is determined in order to help plan treatment.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)  and treatment options depend on the following:

- [Stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer (whether it is in or near the testicle or has spread to other places in the body, and blood levels of AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH).
- Type of cancer.
- Size of the tumor.
- Number and size of [retroperitoneal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44257&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lymph nodes.

Testicular cancer can usually be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in patients who receive [adjuvant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after their [primary treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=589417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Treatment for testicular cancer can cause infertility.

Certain treatments for testicular cancer can cause [infertility](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46348&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that may be permanent. Patients who may wish to have children should consider [sperm banking](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43974&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before having treatment. Sperm banking is the process of freezing sperm and storing it for later use.

## Stages of Testicular Cancer

### Key Points

- After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- The following stages are used for testicular cancer:
- Stage 0
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Testicular cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [testicles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other
parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the
staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know
the stage in order to plan treatment.

The following tests and
procedures may be used in the staging process:

- **[Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[Abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) procedure in which [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. For patients with [nonseminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease. Cancer cells in the lymph nodes of [seminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients can be treated with [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Serum tumor marker test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a sample of [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The following 3 tumor markers are used in staging [testicular cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Alpha-fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AFP)
- [Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (beta-hCG).
- [Lactate dehydrogenase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LDH).

Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### The following stages are used for testicular cancer:

#### Stage 0

In [stage 0](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=368450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the tiny tubules where the [sperm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread into nearby normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). All [tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called germ cell neoplasia in situ.

#### Stage I

In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45126&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA, IB, and IS.

- In stage IA, [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including the [rete testis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=794361&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but has not spread to the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the testicle.

All [tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels are normal.
- In stage IB, [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- is found in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including the [rete testis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=794361&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and has spread to the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the testicle; or
- has spread into the [hilar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [soft tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45882&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) made of [fibers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and fat with blood vessels and lymph vessels), the [epididymis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615503&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or the outer [membranes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46294&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) around the testicle; or
- has spread to the [spermatic cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or
- has spread to the [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

All [tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels are normal.
- In stage IS, [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found anywhere in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and may have spread into the [spermatic cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels range from slightly above normal to high.

#### Stage III

[Stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45128&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.

- In stage IIIA, [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found anywhere in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and may have spread into the [spermatic cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer may have spread to one or more nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes or to the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The level of one or more [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is high.

***or***

[Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found anywhere in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and may have spread into the [spermatic cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer has not spread to distant [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but has spread to other parts of the body, such as the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or bone.

[Tumor marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels may range from normal to high.

### Testicular cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back many years after the initial cancer, in the other testicle or in other parts of the body.

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer.
- Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment.
- Good Prognosis
- Intermediate Prognosis
- Poor Prognosis
- The following types of treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Surveillance
- High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for testicular cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer.

Different types of treatments are available for patients with [testicular cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment.

#### Good Prognosis

For [nonseminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), all of the following must be true:

- The [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found only in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or in the [retroperitoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44257&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (area outside or behind the [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) wall); and
- The tumor has not spread to [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) other than the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); and
- The levels of all the [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are slightly above normal.

For [seminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), all of the following must be true:

- The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and
- The level of [alpha-fetoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AFP) is normal. [Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (beta-hCG) and [lactate dehydrogenase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LDH) may be at any level.

#### Intermediate Prognosis

For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:

- The tumor is found in one testicle only or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and
- The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and
- The level of any one of the tumor markers is more than slightly above normal.

For seminoma, all of the following must be true:

- The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and
- The level of AFP is normal. Beta-hCG and LDH may be at any level.

#### Poor Prognosis

For nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true:

- The tumor is in the center of the chest between the lungs; or
- The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or
- The level of any one of the tumor markers is high.

There is no poor [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grouping for seminoma testicular tumors.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the testicle ([inguinal orchiectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46346&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and some of the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done at [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). (See the [General Information](/types/testicular/patient/testicular-treatment-pdq#_19) and [Stages](/types/testicular/patient/testicular-treatment-pdq#_27) sections of this summary.) Tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after surgery to kill any cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

See [Drugs Approved for Testicular Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/testicular "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/testicular") for more information.

#### Surveillance

[Surveillance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=496506&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is closely following a patient's [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that the cancer has recurred (come back). In surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule.

#### High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant

High [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. [Stem cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient or a [donor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.

See [Drugs Approved for Testicular Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/testicular "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/testicular") for more information.

Donor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for testicular cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. A patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away.

Long-term [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exams are very important. The patient will probably have
check-ups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that.

## Treatment of Stage I Testicular Cancer

For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/testicular/patient/testicular-treatment-pdq#_55) section.

Treatment of [stage I testicular cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45126&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) depends on whether the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [seminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a [nonseminoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of seminoma may include the following:

- [Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), followed by [surveillance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=496506&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- For patients who want active treatment rather than surveillance, treatment may include:

- Surgery to remove the testicle, followed by [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:

- Surgery to remove the testicle, with long-term [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Surgery to remove the testicle and lymph nodes in the abdomen, with long-term follow-up.
- Surgery followed by chemotherapy for patients at high risk of [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), with long-term follow-up.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of testicular cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
