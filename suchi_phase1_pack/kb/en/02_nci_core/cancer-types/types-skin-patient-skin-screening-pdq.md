# Skin Cancer Screening (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Screening?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/skin/hp/skin-screening-pdq)

[Screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is looking for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before a person has any [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can help find
cancer at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or cancer is found early, it may
be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun
to spread.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are trying to better understand which
people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things
we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This
information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which
screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.

It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily
think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening
tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.

If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called [diagnostic tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45959&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## General Information About Skin Cancer

### Key Points

- Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form
in the tissues of the skin.
- Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United
States.
- Different factors increase or decrease
the risk of skin cancer.

### Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.

The skin is the body's largest [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It protects against heat,
sunlight, injury, and [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and [vitamin D](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=427253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the [epidermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46418&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (top or outer layer) and the [dermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46454&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (lower or inner layer). [Skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445084&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Squamous cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46056&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that forms in the skin's squamous cells is called [squamous cell carcinoma of the skin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787988&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Basal cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46516&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Round cells under the squamous cells. Cancer that forms in basal cells is called [basal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46515&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Melanocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Found
in the lower part of the epidermis, these cells make [melanin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46291&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [pigment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46225&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes
make more pigment and cause the skin to tan, or darken. Cancer that forms in melanocytes is called [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.

There are two main types of skin cancer:

- [nonmelanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46261&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [keratinocyte carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=814529&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which includes:

- squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
- basal cell carcinoma
- melanoma

Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, also called nonmelanoma skin cancer or keratinocyte carcinoma, are the most common forms of skin cancer. Most basal cell and squamous cell
skin cancers can be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure. Melanoma is easier to cure if the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found before it spreads to the dermis (inner layer of skin). Melanoma is less likely to cause death when it is found and treated early.

In the United States, about 3 million people are diagnosed with nonmelanoma skin cancer each year. Rates of nonmelanoma skin cancer have been increasing, possibly because greater public awareness has led to higher rates of screening exams, self-exams, and detection of these skin cancers.

Since the early 2000s, the rate of melanoma cases in adults younger than 50 years has held steady in women, but decreased by about 1% per year in men. In adults aged 50 years and older, the rate of melanoma cases has held steady in men, but increased by about 3% per year in women in recent years. From 2013 to 2022, the number of deaths from melanoma decreased by about 3% per year in men and 4% per year in women.

The rate of melanoma cases in children and [adolescents](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776825&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) increased until 2001. However, between 2001 and 2022, the yearly rates of melanoma in these age groups decreased slightly.

### Different factors increase or decrease the risk of skin cancer.

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease
is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a [protective factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Skin Cancer Screening

### Key Points

- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- Screening for skin cancer may include examination by both the patient and the health care provider.
- Screening tests for skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

### Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) study [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of [recovery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is better if the disease is found and treated at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is not enough evidence to know if screening the population for skin cancer lowers the rates of death from the disease.

### Screening for skin cancer may include examination by both the patient and the health care provider.

A visual self-exam by the patient and a clinical examination by the health care provider may be used to screen for skin cancer.

During a skin exam a doctor or nurse checks the skin for [moles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46286&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), birthmarks, or other pigmented areas that look [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in color, size, shape, or texture. Skin exams to screen for skin cancer have not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease.

Regular skin checks by a doctor are important for people who have
already had skin cancer. If you are checking your skin and find a worrisome change, you should report it to your doctor.

If an area on the skin looks
abnormal, a [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is usually done. The doctor will remove as much of the suspicious tissue as possible with a [local](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45755&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [excision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) then looks at the
tissue under a microscope to check
for cancer cells. Because it is sometimes difficult to tell if a skin growth is
benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer), you may want to have the biopsy sample checked by a second pathologist.

Most [melanomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the skin can be seen by the
naked eye. Usually, melanoma grows for a long time under
the top layer of skin (the [epidermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46418&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) but does not grow into the deeper layer (the [dermis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46454&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). This allows time for skin cancer to be found early. Melanoma is easier to [cure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) if it is found before it spreads.

Mobile apps that evaluate skin lesions to detect skin cancer and malignant melanoma have been developed. However, these apps require further study in large-scale testing programs to find out if they are accurate and useful for skin cancer screening.

### Screening tests for skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

## Risks of Skin Cancer Screening

### Key Points

- Screening tests have risks.
- The risks of skin cancer screening tests include:
- Finding skin cancer does not always improve health or help you live
longer.
- False-negative test results can occur.
- False-positive test results can occur.
- A biopsy may cause scarring.

### Screening tests have risks.

Decisions about [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may
want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of
the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from
cancer.

### The risks of skin cancer screening tests include:

#### Finding skin cancer does not always improve health or help you live longer.

Screening
may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445084&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Some cancers never cause [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
or become life-threatening, but if found by a screening
test, the cancer may be treated. Treatments for cancer may have serious [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### False-negative test results can occur.

Screening test results may appear to be normal even though cancer is
present. A person who receives a [false-negative test result](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (one that
shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay getting medical care even if there are symptoms.

#### False-positive test results can occur.

Screening test results may appear to be [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) even though no
cancer is present. A [false-positive test result](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is usually followed by more tests (such as
a [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), which also have risks.

#### A biopsy may cause scarring.

When a skin biopsy is done, the doctor will try to leave the
smallest scar possible, but there is a risk of scarring and [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Talk to your doctor about your risk for skin cancer and your need for screening tests.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about skin cancer screening. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
