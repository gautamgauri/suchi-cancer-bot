# Immunotherapy Side Effects

Immunotherapy can cause side effects. Many side effects happen when the immune system that is revved-up to act against the cancer also acts against healthy cells and tissues in the body.

Different people have different side effects. The ones you have and how they make you feel will depend on

- how healthy you are before treatment
- your type of cancer
- how advanced your cancer is
- the type and dose of immunotherapy you are getting

You might be on immunotherapy for a long time. And side effects can occur at any point during and after treatment. Doctors and nurses cannot know for certain when or if side effects will occur or how serious they will be. So, it is important to talk with your doctors and nurses about what signs to look for and what to do if you start to have problems.

Some side effects are common with all types of immunotherapy. For instance, you might have skin reactions at the needle site, which include:

Larger circles indicate common conditions, and smaller ones indicate rarer issues. Conditions include central neurologic disorder, hypothyroidism, myocarditis, pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, AKI (acute kidney injury), anemia, lymphopenia, and skin-related issues.
