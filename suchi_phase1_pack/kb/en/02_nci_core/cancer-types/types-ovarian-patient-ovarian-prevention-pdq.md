# Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Prevention?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-prevention-pdq)

[Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is action taken to lower the chance of getting
cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer
in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower
the number of deaths caused by cancer.

To prevent new cancers from starting, [scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) look at [risk
factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that increases your
chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor;
anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is
called a cancer protective factor.

Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot.
For example, both smoking and inheriting certain [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are
risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be
avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be protective
factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and
increasing protective factors may lower your risk, but it does
not mean that you will not get cancer.

Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:

- Changing lifestyle or eating habits.
- Avoiding things known to cause cancer.
- Taking [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treat a [precancerous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to
keep cancer from starting.

## General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers

### Key Points

- Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells
form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
- Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the
female reproductive system.

### Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.

The [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are a pair
of [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the female [reproductive
system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They are in the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), one on each side of the
[uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the hollow, pear-shaped
organ where a [fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grows). Each
ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and
female [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
control the way certain [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or
organs work in the body).

The [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.

The [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that lines the [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) wall and covers organs in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Primary peritoneal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.

Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.

### Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the female reproductive system.

[Ovarian cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445074&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is most common in [postmenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women. From 2012 to 2021, the number of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year. There was also a slight decrease in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2013 to 2022.

Women who have a [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of ovarian cancer and/or have [inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain changes in [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as the *[BRCA1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46047&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* or *[BRCA2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* gene, have a higher risk than those who do not have a family history or who have not inherited these gene changes. For women with inherited risk, [genetic counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [genetic testing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46128&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be used to find out more about their likelihood of developing ovarian cancer.

It is hard to find ovarian cancer early. Early ovarian cancer may not cause any [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When symptoms do appear, ovarian cancer is often [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- Family history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers
- Inherited risk
- Hormone replacement therapy
- Weight and height
- Endometriosis
- The following are *protective* factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:
- Oral contraceptives
- Tubal ligation
- Giving birth
- Salpingectomy
- Breastfeeding
- Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy
- It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:
- Diet

to prevent cancer.
- New ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical
trials.

### Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.

Avoiding [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having [overweight](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and not getting enough exercise. Increasing [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.

### The following are *risk* factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:

#### Family history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers

A woman whose mother or sister had ovarian cancer has an increased risk of ovarian cancer. A woman with two or more relatives with ovarian cancer also has an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

#### Inherited risk

The risk of ovarian cancer is increased in women who have [inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain changes in [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as the *[BRCA1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46047&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* or *[BRCA2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* gene.

The risk of ovarian cancer is also increased in women who have certain [inherited syndromes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339343&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as:

- [Familial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256552&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) site-specific ovarian cancer syndrome.
- Familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.
- [Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44884&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HNPCC; also called [Lynch syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44882&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

#### Hormone replacement therapy

There is a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who are taking [hormone replacement therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46127&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HRT) after [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is also an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who have recently used HRT, even if they used it for less than 5 years. The risk of ovarian cancer is the same for HRT with [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only or with combined estrogen and [progestin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
HRT taken through the skin may have a lower risk than HRT taken by mouth. When HRT is stopped, the risk of ovarian cancer decreases over time.
The risk of ovarian cancer is not affected by the age of the woman when taking HRT.

#### Weight and height

Having excess body weight or [obesity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Obesity is also linked to an increased risk of death from ovarian cancer. Being tall may also be linked to a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer.

#### Endometriosis

Women who have [endometriosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46427&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

### The following are *protective* factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:

#### Oral contraceptives

Taking [oral contraceptives](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443306&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ("the pill") lowers the risk of ovarian
cancer. The longer oral contraceptives are used, the lower the risk may
be. The decrease in risk may last up to 30 years after a woman has stopped taking oral
contraceptives.

Taking oral contraceptives increases the risk of [blood clots](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476017&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This risk is higher in women who also smoke.

#### Tubal ligation

The risk of ovarian cancer is decreased in women who have a [tubal ligation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44926&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to close both [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

#### Giving birth

Women who have given birth have a decreased risk of ovarian cancer compared to women who have not given birth. Giving birth to more than one child further decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.

#### Salpingectomy

Some studies have shown that salpingectomy (surgery to remove one or both fallopian tubes) is linked to a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. When both fallopian tubes are removed, the risk of ovarian cancer is lowered more than when one fallopian tube is removed.

#### Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding is linked to a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. The longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk of ovarian cancer. Women who breastfeed for at least 8 to 10 months have the greatest decrease in risk of ovarian cancer.

#### Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy

Some women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (surgery to remove the fallopian tubes and ovaries when there are no signs of cancer). This includes women who have inherited certain changes in the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* gene or have an inherited syndrome.

It is very important to have a cancer risk
assessment and [counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before making this decision. These and other factors may be discussed:

- [Infertility](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46348&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Early menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=449953&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The drop in estrogen levels caused by removing the ovaries can cause early menopause. [Symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of menopause can worsen and include:

- [Hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Night sweats.
- Trouble sleeping.
- Mood changes.
- Decreased [sex drive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651212&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Heart disease.
- [Vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) dryness.
- Frequent urination.
- [Osteoporosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (decreased [bone density](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407755&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

These symptoms may not be the same in all women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be used to lessen these symptoms.
- Risk of ovarian cancer in the [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Women who have had a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy continue to have a small risk of ovarian cancer in the peritoneum (thin layer of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that lines the inside of the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). This is rare, but may occur if ovarian cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) had already spread to the peritoneum before the surgery or if some ovarian tissue remains after surgery.

### It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:

#### Diet

Studies of [dietary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) factors have not found a strong link to ovarian cancer.

#### Alcohol

Studies have not shown a link between drinking [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the risk of ovarian cancer.

#### Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Some studies of [aspirin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45176&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NSAIDs) have found a decreased risk of ovarian cancer and others have not.

#### Talc

Studies of women who used [talcum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=470254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) powder (talc) dusted on the [perineum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321384&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the area between the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the [anus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) have not found clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian cancer.

#### Infertility treatment

Overall, studies in women using fertility drugs have not found clear evidence of an increased
risk of ovarian cancer. The risk of invasive ovarian cancer may be higher in women who do not get [pregnant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after taking fertility drugs.

### Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.

Cancer prevention [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials include healthy people who may or may not have an increased risk of cancer. Other prevention trials include people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent recurrence or a second cancer.

The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or food [supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### New ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers prevention. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
