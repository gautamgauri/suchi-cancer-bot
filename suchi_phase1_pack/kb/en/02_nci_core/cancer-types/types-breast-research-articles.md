# Breast Cancer Research Results and Study Updates

See [Advances in Breast Cancer Research](/types/breast/research) for an overview of recent findings and progress, plus ongoing projects supported by NCI.

- [Some Women Avoid Breast Cancer Screening After False-Positive Mammogram Results](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/mammogram-false-positives-affect-future-screening)

Posted: October 4, 2024

Some women who receive a false-positive result on a mammogram may not come back for routine breast cancer screening in the future, a new study finds. Better doctor–patient communication about the screening process is needed, several researchers said.
- [Breast Cancer May Spread by Recruiting Nearby Sensory Nerves](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/breast-cancer-sensory-nerves-metastasis-genes)

Posted: September 20, 2024

A new study may provide important new insights into breast cancer metastasis. Blood vessels within tumors release a molecule that draws sensory nerves closer to the tumors, the study shows. This close proximity turns on genes in the cancer cells that drive metastasis.
- [How Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tools Work](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/understanding-breast-cancer-risk-assessment-tools)

Posted: June 27, 2024

Drs. Ruth Pfeiffer and Peter Kraft of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics discuss how breast cancer risk assessment tools are created and how people can use them to understand and manage their risk.
- [Can Some People with Breast Cancer Safely Skip Lymph Node Radiation?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/breast-cancer-skip-lymph-node-radiation)

Posted: January 23, 2024

Some people with no evidence of cancer in nearby lymph nodes after presurgical chemotherapy can skip radiation to that area without increasing the risk of the cancer returning, a clinical trial found. But some experts caution that more details are needed.
- [Study Adds to Debate about Mammography in Older Women](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/mammography-older-women-breast-cancer-overdiagnosis)

Posted: September 12, 2023

For women in their 70s and older, the risk of overdiagnosis with routine screening mammography is substantial, a new study suggests. The findings highlight the need for conversations between older women and their health care providers about the potential benefits and harms of continuing screening mammography.
- [Pausing Long-Term Breast Cancer Therapy to Become Pregnant Appears to Be Safe](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/pausing-breast-cancer-treatment-to-conceive)

Posted: January 20, 2023

Many young women who are diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer want to become pregnant in the future. New research suggests that these women may be able to pause their hormone therapy for up to 2 years as they try to get pregnant without raising the risk of a recurrence in the short term.
- [A Safer, Better Treatment Option for Some Younger Women with Breast Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/kisqali-hormone-therapy-breast-cancer)

Posted: January 11, 2023

For younger women with advanced breast cancer, the combination of ribociclib (Kisqali) and hormone therapy was much better at shrinking metastatic tumors than standard chemotherapy treatments, results from an NCI-funded clinical trial show.
- [Shorter Course of Radiation Is Effective, Safe for Some with Early-Stage Breast Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/early-breast-cancer-shorter-radiation-therapy)

Posted: November 30, 2022

In a large clinical trial, a condensed course of radiation therapy was as effective and safe as a longer standard course for those with higher-risk early-stage breast cancer who had a lumpectomy. This shorter radiation course makes treatment less of a burden for patients.
- [Pembrolizumab Improves Survival in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/pembrolizumab-triple-negative-breast-cancer-improves-survival)

Posted: August 9, 2022

Adding the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to chemotherapy can help some patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer live longer. In the KEYNOTE-355 trial, overall survival improved among patients whose tumors had high levels of the PD-L1 protein.
- [Enhertu Improves Survival for Metastatic “HER2-Low” Breast Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/enhertu-her2-low-breast-cancer)

Posted: July 5, 2022

People with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors had low levels of HER2 protein lived longer after treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) than those treated with standard chemotherapy, results of the DESTINY-Breast04 clinical trial show.
- [NCI Study Advances Personalized Immunotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer](/news-events/press-releases/2022/personalized-immunotherapy-metastatic-breast-cancer)

Posted: February 1, 2022

NCI researchers have shown that an experimental form of immunotherapy that uses an individual’s own tumor-fighting immune cells could potentially be used to treat people with metastatic breast cancer who have exhausted all other treatment options.
- [New Risk Model Aims to Reduce Breast Cancer Disparities in Black Women](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/breast-cancer-risk-calculator-us-black-women)

Posted: December 6, 2021

- [Breast Cancer Surgery Choice May Affect Young Survivors’ Quality of Life](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/breast-cancer-mastectomy-quality-of-life)

Posted: September 30, 2021

Women with early-stage breast cancer who had one or both breasts surgically removed (a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy) had lower scores on a quality-of-life survey than women who had breast-conserving surgery, a new study has found.
- [Physical Activity May Lessen the Effects of Chemo Brain, Study Finds](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/physical-activity-cognitive-function)

Posted: August 26, 2021

For women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, meeting the national physical activity guidelines may help alleviate cognitive issues, a new study suggests. The benefits may be even greater for patients who were physically active before treatment.
- [Sacituzumab Govitecan Earns Full Approval for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/sacituzumab-govitecan-tnbc-regular-approval)
