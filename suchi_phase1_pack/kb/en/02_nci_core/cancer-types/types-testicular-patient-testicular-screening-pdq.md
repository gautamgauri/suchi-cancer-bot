# Testicular Cancer Screening - NCI

# Testicular Cancer Screening (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Screening?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/testicular/hp/testicular-screening-pdq)

[Screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is looking for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before a person has any [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can help find cancer at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are trying to better understand which people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which [screening tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810044&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) should be used, and how often the tests should be done.

It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.

If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called [diagnostic tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45959&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## General Information About Testicular Cancer

### Key Points

- Testicular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.
- Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men aged 20 to 39 years.
- Testicular cancer can usually be cured.
- A condition called cryptorchidism (an undescended testicle) is a risk factor for testicular cancer.

### Testicular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.

The [testicles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are 2 egg-shaped [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) inside the [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a sac of loose skin that lies
directly below the [penis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The testicles are held within the scrotum by the [spermatic cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The spermatic cord also contains the [vas deferens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44309&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and vessels and [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the testicles.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/457830.jpg)![Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems; drawing shows front and side views of ureters, lymph nodes, rectum, bladder, prostate gland, vas deferens, urethra, penis, testicles, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/457830-750.jpg "Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems; drawing shows front and side views of ureters, lymph nodes, rectum, bladder, prostate gland, vas deferens, urethra, penis, testicles, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct.")

Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems, showing the testicles, prostate, bladder, and other organs.

The testicles are the male sex glands and make [testosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45581&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [sperm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Germ cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46382&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the testicles make immature sperm. These sperm travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and larger tubes into the [epididymis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615503&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a long coiled tube next to the testicles). This is where the sperm cells mature and are stored.

Almost all [testicular cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) start in the germ cells. The two main types of [testicular germ cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=695185&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [seminomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [nonseminomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men aged 20 to 39 years.

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 20 to 39 years, with the highest rates between ages 25 to 34 years. The racial and ethnic groups with the highest rates of testicular cancer include non-Hispanic White men, non-Hispanic American Indian men, and Alaska Native men.

### Testicular cancer can usually be cured.

Although the number of new cases of testicular cancer has doubled in the last 40 years,
the number of deaths caused by testicular cancer has decreased greatly because of better treatments. Testicular cancer can usually be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), even in [late stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561600&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. Learn more about testicular cancer at [Testicular Cancer Treatment](/types/testicular/patient/testicular-treatment-pdq).

### A condition called cryptorchidism (an undescended testicle) is a risk factor for testicular cancer.

Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop testicular cancer, and it will also develop in some people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.

Risk factors for testicular cancer include:

- having [cryptorchidism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46458&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- having a testicle that is not normal, such as a small testicle that does not work the way it should
- having testicular [carcinoma in situ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- being a White man
- having a [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of testicular cancer
- having [Klinefelter syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)

Men who have cryptorchidism, a testicle that is not normal, or testicular carcinoma in situ have an increased risk of testicular cancer in one or both testicles and need to be followed closely.

## Testicular Cancer Screening

### Key Points

- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- There is no standard or routine screening test for testicular cancer.
- Screening tests for testicular cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

### Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) study [screening tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810044&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of [recovery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is better if the disease is found and treated at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### There is no standard or routine screening test for testicular cancer.

There is no standard or routine screening test used for early detection of testicular cancer. Most often, testicular cancer is first found by men themselves, either by chance or during self-exam. Sometimes the cancer is found by a doctor during a routine [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

No studies have been done to find out if [testicular](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) self-exams, regular exams by a doctor, or other screening tests in men with no symptoms would decrease the risk of dying from this disease. However, routine screening probably would not decrease the risk of dying from testicular cancer. This is partly because testicular cancer can usually be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at any stage. Finding testicular cancer early may make it easier to treat. Patients who are [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with testicular cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body may need less [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and surgery, resulting in fewer [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

If a lump is found in the [testicle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by the patient or during a routine physical exam, tests may be done to check for cancer. Some tests have risks and may cause [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Screening tests for testicular cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about testicular cancer screening. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
