### Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.

**Paranasal sinuses**

"Paranasal" means near the nose. The [para sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=518299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are hollow, air-filled spaces in the bones around the nose. The sinuses are lined with [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that make [mucus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46274&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which keeps the inside of the nose from drying out during breathing.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/713969.jpg)![Anatomy of the paranasal sinuses; drawing shows front and side views of the frontal sinus, ethmoid sinus, maxillary sinus, and sphenoid sinus. The nasal cavity and pharynx (throat) are also shown.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/713969-750.jpg "Anatomy of the paranasal sinuses; drawing shows front and side views of the frontal sinus, ethmoid sinus, maxillary sinus, and sphenoid sinus. The nasal cavity and pharynx (throat) are also shown.")

Anatomy of the paranasal sinuses (spaces between the bones around the nose).

There are several para sinuses named after the bones that surround them:

- The [frontal sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are in the lower forehead above the nose.
- The [maxillary sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557102&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are in the cheekbones on either side of the nose.
- The [ethmoid sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557101&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are beside the upper nose, between the eyes.
- The [sphenoid sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are behind the nose, in the center of the [skull](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

**Nasal cavity**

The nose opens into the [nasal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=790106&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is divided into two nasal passages. Air moves through these passages during breathing. The nasal cavity lies above the bone that forms the roof of the mouth and curves down at the back to join the [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The area just inside the nostrils is called the nasal vestibule. A small area of special cells in the roof of each nasal passage sends signals to the brain to give the sense of smell.

Together the paranasal sinuses and the nasal cavity filter and warm the air, and make it moist before it goes into the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The movement of air through the sinuses and other parts of the [respiratory system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) help make sounds for talking.

[Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446532&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of [head and neck cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Different types of cells in the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity may become malignant.

The most common type of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer is [squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This type of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) forms in the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the paranasal sinuses and the nasal cavity.

Other types of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer include:

- [Melanomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Cancer that starts in cells called [melanocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cells that give skin its natural color.
- [Sarcomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45562&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Cancer that starts in muscle
or [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Inverting papillomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Benign tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that form inside the nose. A small number of these change into cancer.
- Midline granulomas: Cancer of [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the middle part of the face.

### Being exposed to certain chemicals or dust in the workplace can increase the risk of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.

Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer, and it will develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer include:

- Being exposed to certain workplace [chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or dust, such as those found in the following jobs:

- Furniture-making.
- Sawmill work.
- Woodworking (carpentry).
- Shoemaking.
- Metal-plating.
- Flour mill or bakery work.
- Being [infected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [human papillomavirus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HPV).
- Being male and older than 40 years.
- Smoking.

### Signs and symptoms of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer include sinus problems and nosebleeds.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by paranasal sinus and
nasal cavity cancer or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There may be no signs or symptoms in the early [stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Signs and symptoms may appear as the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grows. Check with your doctor if you have:

- Blocked sinuses that do not clear, or sinus pressure.
- Headaches or pain in the sinus areas.
- A runny nose.
- Nosebleeds.
- A lump or sore inside the nose that does not heal.
- A lump on the face or roof of the mouth.
- Numbness or tingling in the face.
- Swelling or other trouble with the eyes, such as double vision or the eyes pointing in different directions.
- Pain in the upper teeth, loose teeth, or dentures that no longer fit well.
- Pain or pressure in the ear.

### Tests that examine the sinuses and nasal cavity are used to diagnose paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.

In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **Physical exam of the nose, face, and neck**: An exam in
which the doctor looks into the nose with a small, long-handled mirror to check
for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas and checks the face and neck for lumps or swollen [lymph
nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[X-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the head and neck**: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **CT scan (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for signs of cancer. There are three types of biopsy:

- **[Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45691&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of tissue or [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) using a thin needle.
- **[Incisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46698&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of part of an area of tissue that doesn’t look normal.
- **[Excisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46411&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of an entire area of tissue that doesn’t look normal.
- **[Nasoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look inside the nose for abnormal areas. A [nasoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322869&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted into the nose. A nasoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. A special tool on the nasoscope may be used to remove samples of tissue. The tissues samples are viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.
- **[Laryngoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46321&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which the doctor checks the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (voice box) with a mirror or a [laryngoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46320&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for abnormal areas.
A laryngoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing the inside of the throat and voice box. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on:

- Where the tumor is in the paranasal sinus or nasal cavity and whether it has spread.
- The size of the tumor.
- The type of cancer.
- The patient's age and general
health.
- Whether the cancer has just been [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).

Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers often have spread by the time they are diagnosed and are hard to [cure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). After treatment, a
lifetime of frequent and careful [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is important because there is an increased risk of
developing a second kind of cancer in the head or neck.

## Stages of Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

### Key Points

- After paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer has been
diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the
paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity or to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- There is no standard staging system for cancer of the
sphenoid and frontal sinuses.
- The following stages are used for *maxillary sinus*
cancer:
- Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- The following stages are used for *nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus* cancer:
- Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- After surgery, the stage of the cancer may change and more treatment may be needed.
- Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [paranasal sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=518299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [nasal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=790106&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or
to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the staging
process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the
disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests
and procedures may be used in the staging process:

- **[Endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) inside the body to check for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas. An [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted through an opening in the body, such as the nose or mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) samples, which are checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of disease.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging) with [gadolinium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597153&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. Sometimes a substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (positron emission tomography scan)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
- **[Bone scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if nasal cavity cancer spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasal cavity cancer cells. The disease is metastatic nasal cavity cancer, not lung cancer.

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### There is no standard staging system for cancer of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses.

The staging described below for the [maxillary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557102&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [ethmoid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557101&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sinuses and the nasal cavity is only used for patients who have not had lymph nodes in the neck removed and checked for signs of cancer.

Also shown is a 10-cm ruler and a 4-inch ruler.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415526-750.jpg "Drawing shows different sizes of a tumor in centimeters (cm) compared to the size of a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm). Also shown is a 10-cm ruler and a 4-inch ruler.")

Tumor sizes are often measured in centimeters (cm) or inches. Common food items that can be used to show tumor size in cm include: a pea (1 cm), a peanut (2 cm), a grape (3 cm), a walnut (4 cm), a lime (5 cm or 2 inches), an egg (6 cm), a peach (7 cm), and a grapefruit (10 cm or 4 inches).

### The following stages are used for *maxillary sinus* cancer:

#### Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)

In [stage 0](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450129&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in the [mucous membranes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257212&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lining the [maxillary sinus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=557102&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These abnormal cells may become [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and spread into nearby normal [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage 0 is also called [carcinoma in situ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Stage I

### After surgery, the stage of the cancer may change and more treatment may be needed.

If the cancer is removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) will examine a sample of the cancer tissue under a microscope. Sometimes, the pathologist’s review results in a change to the stage of the cancer and more treatment is needed after surgery.

### Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may come back in the [paranasal sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=518299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [nasal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=790106&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
or in other parts of the body.

cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer.
- The following types of treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
trials.
- Treatment for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with
[paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446532&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently
used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment
clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or
obtain information on new treatments for patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical
trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### Patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer.

Treatment will be overseen by a [medical oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46290&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. The medical oncologist works with other doctors who are experts in treating patients with [head and neck cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and who specialize in certain areas of [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [rehabilitation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441257&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Patients who have paranasal sinus and nasal
cavity cancer may need special help
adjusting to breathing problems or other [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer and its treatment. If a large amount of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or bone around the [paranasal sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=518299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [nasal cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=790106&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is taken out, [plastic surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269468&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done to repair or rebuild the area. The treatment team may include the following [specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Radiation oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46546&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Neurologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Oral surgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46249&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or head and neck [surgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44306&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Plastic surgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Dentist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=389460&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Nutritionist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44662&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Speech](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43973&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and language pathologist.
- [Rehabilitation specialist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318825&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common
treatment for all [stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer and
some of the healthy tissue and bone around the cancer. If the cancer
has spread, the doctor may remove
[lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other tissues in the
neck.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
time of the surgery, some patients may be given [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after surgery to kill any cancer
[cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are left. Treatment given
after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
[adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:

- [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. The total [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of radiation therapy is sometimes divided into several smaller, equal doses delivered over a period of several days.
This is called [fractionation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46392&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/732667.jpg)![External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table under a machine that is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. An inset shows a mesh mask that helps keep the patient's head and neck from moving during treatment. The mask has pieces of white tape with small ink marks on it. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/732667-750.jpg "External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table under a machine that is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. An inset shows a mesh mask that helps keep the patient's head and neck from moving during treatment. The mask has pieces of white tape with small ink marks on it. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.")

External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck. A machine is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. The machine can rotate around the patient, delivering radiation from many different angles to provide highly conformal treatment. A mesh mask helps keep the patient’s head and neck from moving during treatment. Small ink marks are put on the mask. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.
- [Internal radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substance sealed in needles, [seeds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), wires, or [catheters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are placed directly into or near the cancer.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.

External radiation therapy to the [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44751&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may change the way the thyroid
gland works. The [thyroid hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44558&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels in the blood may be tested before and after
treatment.

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body cavity such as the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Combination chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.

The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/head-neck "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/head-neck"). (Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about clinical trials is available from the
[NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").
