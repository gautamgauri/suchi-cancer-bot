## Overview

Soft tissue sarcoma is a broad term for cancers that start in soft tissues (muscle, tendons, fat, lymph and blood vessels, and nerves). These cancers can develop anywhere in the body but are found mostly in the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen. Explore the links on this page to learn more about different types of soft tissue sarcoma and how they are treated. We also have information about research and clinical trials.
