# Liver and Bile Duct Cancer Research Results and Study Updates

See [Advances in Liver Cancer Research](/types/liver/research) for an overview of recent findings and progress, plus ongoing projects supported by NCI.

- [TACE-Based Treatment Combinations Effective Against Intermediate-Stage Liver Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2025/liver-cancer-tace-plus-targeted-and-immunotherapy)

Posted: March 7, 2025

Results from two clinical trials show that combining a procedure called TACE with an immunotherapy drug and angiogenesis inhibitor improves how long people with intermediate-stage liver cancer live without their disease returning or getting worse.
- [Can the New “Omics” on the Block Find Liver Cancer in Blood?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/liver-cancer-liquid-biopsy-fragmentomics)

Posted: May 15, 2023

Researchers have developed a blood test that, in a preliminary study, accurately detected liver cancer, including in people with early-stage disease. The test uses a new type of technology called fragmentomics to analyze bits of DNA in the blood.
- [Study Tackles Key Questions about Liver Transplants for People with Liver Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/liver-transplant-liver-cancer-downstaging)

Posted: August 24, 2022

For some people with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, a liver transplant is the only hope for a cure. A new study shows a high 10-year survival rate for people who got a liver transplant after their tumors were “downstaged” to become eligible for a transplant.
- [Durvalumab Modestly Improves Survival in Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/biliary-tract-cancer-durvalumab-improves-survival)

Posted: February 10, 2022

Adding durvalumab (Imfinzi) to standard chemotherapy modestly extended how long people with advanced biliary tract cancer lived, results from the TOPAZ-1 trial show. The immunotherapy drug may now be the standard first-line therapy for this hard-to-treat cancer.
- [Study Identifies Potential Drug Target to Prevent Some Liver Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/spectrin-fatty-liver-disease-liver-cancer)

Posted: February 4, 2022

Researchers have found that mice that lack β2-spectrin protein in their livers are protected from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the most common kind of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma.
- [NIH scientists develop blood test to help improve liver cancer screening](/news-events/press-releases/2020/liver-cancer-screening-test)

Posted: June 11, 2020

The new test is relatively simple and could improve screening for people who are at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. It could help doctors find and treat HCC early.
- [Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab Approved to Treat Liver Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/fda-atezolizumab-bevacizumab-liver-cancer)

Posted: June 4, 2020

FDA has approved atezolizumab (Tecentriq) plus bevacizumab (Avastin) as an initial treatment for some people with advanced liver cancer. This is the first approval in 13 years for a treatment that is more effective than the current standard, sorafenib.
- [Some Children with Liver Cancer May Need Less Chemotherapy, Study Suggests](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/liver-cancer-hepatoblastoma-less-chemotherapy)

Posted: May 9, 2019

Some children with liver cancer may need less chemotherapy than is typically used, new research suggests. The study included children and infants with hepatoblastoma whose tumors had been surgically removed when the disease was diagnosed.
- [Curbing Production of Immune Checkpoint Protein Slows Liver Cancer in Mice](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/translation-inhibitor-immune-checkpoint-protein)

Posted: February 6, 2019

Researchers have found an unconventional way to unleash the immune system against liver cancer in mice. The researchers used an investigational drug to curb the production of a checkpoint inhibitor protein that shields tumors from the immune system.
- [Targeted Treatment for Rare Digestive Tract Cancers May Extend Survival](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/biliary-tract-cancer-dabrafenib-trametinib)

Posted: December 7, 2018

In an early-phase trial, dabrafenib plus trametinib shrank tumors in patients with biliary tract cancer and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine whose tumors had a specific mutation in the BRAF gene.
- [NCI study finds gut microbiome can control antitumor immune function in liver](/news-events/press-releases/2018/gut-microbiome-liver-cancer)

Posted: May 24, 2018

An NCI study in mice that found a connection between gut bacteria and antitumor immune responses in the liver has implications for understanding mechanisms that lead to liver cancer and for potential treatments. The study was published in Science.
- [Nivolumab Receives Accelerated Approval from FDA for Advanced Liver Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/opdivo-fda-liver)

Posted: October 20, 2017

The FDA has granted accelerated approval to the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (Opdivo®) for patients with advanced liver cancer who have previously been treated with the targeted therapy sorafenib (Nexavar®).
- [TCGA study of liver cancer reveals potential targets for therapy](/news-events/press-releases/2017/tcga-liver-study)

Posted: June 15, 2017

Only two drugs are FDA-approved for liver cancer. This study of hepatocellular carcinoma found genetic alterations in tumors—including mutations in tumor-suppressing genes and high expression of immune checkpoint genes—that could be targets for drugs that already exist.
- [Regorafenib Becomes First FDA-Approved Drug for Liver Cancer in Nearly a Decade](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/fda-regorafenib-liver)

Posted: May 24, 2017

FDA approved the kinase inhibitor regorafenib for some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer.
