# Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Screening?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-screening-pdq)

[Screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is looking for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before a person has any [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can help find
cancer at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or cancer is found early, it may
be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun
to spread.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are trying to better understand which
people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things
we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This
information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which
screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.

It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily
think you have cancer if he or she suggests a [screening test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810044&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Screening
tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.

If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called [diagnostic tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689569&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers

### Key Points

- Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells
form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
- In the United States, ovarian cancer is the sixth-leading cause of death from cancer in women.
- Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

### Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.

The [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are a pair
of organs in the female [reproductive
system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They are in the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), one on each side of the
uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped
organ where a [fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grows). Each
ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and
female [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
control the way certain cells or
organs work in the body).

The [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.

The [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the tissue that lines the [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) wall and covers organs in the abdomen. [Primary peritoneal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.

[Ovarian epithelial cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46768&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fallopian tube cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=755773&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue. Studies of screening tests look at these cancers together.

### In the United States, ovarian cancer is the sixth-leading cause of death from cancer in women.

Although ovarian cancer is rare, it is the sixth-leading cause of death from cancer in women. It is also the leading cause of death from cancer of the female reproductive system. The number of new cases of ovarian cancer have been decreasing slightly each year since at least the 1970s. There was also a slight decrease in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2004 to 2022.

### Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease
is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a [protective factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for ovarian cancer.

## Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening

### Key Points

- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- Screening for ovarian cancer may not help a person live longer.
- Screening tests that have been studied include:
- Pelvic exam
- Transvaginal ultrasound
- CA-125 blood test
- Screening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.

### Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.

[Scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) study [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests to find those with the fewest harms and most benefits. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of [recovery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is better if the disease is found and treated at an early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Screening for ovarian cancer may not help a person live longer.

### Screening tests that have been studied include:

#### Pelvic exam

[Pelvic exams](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to screen for ovarian cancer have not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. A pelvic exam is an exam of the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [speculum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted into the vagina, and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two [lubricated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924.jpg)![Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam. The uterus, left fallopian tube, left ovary, cervix, vagina, bladder, and rectum are shown. Two gloved fingers of one hand of the doctor or nurse are shown inserted into the vagina, while the other hand is shown pressing on the lower abdomen. The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924-750.jpg "Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam.

The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.")

Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.

#### Transvaginal ultrasound

[Transvaginal ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46633&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TVU) to screen for ovarian cancer has not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. TVU is a procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An [ultrasound transducer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367430&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves off internal tissues or organs in the pelvis. These sound waves make echoes that form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618018.jpg)![Transvaginal ultrasound; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a transvaginal ultrasound procedure. An ultrasound probe (a device that makes sound waves that bounce off tissues inside the body) is shown inserted into the vagina. The bladder, uterus, right fallopian tube, and right ovary are also shown. The inset shows the diagnostic sonographer (a person trained to perform ultrasound procedures) examining a woman on a table, and a computer screen shows an image of the patient’s internal tissues.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618018-750.jpg "Transvaginal ultrasound; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a transvaginal ultrasound procedure.

The bladder, uterus, right fallopian tube, and right ovary are also shown. The inset shows the diagnostic sonographer (a person trained to perform ultrasound procedures) examining a woman on a table, and a computer screen shows an image of the patient’s internal tissues.")

Transvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).

#### CA-125 blood test

A [CA-125](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46490&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [blood test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) measures the level of CA-125, a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA-125 level may be a sign of certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, or other conditions.

Studies have also shown that using CA-125 levels and TVU together to screen for ovarian cancer does not decrease the number of deaths from ovarian cancer.

### Screening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

## Risks of Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Screening

### Key Points

- Screening tests have risks.
- The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers screening tests include:
- Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live
longer.
- False-negative test results can occur.
- False-positive test results can occur.

### Screening tests have risks.

Decisions about [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful, and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may
want to talk about the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of
the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from
cancer.

### The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers screening tests include:

#### Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers may not improve health or help a woman live longer.

Screening
may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [ovarian cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445074&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or if it has already spread to
other places in your body.

#### False-negative test results can occur.

Screening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is
present. A woman who receives a [false-negative test result](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (one that
shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.

#### False-positive test results can occur.

Screening test results may appear to be [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) even though no
cancer is present. A [false-positive test result](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is usually followed by more tests and procedures (such as
a [laparoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a [laparotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ovarian cancer include [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), blood loss, [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injury, and heart and [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded oophorectomy (removal of one or both [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers screening. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
