# Esophageal Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Prevention?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/esophageal/hp/esophageal-prevention-pdq)

Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting
cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer
in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower
the number of deaths caused by cancer.

To prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at [risk
factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that increases your
chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor;
anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is
called a cancer protective factor.

Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot.
For example, both smoking and inheriting certain [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are
risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be
avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be protective
factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and
increasing protective factors may lower your risk, but it does
not mean that you will not get cancer.

Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied.

## General Information About Esophageal Cancer

### Key Points

- Esophageal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
cells form in the tissues of the esophagus.
- Esophageal cancer is found more often in men.

### Esophageal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the esophagus.

The [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the hollow, muscular tube that moves food and
liquid from the [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The wall of the esophagus is made up of several tissue layers,
including [mucous membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257212&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), muscle, and [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Esophageal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444989&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
starts in the inner lining of the esophagus and spreads outward through the
other layers as it grows.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/428446.jpg)![Gastrointestinal (digestive) system anatomy; drawing shows the esophagus, liver, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/428446-750.jpg "Gastrointestinal (digestive) system anatomy; drawing shows the esophagus, liver, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.")

The esophagus and stomach are part of the upper gastrointestinal (digestive) system.

The two most common types of esophageal cancer are named for the
type of [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that become cancerous:

- [Squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Cancer forms in the thin, flat cells lining the inside of the esophagus. This cancer is most often found
in the upper and middle part of the esophagus but can occur anywhere along the esophagus. This is also called epidermoid
carcinoma.
- [Adenocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Cancer begins in
glandular cells.
Glandular cells in the lining of the esophagus produce and release fluids such
as [mucus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46274&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Adenocarcinoma usually forms in the lower part of the esophagus, near
the stomach.

Other [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summaries containing information related to esophageal cancer include:

- [Esophageal Cancer Screening](/types/esophageal/patient/esophageal-screening-pdq)
- [Esophageal Cancer Treatment](/types/esophageal/patient/esophageal-treatment-pdq)

### Esophageal cancer is found more often in men.

Rates of esophageal cancer cases and deaths have decreased slightly over recent years. Men are about four times more likely than women to develop esophageal cancer. The chance of developing this disease increases with age in all racial and ethnic groups. White men are more likely to develop esophageal cancer and have higher death rates from it than Black men across all age groups. Black women are more likely to develop esophageal cancer until age 74 years, after which White women have a higher risk. Black women have higher death rates from this disease until age 69 years, after which White women have higher death rates.

In the United States, rates of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus rose rapidly through the 1990s, overtaking rates of squamous cell carcinoma. Although the rates of squamous cell carcinoma are declining overall, they remain much higher among Black men than White men, while adenocarcinoma rates are higher among White men.

### Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.

Avoiding [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having [overweight](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and not getting enough exercise. Increasing [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.

The risk factors and protective factors for [squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [adenocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the esophagus are not the same.

### The following *risk* factors increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus:

#### Smoking and alcohol use

Studies have shown that the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is increased in people who smoke or drink a lot.

### The following *protective* factors may decrease the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus:

#### Avoiding tobacco and alcohol use

Studies have shown that the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is lower in people who do not use [tobacco](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439432&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

[Chemoprevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45487&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the use of drugs, [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or other substances to help lower a person's risk of developing cancer. [Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NSAIDs) include [aspirin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45176&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other drugs that reduce swelling and pain.

Some studies have shown that the use of NSAIDs
may lower the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. However, the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, [stroke](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439425&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), bleeding in the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) damage.

### The following *risk* factors increase the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus:

#### Gastric reflux

Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is strongly linked to [gastroesophageal reflux](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257517&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease (GERD), especially when the GERD lasts a long time and severe [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occur daily. GERD is a condition in which the contents of the stomach, including [stomach acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657842&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), flow up into the lower part of the esophagus. This irritates the inside of the esophagus, and over time, may affect the cells lining the lower part of the esophagus. This condition is called [Barrett esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Over time, the affected cells are replaced with [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells, which may later become adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. [Obesity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in combination with GERD may further increase the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

The use of medicines that relax the lower [sphincter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257222&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) muscle of the esophagus may increase the likelihood of developing GERD. When the lower sphincter muscle is relaxed, stomach acid may flow up into the lower part of the esophagus.

It is not known if surgery or other medical treatment to stop [gastric reflux](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390280&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lowers the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. [Clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are being done to see if surgery or medical treatments can prevent Barrett esophagus.

### The following *protective* factors may decrease the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus:

#### Chemoprevention with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other substances to help lower a person's risk of developing cancer. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin and other drugs that reduce swelling and pain.

Some studies have shown that the use of NSAIDs
may lower the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. However, the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, bleeding in the stomach and intestines, and kidney damage.

#### Radiofrequency ablation of the esophagus

Patients with Barrett esophagus who have abnormal cells in the lower esophagus may be treated with [radiofrequency ablation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44865&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This procedure uses [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to heat and destroy abnormal cells, which may become cancer. Risks of using radiofrequency ablation include narrowing of the esophagus and bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines.

One study of patients who have Barrett esophagus and abnormal cells in the esophagus compared patients who received radiofrequency ablation with patients who did not. Patients who received radiofrequency ablation were less likely to be diagnosed with [esophageal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444989&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). More studies are needed to know whether radiofrequency ablation decreases the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in patients with these conditions.

### Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.

Cancer prevention [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials include healthy people who may or may not have an increased risk of cancer. Other prevention trials include people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent recurrence or a second cancer.

The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or food [supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### New ways to prevent esophageal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about esophageal cancer prevention. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
