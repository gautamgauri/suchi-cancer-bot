## Overview

Urethral cancer is rare and is more common in men than in women. Urethral cancer can metastasize (spread) quickly to tissues around the urethra and has often spread to nearby lymph nodes by the time it is diagnosed. Explore the links on this page to learn more about urethral cancer treatment and clinical trials.
