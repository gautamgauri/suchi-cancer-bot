### Key Points

- Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in
the outer layer of the adrenal gland.
- Having a certain mutation (change) in the TP53 gene increases the risk of adrenocortical carcinoma.
- Signs and symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include a lump or pain in the abdomen.
- Tests that examine the adrenal glands are used to diagnose and stage adrenocortical carcinoma.
- Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).

### Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the outer layer of the adrenal gland.

There are two [adrenal glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The adrenal glands are small and shaped like a triangle. One adrenal gland sits on top of each [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Each adrenal gland has two parts. The outer layer of the adrenal gland is the [adrenal cortex](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458082&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The center of the adrenal gland is the [adrenal medulla](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Adrenocortical carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446526&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is also called adrenocortical cancer or cancer of the adrenal cortex.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/805084.jpg)![Anatomy of the adrenal gland; drawing of the abdomen showing the left and right adrenal glands, the left and right kidneys, and major blood vessels. Also shown is an inset of an adrenal gland showing the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/805084-750.jpg "Anatomy of the adrenal gland; drawing of the abdomen showing the left and right adrenal glands, the left and right kidneys, and major blood vessels. Also shown is an inset of an adrenal gland showing the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla.")

Anatomy of the adrenal gland. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. The outer part of each gland is the adrenal cortex and the inner part is the adrenal medulla.

The adrenal cortex makes important [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that:

- Balance the water and salt in the body.
- Help keep [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) normal.
- Help control the body's use of [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fat, and [carbohydrates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Cause the body to have male or female characteristics.

The adrenal medulla makes hormones that help the body react to [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that forms in the adrenal medulla is called [pheochromocytoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322877&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is not discussed in this summary. See the PDQ summary on [Childhood Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Treatment](/types/pheochromocytoma/patient/child-pheochromocytoma-treatment-pdq) for more information.

Most childhood [adrenocortical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occur during the first 5 years of life, but they may also occur during adolescence.

### Having a certain mutation (change) in the TP53 gene increases the risk of adrenocortical carcinoma.

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.

The risk of adrenocortical carcinoma is increased by having a [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (change) in the *TP53* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or any of the following [syndromes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Li-Fraumeni syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46322&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304689&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hemihyperplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=785255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Signs and symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma include a lump or pain in the abdomen.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by adrenocortical carcinoma or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:

- Pain in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or back.
- A lump in the abdomen.
- Feeling of fullness in the abdomen.
- [High blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458091&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Acne](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44183&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Growing body hair.
- Deepening of the voice.
- Growing faster than normal.

Also, cancer of the adrenal cortex may be [functioning](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458094&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (makes more hormones than normal) or [nonfunctioning](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (does not make extra hormones). Most tumors of the adrenal cortex in children are functioning tumors. The extra hormones made by functioning tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease and these depend on the type of hormone made by the tumor.
For example, extra [androgen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45592&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hormone may also cause male children to develop an enlarged [penis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257215&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and female children to develop enlarged genitalia. Extra [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hormone may cause the growth of [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in male children. Extra [cortisol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597113&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hormone may cause (hypercortisolism).

See the PDQ summary onAdrenocortical Carcinoma Treatment (Adult) for more information on the signs and symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma.

### Tests that examine the adrenal glands are used to diagnose and stage adrenocortical carcinoma.

Tests are done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer. After cancer is diagnosed, more tests are done to find out if cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body. This process is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is important to know whether cancer has spread in order to plan the best treatment.

The following tests and procedures may be used:

- **[Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
- **[X-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An x-ray of the chest, abdomen, or bones inside the body. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775531.jpg)![Computed tomography (CT) scan; drawing shows a child lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775531-750.jpg "Computed tomography (CT) scan; drawing shows a child lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.")

Computed tomography (CT) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of areas inside the body.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the chest and abdomen. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775532.jpg)![Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; drawing shows a child lying on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775532-750.jpg "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; drawing shows a child lying on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.")

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The child lies on a table that slides into the MRI machine, which takes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The positioning of the child on the table depends on the part of the body being imaged.
- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775456.jpg)![Positron emission tomography (PET) scan; drawing shows a child lying on table that slides through the PET scanner.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775456-750.jpg "Positron emission tomography (PET) scan; drawing shows a child lying on table that slides through the PET scanner.")

Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body. Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.
- **[Ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam**: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The picture can be printed to be looked at later.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775457.jpg)![Abdominal ultrasound; drawing shows a child lying on an exam table during an abdominal ultrasound procedure. A technician is shown pressing a transducer (a device that makes sound waves that bounce off tissues inside the body) against the skin of the abdomen. A computer screen shows a sonogram (picture).](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/775457-750.jpg "Abdominal ultrasound; drawing shows a child lying on an exam table during an abdominal ultrasound procedure. A technician is shown pressing a transducer (a device that makes sound waves that bounce off tissues inside the body) against the skin of the abdomen. A computer screen shows a sonogram (picture).")

Abdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound transducer connected to a computer is pressed against the skin of the abdomen. The transducer bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).
- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cells or tissues during [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) so they can be viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for signs of cancer.
- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- **Blood hormone studies**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. The blood may be checked for [testosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45581&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or estrogen. A higher than normal amount of these hormones may be a sign of adrenocortical carcinoma.
- **Twenty-four-hour [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) test**: A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of cortisol or 17-ketosteroids. A higher than normal amount of these substances in the urine may be a sign of disease in the adrenal cortex.
- **Low-[dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [dexamethasone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45262&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) suppression test**: A test in which one or more small doses of dexamethasone are given. The level of cortisol is checked from a sample of blood or from urine that is collected for three days. This test is done to check if the adrenal gland is making too much cortisol.
- **High-dose dexamethasone suppression test**: A test in which one or more high doses of dexamethasone are given. The level of cortisol is checked from a sample of blood or from urine that is collected for three days. This test is done to check if the adrenal gland is making too much cortisol or if the [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is telling the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol.
- **Adrenal [angiography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46531&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at the [arteries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the flow of blood near the adrenal gland. A [contrast dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is injected into the adrenal arteries. As the dye moves through the [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a series of x-rays are taken to see if any arteries are blocked.
- **Adrenal [venography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at the adrenal veins and the flow of blood near the adrenal glands. A contrast dye is injected into an adrenal vein. As the contrast dye moves through the vein, a series of x-rays are taken to see if any veins are blocked. A [catheter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (very thin tube) may be inserted into the vein to take a blood sample, which is checked for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hormone levels.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is good for patients who have small tumors that have been completely removed by surgery. For other patients, the prognosis depends on the following:

- The size of the tumor.
- How quickly the cancer is growing.
- Whether there are changes in certain genes.
- Whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body, including the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), kidney, or bone.
- The child's age.
- Whether the covering around the tumor broke open during surgery to remove the tumor.
- Whether the tumor was completely removed during surgery.
- Whether the child has developed masculine traits.

## Stages of Adrenocortical Carcinoma

### Key Points

- After adrenocortical carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

### After adrenocortical carcinoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread to [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the [adrenal glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the staging process is used to plan treatment. The results of the [tests and procedures](/types/adrenocortical/patient/child-adrenocortical-treatment-pdq#_225) used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer are often also used to [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the disease.

Sometimes childhood [adrenocortical carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446526&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) recurs (comes back) in the [adrenal cortex](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458082&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or in other parts of the body after it has been treated.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the same type of cancer as the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For example, if adrenocortical carcinoma spreads to the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the liver are actually adrenocortical carcinoma cells. The disease is metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma, not [liver cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44242&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for children with adrenocortical carcinoma.
- Children with adrenocortical carcinoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
- Two types of standard treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Immunotherapy
- Treatment for childhood adrenocortical carcinoma may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for children with adrenocortical carcinoma.

Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.

Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### Children with adrenocortical carcinoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.

Treatment will be overseen by a [pediatric oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=693555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating children with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The pediatric oncologist works with other [pediatric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Two types of standard treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the main treatment for [adrenocortical carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446526&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Chemotherapy

[Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

#### Immunotherapy

[Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient’s [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of [biologic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45617&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- [Immune checkpoint inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=772606&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy is a type of immunotherapy that blocks certain [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [PD-1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=777027&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a protein on the surface of [T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that helps keep the body’s [immune responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in check. [PD-L1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797389&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells. [Pembrolizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=764538&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a PD-1 inhibitor that is being studied in the treatment of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma that is [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or has come back after treatment.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).

Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.

### Treatment for childhood adrenocortical carcinoma may cause side effects.

To learn more about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that begin during treatment for cancer, visit [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects").

Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called [late effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:

- Physical problems, including problems with the [thyroid gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44751&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), hearing, fully opening the mouth, dental [cavities](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [chronic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [sinusitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799139&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or ear [infections](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
- [Second cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (new types of cancer) or other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. See the PDQ summary on [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-pdq). for more information.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood adrenocortical carcinoma. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
