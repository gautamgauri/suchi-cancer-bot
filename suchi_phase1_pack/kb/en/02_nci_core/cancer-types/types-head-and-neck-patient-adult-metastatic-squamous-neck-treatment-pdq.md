### Key Points

- Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a
disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to
lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
- Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.
- Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract, and upper part of the digestive tract are used
to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the
primary tumor.
- Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

### Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.

Squamous cells are thin, flat cells found in tissues that form the surface of the skin and the lining of body cavities such as the mouth, hollow organs such as the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the lining of the [respiratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44490&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (breathing) and [digestive tracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some organs with squamous cells are the [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [kidneys](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and uterus. [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can begin in squamous cells anywhere in the
body and [metastasize](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46283&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (spread) through the blood or [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

When [squamous cell cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) spreads to [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the neck or around the
[collarbone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=639993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), it is called [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the cancer that first formed in the body), because
treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the
primary tumor.
For example, when [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) spreads to the neck, the cancer cells in the neck are lung cancer cells and they are
treated the same as the cancer in the lung. Sometimes doctors cannot find where in the body the cancer first began to grow. When tests cannot find a primary tumor, it is called an
[occult (hidden) primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In many cases, the primary tumor is never found.

### Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.

Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or
[throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that doesn't go away. These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by
metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms.

### Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract, and upper part of the digestive tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the primary tumor.

Tests will include checking for a primary tumor in the organs and tissues of the respiratory tract (part of the [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), the upper part of the digestive tract (including the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat, [vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and part of the esophagus), and the [genitourinary system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46381&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or tested in the laboratory to check for signs of cancer.

Three types of biopsy may be done:

- **[Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45691&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of tissue or [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) using a thin needle.
- **[Core needle biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641799&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of tissue using a wide needle.
- **[Excisional biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46411&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of an entire lump of tissue.

The following procedures are used to remove samples of cells or tissue:

- **Tonsillectomy**: Surgery to remove both [tonsils](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46618&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas. An [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted through an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth or nose. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. The nose, throat, back of the tongue, esophagus, stomach, [voice box](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=520366&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [windpipe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44379&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and large airways will be checked.

One or more of the following [laboratory tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done to study the tissue samples:

- **[Immunohistochemistry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653117&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A laboratory test that uses [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for certain [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in a sample of a patient’s blood or [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The antibodies are usually linked to an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the blood or bone marrow, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
- **[Light](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44052&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [electron microscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44025&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.
- **[Epstein-Barr virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (EBV) and [human papillomavirus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HPV) test**: A test that checks the cells in a sample of tissue for EBV and HPV [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/753850.jpg)![Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/753850-750.jpg "Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.")

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (positron emission tomography scan)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A whole body PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time to look for where the cancer first formed. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.

A diagnosis of occult primary tumor is made if the primary tumor is not found during testing or treatment.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on:

- The number and size of lymph nodes that have cancer in them.
- Whether the cancer has [responded](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treatment or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).
- How different from normal the cancer cells look under a microscope.
- The patient's age and general health.

Treatment options also depend on:

- Which part of the neck the cancer is in.
- Whether certain tumor markers are found.

## Stages of Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary

### Key Points

- After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is no standard [staging
system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for metastatic squamous neck cancer with [occult primary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Depending on whether the cancer was caused by [human papillomavirus 16](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=811775&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [Epstein-Barr virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cancer staging may be used. To learn more, visit the section called [Stage Information for Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/metastatic-squamous-neck-treatment-pdq#_16) in the health professional version of this page.

The results from [tests and procedures](/types/head-and-neck/patient/adult/metastatic-squamous-neck-treatment-pdq#_8) used to detect and [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are also used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back in the neck or in other parts of the body.

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for patients with
metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.
- The following types of treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Chemotherapy
- Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
- Treatment for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
primary may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up care may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with
metastatic squamous neck [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [occult primary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are
[standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
[clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A
treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current
treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.
When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

Surgery may include [neck dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46281&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There are different types of neck dissection, based on the amount of tissue that is removed.

- Radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove tissues in one or both sides of the neck between the jawbone and the [collarbone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=639993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including:

- All [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- The jugular [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Muscles and [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are used for face, neck, and shoulder movement, speech, and swallowing.

The patient may need [physical therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the throat, neck, shoulder, and/or arm after radical neck dissection. Radical neck dissection may be used when cancer has spread widely in the neck.
- Modified radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in one or both sides of the neck without removing the neck muscles. The nerves and/or the jugular vein may be removed.
- Partial neck dissection: Surgery to remove some of the lymph nodes in the neck.
This is also called selective neck dissection.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
time of surgery, some patients may be given [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment
given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant
therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. [Intensity-modulated radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335073&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (IMRT) is a type of [3-dimensional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and damage to the skin.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/732667.jpg)![External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table under a machine that is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. An inset shows a mesh mask that helps keep the patient's head and neck from moving during treatment. The mask has pieces of white tape with small ink marks on it. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/732667-750.jpg "External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table under a machine that is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer.

The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.")

External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck. A machine is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. The machine can rotate around the patient, delivering radiation from many different angles to provide highly conformal treatment. A mesh mask helps keep the patient’s head and neck from moving during treatment. Small ink marks are put on the mask. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.

Radiation therapy to the neck may change the way the [thyroid gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44751&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) works. [Blood tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be done to check the [thyroid hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44558&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level in the body
before treatment and at regular checkups after treatment.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

#### Chemotherapy

[Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

#### Hyperfractionated radiation therapy

[Hyperfractionated radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=484407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.

### Treatment for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up care may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
