- [Will This Cancer Metastasize? Check Its “Stickiness”](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2025/tumor-cell-adhesion-predict-metastasis)

Posted: May 6, 2025

A device that measures the “stickiness” of cancer cells in tumor samples may help predict the likelihood of a patient’s cancer metastasizing. Researchers believe the device could eventually help doctors make more informed treatment choices.
- [Jaw Problems Linked to Bone-Modifying Drugs Not as Rare as Once Thought](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/breast-cancer-jaw-osteonecrosis-antiresorptive)

Posted: September 26, 2024

Osteonecrosis of the jaw was thought to be a rare side effect of drugs like denosumab (Xgeva) that lessen bone problems when cancer has spread to the bone. But a new study has found that the painful side effect is more common than once thought.
- [Dabrafenib–Trametinib Combination Approved for Solid Tumors with BRAF Mutations](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/fda-dabrafenib-trametinib-braf-solid-tumors)

Posted: July 21, 2022

FDA has approved the combination of the targeted drugs dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) for nearly any type of advanced solid tumor with a specific mutation in the BRAF gene. Data from the NCI-MATCH trial informed the approval.
- [Cancer in Lymph Nodes May Help Tumors Spread by Enlisting Immune Cells](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/cancer-lymph-nodes-metastasis)

Posted: May 27, 2022

Cancer often spreads to the lymph nodes, but it has never been clear why. A new study in mice suggests lymph node invasion helps the primary tumor spread, or metastasize, to other organs.
- [From Scan to Scan: The Challenges of Living with Metastatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/living-with-metastatic-cancer)

Posted: October 15, 2021

New treatments are helping more people with advanced or metastatic cancer live longer. At a recent NCI conference, survivors and researchers came together to discuss how to better address the needs of those living with metastatic cancer.
- [Engineered immune cells deliver anticancer signal, prevent cancer from spreading](/news-events/press-releases/2021/engineered-myeloid-cells-prevent-cancer-spread)

Posted: March 24, 2021

In an NCI study, treating mice with engineered immune cells shrank tumors and prevented the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body. The immunotherapy approach shows promise as a potential treatment for metastatic cancer.
- [Study Explores Jaw Problem Linked to Zoledronic Acid, Finds Risk Factors](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/jaw-osteonecrosis-zoledronic-acid)

Posted: January 28, 2021

A recent study quantified the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw for patients who take zoledronic acid to manage complications from cancer that has spread to the bone. The study also examined risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw in these patients.
- [Targeted Radiation Reduces Pain from Cancer Metastases in the Spine](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/radiation-sbrt-painful-spinal-metastases)

Posted: November 24, 2020

For some patients with painful spinal metastases from advanced cancer, a type of precise, high-dose radiation therapy—called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)—may be a highly effective way to relieve that pain, clinical trial results show.
- [A More Treatable Kind of Metastatic Cancer?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/oligometastatic-cancer-directly-treating-cancer-metastases)

Posted: October 5, 2020

People with oligometastatic cancer have only a few metastatic tumors. Researchers are studying whether treating these individual tumors directly with surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBTR or SABR) can help patients live longer or improve their quality of life.
- [Melanoma Cells Are More Likely to Spread after a Stopover in Lymph Nodes](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/melanoma-spread-lymph-nodes-ferroptosis)

Posted: September 30, 2020

Melanoma cells that pass through the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream are more resistant to cell death and spread more readily than cells that enter the bloodstream directly. The finding could lead to new treatment approaches.
- [Off Target: Investigating the Abscopal Effect as a Treatment for Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/cancer-abscopal-effect-radiation-immunotherapy)

Posted: January 28, 2020

In people with cancer, the abscopal effect occurs when radiation—or another type of localized therapy—shrinks a targeted tumor but also causes untreated tumors in the body to shrink. Researchers are trying to better understand this phenomenon and take advantage of it to improve cancer therapy.
- [Some Brain Cells May Help to Fuel Cancer Metastasis](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/brain-metastasis-astrocytes-ppar-gamma)

Posted: November 21, 2019

Brain cells called astrocytes can activate PPAR-gamma, a growth protein in cancer cells that helps them gain a foothold in the brain, a new study shows. The findings suggest that drugs that block PPAR-gamma activity may help treat brain metastases.
- [FDA Approves Entrectinib Based on Tumor Genetics Rather Than Cancer Type](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/fda-entrectinib-ntrk-fusion)

Posted: September 17, 2019

FDA has approved entrectinib (Rozlytrek) for the treatment of children and adults with tumors bearing an NTRK gene fusion. The approval also covers adults with non-small cell lung cancer harboring a ROS1 gene fusion.
- [When Cancer Spreads to Bone, A Single Dose of Radiation Therapy May Control Pain](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/bone-metastases-pain-single-radiation-dose)

Posted: May 21, 2019

New findings from a clinical trial suggest that a single dose of radiation therapy may control painful bone metastases as effectively as multiple lower doses of radiation therapy.
- [NCI-MATCH precision medicine clinical trial releases new findings, strengthens path forward for targeted cancer therapies](/news-events/press-releases/2018/nci-match-first-results)

- [Matters of the Heart: Why Are Cardiac Tumors So Rare?](/types/metastatic-cancer/research/cardiac-tumors)

Posted: February 10, 2009

Cardiac tumors that originate in the heart itself are extremely rare. The highly specialized and most abundant cell in the heart may explain why the organ is such an inhospitable host to cancer.
