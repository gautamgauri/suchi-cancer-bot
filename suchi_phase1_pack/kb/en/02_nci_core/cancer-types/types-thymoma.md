## Overview

Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare tumors that form in cells on the thymus. Thymomas grow slowly and rarely spread beyond the thymus. Thymic carcinoma grows faster, often spreads to other parts of the body, and is harder to treat. Explore the links on this page to learn more about thymoma and thymic carcinoma treatment and clinical trials.
