# Cervical Cancer Stages - NCI

# Cervical Cancer Stages

A cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, especially whether the cancer has spread from where it first formed to other parts of the body. It is important to know the stage of [cervical cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444973&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in order to plan the best treatment.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [staging system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used for cervical cancer. Learn about [tests and procedures used to determine the stage of cervical cancer](/types/cervical/diagnosis).

## Stage I cervical cancer

In stage I, cervical cancer has formed and is found in the cervix only. It is divided into stages IA and IB, based on the size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the deepest point of tumor invasion.

Stage IA is subdivided based on the deepest point of tumor invasion.

An inset shows cancer cells in the cervix that can only be seen under a microscope. The cancer in stage IA1 is not more than 3 mm deep. The cancer in stage IA2 is more than 3 but not more than 5 mm deep.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/658902-750.jpg "Stage IA1 and IA2 cervical cancer; drawing shows a cross-section of the cervix and vagina. An inset shows cancer cells in the cervix that can only be seen under a microscope. The cancer in stage IA1 is not more than 3 mm deep. The cancer in stage IA2 is more than 3 but not more than 5 mm deep.")

Stage IA1 and IA2 cervical cancer. A very small amount of cancer that can only be seen under a microscope is found in the tissues of the cervix. In stage IA1, the cancer is not more than 3 millimeters deep. In stage IA2, the cancer is more than 3 but not more than 5 millimeters deep.

- **Stage IA1:** A very small amount of cancer that can only be seen with a microscope is found in the [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cervix. The deepest point of tumor invasion is 3 millimeters or less.
- **Stage IA2:** A very small amount of cancer that can only be seen with a microscope is found in the tissues of the cervix. The deepest point of tumor invasion is more than 3 millimeters but not more than 5 millimeters.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/578121.jpg)![Millimeters; drawing shows millimeters (mm) using everyday objects. A sharp pencil point shows 1 mm, a new crayon point shows 2 mm, and a new pencil-top eraser shows 5 mm.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/578121-750.jpg "Millimeters; drawing shows millimeters (mm) using everyday objects. A sharp pencil point shows 1 mm, a new crayon point shows 2 mm, and a new pencil-top eraser shows 5 mm.")

Millimeters (mm). A sharp pencil point is about 1 mm, a new crayon point is about 2 mm, and a new pencil eraser is about 5 mm.

Stage IB is subdivided based on the size of the tumor and the deepest point of tumor invasion.

- **Stage IB1:** The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller and the deepest point of tumor invasion is more than 5 millimeters. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/658903.jpg)![Stage IB1 cervical cancer; drawing shows a cross-section of the cervix and vagina and cancer in the cervix that is smaller than 2 cm.

## Stage II cervical cancer

In stage II, cervical cancer has spread to the upper two-thirds of the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to the tissue around the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Stage II is subdivided based on how far the cancer has spread. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/658904.jpg)![Stage II cervical cancer; drawing shows two cross-sections of the uterus, cervix, and vagina.

The drawing on the right shows stage IIB cancer that has spread from the cervix to the tissue around the uterus.")

Stage II cervical cancer. In stages IIA1 and IIA2, cancer has spread from the cervix to the upper two-thirds of the vagina but has not spread to the tissue around the uterus. In stage IIA1, the cancer is 4 centimeters or smaller. In stage IIA2, the cancer is larger than 4 centimeters. In stage IIB, cancer has spread from the cervix to the tissue around the uterus.

- **Stage IIA:** Cancer has spread from the cervix to the upper two-thirds of the vagina but has not spread to the tissue around the uterus. Stage IIA is further divided based on the size of the tumor:

- **Stage IIA1:** The tumor is 4 centimeters or smaller.
- **Stage IIA2:** The tumor is larger than 4 centimeters.
- **Stage IIB:** Cancer has spread from the cervix to the tissue around the uterus.

## Stage III cervical cancer

In stage III, cervical cancer has spread to the lower third of the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or to the [pelvic wall](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=410631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and/or has caused [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems, and/or involves [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Stage III is subdivided based on how far the cancer has spread.

- **Stage IIIA:** Cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina but has not spread to the pelvic wall. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/670190.jpg)![Stage IIIA cervical cancer; drawing shows a cross-section of the cervix and vagina. Cancer is shown in the cervix and in the full length of the vagina.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/670190-750.jpg "Stage IIIA cervical cancer; drawing shows a cross-section of the cervix and vagina. Cancer is shown in the cervix and in the full length of the vagina.")

Stage IIIA cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to the lower third of the vagina but has not spread to the pelvic wall.
- **Stage IIIB:** Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall; and/or the tumor has become large enough to block one or both [ureters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46638&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or has caused one or both kidneys to get bigger or stop working. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/670191.jpg)![Stage IIIB cervical cancer; drawing shows cancer in the cervix and pelvic wall. Also shown is cancer blocking the right ureter and an enlarged right ureter and right kidney.

Stage IIIB cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or the tumor has become large enough to block one or both ureters or has caused one or both kidneys to get bigger or stop working.
- **Stage IIIC:** Stage IIIC is divided into stages IIIC1 and IIIC2, based on the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/800958.jpg)![Stage IIIC cervical cancer; drawing shows stage IIIC1 cancer that has spread from the cervix to lymph nodes in the pelvis and stage IIIC2 cancer that has spread from the cervix to lymph nodes in the abdomen near the aorta.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/800958-750.jpg "Stage IIIC cervical cancer; drawing shows stage IIIC1 cancer that has spread from the cervix to lymph nodes in the pelvis and stage IIIC2 cancer that has spread from the cervix to lymph nodes in the abdomen near the aorta.")

## Stage IV cervical cancer

In stage IV, cervical cancer has spread beyond the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or has spread to the lining of the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or has spread to other parts of the body.

Stage IV is subdivided into stages IVA and IVB, based on where the cancer has spread.

- **Stage IVA:** Cancer has spread to nearby pelvic organs, such as the bladder or rectum. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/713967.jpg)![Stage IVA cervical cancer; drawing and inset show cancer that has spread from the cervix to the bladder and rectal wall.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/713967-750.jpg "Stage IVA cervical cancer; drawing and inset show cancer that has spread from the cervix to the bladder and rectal wall.")

Stage IVA cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to nearby pelvic organs, such as the bladder or rectum.
- **Stage IVB:** Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), bones, or distant [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/713968.jpg)![Stage IVB cervical cancer; drawing shows other parts of the body where cervical cancer may spread, including the lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone. An inset shows cancer cells spreading from the cervix, through the blood and lymph system, to another part of the body where metastatic cancer has formed.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/713968-750.jpg "Stage IVB cervical cancer; drawing shows other parts of the body where cervical cancer may spread, including the lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone. An inset shows cancer cells spreading from the cervix, through the blood and lymph system, to another part of the body where metastatic cancer has formed.")

Stage IVB cervical cancer. Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, lung, liver, or bone.

Stage IV is also called metastatic cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the [lymphatic system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if cervical cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually cervical cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic cervical cancer, not lung cancer.

## Recurrent cervical cancer

Recurrent cervical cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the cervix or as metastatic tumors in other parts of the body. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned in your body, if it has spread, and how far. The type of treatment that you have for recurrent cervical cancer will depend on how far it has spread.
