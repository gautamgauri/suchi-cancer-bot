# Breast Lumps and Breast Cancer in Children

A breast lump is a swelling, bump, or [mass](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/638197) in the breasts. Different types of breast lumps can happen in children and adolescents, and most are benign (not cancer). Breast lumps may not cause symptoms or need treatment, but it is still important to contact your child's doctor if you or your child notices any unusual changes.

Types of breast lumps in children

The following types of breast lumps can occur in children and adolescents:

- **Fibroadenomas** are the most common benign breast lumps seen in children aged 18 and younger. These lumps usually form in the [connective tissue](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44013) and [glandular tissue](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/805788) of the breast. They are usually painless and rarely cause symptoms. In some cases, fibroadenomas may grow very large and need to be removed by surgery. They may also stay the same size or disappear without treatment. Learn more about [Benign and Precancerous Breast Lumps and Conditions](/types/breast/causes-risk-factors/benign-breast-lumps).
- **Phyllodes tumors** are rare tumors that usually form in the connective tissue of the breast. Phyllodes tumors tend to grow quickly and get large, but they rarely spread to other parts of the body. Most are benign, but some may be malignant (cancer) or borderline (in between benign and malignant). Phyllodes tumors are usually removed by surgery, but they can come back. They are most common in women between 40 and 50 years of age but can also develop in children and adolescents. Learn more about [Benign and Precancerous Breast Lumps and Conditions](/types/breast/causes-risk-factors/benign-breast-lumps).
- **Fibrocystic breast changes** are common and benign changes within the breast that can make the breasts feel bumpy or irregular in consistency. There may also be breast swelling or discomfort, sensitive nipples, and itching. These changes are likely due to changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Fibrocystic breast changes can occur at any age but are most common in younger women. They don't require treatment. Learn more about [Benign and Precancerous Breast Lumps and Conditions](/types/breast/causes-risk-factors/benign-breast-lumps).
- **Breast cancer** is possible in children and adolescents but very rare. Less than 5% of all breast cancers occur in females younger than 40.

Causes and risk factors for breast lumps in children

Often, the exact cause of benign breast lumps is unknown.

Children and adolescents who have any of the following syndromes have an increased risk of fibroadenoma:

- [Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/304689)
- [Maffucci syndrome](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/781930)
- [Cowden syndrome](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/641941)

Children and adolescents who have [Li-Fraumeni syndrome](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46322) have an increased risk of phyllodes tumor.

##

Symptoms of breast lumps in children

Symptoms of a breast lump may not occur until the lump has grown bigger. Symptoms of benign breast lumps may include:

- a lump in the breast, underarm, or around the nipple
- a change in the size or shape of the breast that is not associated with puberty
- breast pain or discomfort

Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of these symptoms.

Tests to diagnose breast lumps in children

If your child has symptoms of a breast lump, their doctor will need to find out the cause. The doctor will ask about your child’s [personal](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/642019) and [family medical history](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/642015) and do a [physical exam](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/270871). Depending on these results, they may recommend other tests or procedures to help make a diagnosis. The results of the tests will also help you and your child's doctor plan treatment.

The following tests may be used to diagnose breast lumps in children and adolescents:

- A **clinical breast exam** is an exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breast and under the arm for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.
- An **ultrasound exam** uses high-energy sound waves (ultrasound), which bounce off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46587).
- **Biopsy** is the removal of a sample of tissue from the breast so that a [pathologist](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46244) can view it under a microscope. Biopsies may be done in kids and teens if the lump is large or fast growing.

##

Treatment of breast lumps in children

There are different types of treatment for children and adolescents with benign breast lumps. You and your child's care team will work together to decide treatment.

Treatment of breast lumps in children and adolescents may include:

- Watchful waiting, which is closely monitoring a person's condition without giving any treatment until symptoms appear or change. Watchful waiting may be done for fibroadenomas because they may disappear without treatment.
- Surgery to remove fibroadenomas that have not disappeared or phyllodes tumors. The whole breast is not removed during surgery. Surgery may also be used for lumps that come back.
