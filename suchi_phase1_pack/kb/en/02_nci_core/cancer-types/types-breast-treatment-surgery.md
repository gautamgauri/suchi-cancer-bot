# Breast Cancer Surgery

Most people with breast cancer or [ductal carcinoma in situ](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45674) (DCIS) will have surgery to remove the tumor and nearby breast [tissue](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46683). The two main types of surgery are [lumpectomy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45758) (breast-conserving surgery) and [mastectomy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45777), with or without [breast reconstruction](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46492).

Breast cancer surgery may also involve checking nearby [lymph nodes](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45762) for cancer. Usually, a [sentinel lymph node biopsy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46712) is done, often during a lumpectomy or mastectomy but sometimes as a separate surgery. Learn more about sentinel lymph node biopsy at [How Breast Cancer Is Diagnosed](/types/breast/diagnosis).
