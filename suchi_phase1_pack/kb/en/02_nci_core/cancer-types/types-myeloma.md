[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/myeloma/hp)

## Overview

Plasma cell neoplasms occur when abnormal plasma cells form cancerous tumors in bone or soft tissue. When there is only one tumor, the disease is called a plasmacytoma. When there are multiple tumors, it is called multiple myeloma. Explore the links on this page to learn more about multiple myeloma treatment, statistics, research, and clinical trials.

## Treatment

#### PDQ Treatment Information for Patients

## Causes & Prevention

NCI does not have PDQ evidence-based information about prevention of plasma cell neoplasms (including multiple myeloma).
