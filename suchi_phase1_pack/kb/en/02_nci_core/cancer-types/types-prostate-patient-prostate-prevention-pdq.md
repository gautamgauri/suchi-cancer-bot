# Prostate Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What is prevention?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/prostate/hp/prostate-prevention-pdq)

[Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is action taken to lower the chance of getting
cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer
in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower
the number of deaths caused by cancer.

To prevent new cancers from starting, [scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) look at [risk
factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that increases your
chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor;
anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is
called a cancer protective factor.

Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot.
For example, both smoking and inheriting certain [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are
risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be
avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be protective
factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and
increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does
not mean that you will not get cancer.

Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied.

## General Information About Prostate Cancer

### Key Points

- Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
form in the tissues of the prostate.
- Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in
the United States.

### Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.

The [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a
[gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the male
[reproductive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The prostate is just
below the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
collects and empties [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and in
front of the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the lower part
of the [intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). It is about the
size of a walnut and surrounds part of the [urethra](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46640&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the tube that empties urine from the
bladder). The prostate gland produces [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that makes up part of the [semen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems showing the ureters, bladder, prostate gland, urethra, penis, testicles, and other organs.

As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is called [benign prostatic hyperplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46509&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (BPH). BPH is not [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be
needed to correct it. The [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
of BPH or of other problems in the prostate may be
like symptoms of [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/462221.jpg)![Two-panel drawing shows normal male reproductive and urinary anatomy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Panel on the left shows the normal prostate and flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra. Panel on the right shows an enlarged prostate pressing on the bladder and urethra, blocking the flow of urine.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/462221-750.jpg "Two-panel drawing shows normal male reproductive and urinary anatomy and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Panel on the left shows the normal prostate and flow of urine from the bladder through the urethra. Panel on the right shows an enlarged prostate pressing on the bladder and urethra, blocking the flow of urine.")

Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.

### Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in the United States.

Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the United States, about one out of every eight men will be [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with prostate cancer. Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die of it.

See the following [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summaries for more information about prostate cancer:

## Prostate Cancer Prevention

### Key Points

- Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
help prevent cancer.
- The following *risk* factors may increase
the risk of prostate cancer:
- Age
- Family history of prostate cancer
- Race
- Hormones
- Vitamin E
- Folic acid
- Dairy and calcium
- The following *protective* factors may
decrease the risk of prostate cancer:
- Folate
- Finasteride and dutasteride
- The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or
their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
- Selenium and vitamin E
- Diet
- Multivitamins
- Lycopene
- Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways
to prevent cancer.
- New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical
trials.

### Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.

Avoiding [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having [overweight](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and not getting enough exercise. Increasing [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.

### The following *risk* factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer:

#### Age

[Prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is rare in men younger than 50 years of age.
The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.

#### Family history of prostate cancer

A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a
higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer.

#### Race

Prostate cancer occurs more often in African American men than in White men. African American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer.

#### Hormones

The [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) needs male [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to work the way it should. The main
male sex hormone is [testosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45581&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.

Testosterone is changed into [dihydrotestosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597120&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (DHT) by an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the
body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the
prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Vitamin E

The [Selenium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45113&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [Vitamin E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.

#### Folic acid

Folate is a kind of [vitamin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin [supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [fortified foods](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=655066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 [milligram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (mg) supplements of folic acid. However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their [diets](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Dairy and calcium

A diet high in dairy foods and [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.

### The following *protective* factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer:

#### Folate

Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.

#### Finasteride and dutasteride

[Finasteride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45336&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [dutasteride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=488413&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that changes testosterone into [dihydrotestosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597120&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied
whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55
years of age and older. This [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) compared with the group of men that did not, including [erectile dysfunction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321372&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), loss of desire for sex, and enlarged [breasts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In the PCPT, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46053&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but a follow-up analysis of the PCPT found that these men did not have more aggressive tumors.

The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less [semen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and enlarged breasts.

### The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:

#### Selenium and vitamin E

The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a [mineral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older
(50 years of age and older for African American men). The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.

#### Diet

It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain [fatty acids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45689&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) increased the risk of [high-grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386205&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.

#### Multivitamins

Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or [localized](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45754&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer. However, a large study showed an increased risk of [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.

#### Lycopene

Some studies have shown that a diet high in [lycopene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44909&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.

### Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.

Cancer prevention [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to study ways to
lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some
cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who
have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer.
Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had
cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type
or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer.
Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known
to have any [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for cancer.

The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to
find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These
may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting
smoking, or taking certain [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), vitamins, [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or
food supplements.

### New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about prostate cancer prevention. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
