Regular imaging tests to monitor the pancreas may help detect pancreatic cancer at an early stage in people who are at high risk, a new study suggests. This type of surveillance could also help improve how long these patients live.
- [Blood Test Accurately Detects Early-Stage Pancreatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/liquid-biopsy-detects-pancreatic-cancer)

Posted: May 10, 2024

In a new study involving nearly 1,000 people, a liquid biopsy accurately detected early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer. When paired with a test for the protein CA19-9, the combination accurately identified 97% of people with early-stage disease.
- [No Glucose? Pancreatic Cancer May Have a Ready Energy Alternative](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/pancreatic-cancer-uridine-energy-alternative)

Posted: June 22, 2023

A new study finds that pancreatic cancer cells have a ready way to overcome a lack of glucose, a frequent occurrence in this disease. They use another fuel source: a molecule called uridine. Findings from a related study suggest other cancers do as well.
- [In Mouse Study, KRAS-Targeted Drug Shows Potential against Pancreatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/pancreatic-cancer-kras-g12d-mrtx1133)

Posted: January 12, 2023

An experimental drug, MRTX1133, shrank tumors or halted their growth in several mouse models of human pancreatic cancer with KRAS G12D mutations, a new study shows. The models included one that is genetically engineered to closely mimic the human disease.
- [Abnormal Collagen May Be Weak Spot for Pancreatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/pancreatic-cancer-collagen-treatment-target)

Posted: August 22, 2022

Abnormal collagen that is formed only by pancreatic cancer cells ramps up activity that increases tumor growth and survival, a study found. In mice, blocking production or effects of the abnormal collagen made treatment for pancreatic cancer more effective.
- [Belzutifan Approved to Treat Tumors Linked to Inherited Disorder VHL](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/fda-belzutifan-vhl-tumors)

Posted: September 21, 2021

FDA has approved belzutifan (Welireg) to treat adults with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) who have tumors of the kidney, brain, nervous system, or pancreas. The drug may help these patients avoid or delay surgery by shrinking their tumors.
- [Could a Diabetes Diagnosis Help Detect Pancreatic Cancer Early?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/pancreatic-cancer-diabetes-early-detection)

Posted: July 7, 2021

Numerous studies have pointed to a link between new-onset diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Now, several large NCI-supported studies are testing ways to pick out those people whose diabetes might be a sign of early pancreatic cancer, when treatments may be more effective.
- [Boosting Dendritic Cells Helps the Immune System Find Pancreatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/pancreatic-cancer-dendritic-cells-immune-response)

Posted: April 28, 2020

The number of dendritic cells in a tumor may explain why immunotherapies work for some cancers but not others, a new study suggests. In mice, boosting dendritic cells triggered an immune response that slowed pancreatic tumor growth.
- [To Treat Pancreatic Cancer, Mouse Study Suggests Altering Tumor Microbiome](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/pancreatic-cancer-tumor-microbiome-survival)

Posted: September 9, 2019

In people with pancreatic cancer, the makeup of bacteria that populate their tumors could predict how long they live, results from a new study suggest. Experiments in mice suggested that altering the tumor microbiome could play a role in treatment.
- [Trial Highlights Complexities of Targeted Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/pancreatic-cancer-olaparib-brca-mutations)

Posted: June 26, 2019

Olaparib (Lynparza) may be beneficial for some people with advanced pancreatic cancer who have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, according to results from the POLO trial.
- [Researchers Discover Potential Way to Hit Elusive Target in Pancreatic Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/pancreatic-cancer-targeting-kras-indirectly)

Posted: April 4, 2019

Three research groups have found a potential way to kill cancer cells in pancreatic tumors by simultaneously blocking the activity of proteins that interact with KRAS proteins and disrupting an energy-creating process called autophagy.
