## Overview

Testicular cancer most often begins in germ cells (cells that make sperm). It is rare and is most frequently diagnosed in men ages 20 to 34. Most testicular cancers can be cured, even if diagnosed at an advanced stage. Explore the links on this page to learn more about testicular cancer screening, treatment, statistics, and clinical trials.
