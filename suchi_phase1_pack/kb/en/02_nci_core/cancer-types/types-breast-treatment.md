# Treatment for Breast Cancer - NCI

# Breast Cancer Treatment

Different types of treatment are available for breast cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment.

Your treatment options may include both local and systemic treatments. **Local treatments**, such as surgery and radiation, are directed at the area with cancer and not the whole body. **Systemic treatments**, such as chemotherapy, are drugs that can reach cancer cells throughout the body.

There are different treatment approaches for each type and stage of breast cancer. To learn more about treatment for specific types and stages of breast cancer, review **What kind of treatment will I receive?** below.
