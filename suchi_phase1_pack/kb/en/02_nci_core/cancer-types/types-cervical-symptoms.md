# Cervical Cancer Symptoms

Early on, [cervical cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444973&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually doesn’t have symptoms, making it hard to detect. Symptoms usually begin after the cancer has spread.

When symptoms of [early-stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561398&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cervical cancer do occur, they may include

- vaginal bleeding after sex
- vaginal bleeding after [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- vaginal bleeding between periods or periods that are heavier or longer than normal
- vaginal discharge that is watery and has a strong odor or that contains blood
- [pelvic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45087&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pain or pain during sex

Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer (cancer has spread beyond the cervix to other parts of the body) may include the symptoms of early-stage cervical cancer and

- difficult or painful bowel movements or bleeding from the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when having a bowel movement
- difficult or painful urination or blood in the urine
- dull backache
- swelling of the legs
- pain in the abdomen
- feeling tired

These symptoms may be caused by many conditions other than cervical cancer. The only way to know is to see a health professional. If it is cervical cancer, ignoring symptoms can delay treatment and make it less effective.
