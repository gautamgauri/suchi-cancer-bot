- [More Immunotherapy Options Approved for Treating Endometrial Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/endometrial-cancer-durvalumab-pembrolizumab-chemotherapy)

Posted: August 6, 2024

People with advanced endometrial cancer now have new FDA-approved treatment options: pembrolizumab and durvalumab, paired with chemotherapy, for tumors with a genetic change called mismatch repair deficiency. The agency also expanded the approved uses of dostarlimab for the disease.

Posted: April 12, 2023

In two clinical trials, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with standard chemotherapy substantially increased how long people with advanced endometrial cancer lived without their cancer worsening, particularly those with dMMR or MSI-high tumors.
- [Trastuzumab May Improve Survival in Women with Rare Endometrial Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/endometrial-cancer-usc-her2-trastuzumab)

Posted: August 13, 2020

For some women with HER2-positive uterine serous carcinoma, a rare type of endometrial cancer, treating them with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and chemotherapy may help them live longer, according to updated results from a small clinical trial.
- [Women Experience More Side Effects from Pelvic Radiation than Realized](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/patient-reported-side-effects-radiation-cervical-uterine-cancer)

Posted: April 8, 2020

Women with cervical or uterine cancer who received radiation to the pelvic region reported side effects much more often using an online reporting system called PRO-CTCAE than they did during conversations with their clinicians, a new study shows.
- [Can Some Women Treated for Endometrial Cancer Forgo Radiation after Surgery?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/endometrial-cancer-chemotherapy-without-radiation)

Posted: July 15, 2019

Some women with endometrial cancer may be able to receive less intensive treatment, chemotherapy and no radiation, without increasing their risk of the disease recurring within 5 years, according to the results of a randomized clinical trial.
- [Study Shows Incidence Rates of Aggressive Subtypes of Uterine Cancer Rising](/news-events/press-releases/2019/rate-aggressive-uterine-cancers-rising)

Posted: May 22, 2019

An NCI-led study shows rates for aggressive subtypes of uterine cancer rose rapidly among women ages 30 to 79 from 2000–2015. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, also reveal racial disparities in incidence and survival rates.
- [Study Provides Closer Look at Postmenopausal Bleeding and Endometrial Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/endometrial-cancer-bleeding-common-symptom)

Posted: August 29, 2018

A new study has found that 90% of postmenopausal women diagnosed with endometrial cancer reported vaginal bleeding before their diagnosis. Approximately 9% of postmenopausal women who saw a doctor for bleeding, the study showed, later received an endometrial cancer diagnosis.
- [Study Shows Experimental Screening Test Can Detect Endometrial and Ovarian Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/liquid-biopsy-screening-test-endometrial-ovarian)

Posted: May 2, 2018

Scientists have struggled to come up with a simple test to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers early, when they are most likely to respond to treatment. Can a liquid biopsy test called PapSEEK change that?
- [Endometrial Cancer Incidence Rising in the US and Worldwide](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/endometrial-cancer-incidence-rising)

Posted: November 20, 2017

Diagnoses of endometrial cancer have increased worldwide in recent years, with rates rising in more than half of the 43 countries studied during the decade ending around 2010, a team of international researchers has shown.
