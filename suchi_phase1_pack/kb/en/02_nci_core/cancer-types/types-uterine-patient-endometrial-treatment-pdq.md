### Key Points

- Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.
- Obesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
- Taking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone
(without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
- Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal
bleeding or pain in the pelvis.
- Tests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose
endometrial cancer.
- Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

### Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.

The [endometrium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the
lining of the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a hollow, muscular [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in a woman’s
[pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The uterus is where a
[fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grows. In most nonpregnant
women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which leads to the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609921.jpg)![Anatomy of the female reproductive system; drawing shows the uterus, myometrium (muscular outer layer of the uterus), endometrium (inner lining of the uterus), ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609921-750.jpg "Anatomy of the female reproductive system; drawing shows the uterus, myometrium (muscular outer layer of the uterus), endometrium (inner lining of the uterus), ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina.")

Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium.

[Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the endometrium
is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called
[sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45562&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the uterus. See the
[PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summary on [Uterine Sarcoma Treatment](/types/uterine/patient/uterine-sarcoma-treatment-pdq) for more information about [uterine sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Obesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease
is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for [endometrial cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444987&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:

- Taking [estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HRT) after [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Taking [tamoxifen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509341&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
to [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treat [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Obesity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having [metabolic syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643126&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having type 2 [diabetes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44911&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Exposure of endometrial [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) made by the body. This may be caused by:

- Never giving birth.
- [Menstruating](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46297&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at an early age.
- Starting menopause at a later age.
- Having [polycystic ovary syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454780&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having a [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of endometrial cancer in a [first-degree relative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460150&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (mother, sister, or daughter).
- Having certain [genetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46391&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [Lynch syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44882&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having [endometrial hyperplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=349455&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.

### Taking tamoxifen for breast cancer or taking estrogen alone (without progesterone) can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.

[Endometrial cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444987&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may develop in [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients who have
been treated with [tamoxifen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509341&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A
patient who takes this [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and has [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) bleeding should have a [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam and a [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [endometrial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45044&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lining if needed. Women taking [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a
[hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that can affect the growth
of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.
Taking estrogen combined with [progesterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45158&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (another hormone) does not increase a
woman’s risk of endometrial cancer.

### Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal bleeding or pain in the pelvis.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by endometrial cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:

- Vaginal bleeding or [discharge](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443583&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) not related to
menstruation (periods).
- Vaginal bleeding after menopause.
- Difficult or painful [urination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Pain during sexual intercourse.
- Pain in the [pelvic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45087&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) area.

### Tests that examine the endometrium are used to diagnose endometrial cancer.

Because endometrial cancer begins inside the uterus, it does not
usually show up in the results of a [Pap
test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45978&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For this reason, a sample of endometrial
[tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) must be removed and checked
under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to look for cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). One of the following procedures may be
used:

- **[Endometrial biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322856&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus. The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.
- **[Dilatation and curettage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407746&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The cervix is [dilated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257207&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and a [curette](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46460&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This procedure is also called a D&C.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/680398.jpg)![Dilatation and curettage (D and C). Three-panel drawing showing a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a D and C procedure. The first panel shows a speculum widening the opening of the vagina. The cervix, uterus with abnormal tissue, bladder, and rectum are also shown; an inset shows the lower half of a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.

The middle panel shows the uterus and a dilator inserted through the vagina into the cervix. The third panel shows a curette scraping out abnormal tissue from the uterus; an inset shows a close up of the curette with the abnormal tissue in it.")

Dilatation and curettage (D and C). A speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it in order to look at the cervix (first panel). A dilator is used to widen the cervix (middle panel). A curette is put through the cervix into the uterus to scrape out abnormal tissue (last panel).
- **Hysteroscopy**: A procedure to look inside the uterus for abnormal areas. A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. A hysteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.

Other tests and procedures used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) endometrial cancer include the following:

- **[Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
- **[Transvaginal ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46633&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam**: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An [ultrasound transducer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367430&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The doctor can identify [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by looking at the sonogram.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618018.jpg)![Transvaginal ultrasound; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a transvaginal ultrasound procedure. An ultrasound probe (a device that makes sound waves that bounce off tissues inside the body) is shown inserted into the vagina. The bladder, uterus, right fallopian tube, and right ovary are also shown. The inset shows the diagnostic sonographer (a person trained to perform ultrasound procedures) examining a woman on a table, and a computer screen shows an image of the patient’s internal tissues.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/618018-750.jpg "Transvaginal ultrasound; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a transvaginal ultrasound procedure.

Transvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe connected to a computer is inserted into the vagina and is gently moved to show different organs. The probe bounces sound waves off internal organs and tissues to make echoes that form a sonogram (computer picture).

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following:

- The [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body).
- How the cancer cells look under a microscope.
- Whether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone.

Endometrial cancer can usually be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) because it is usually diagnosed early.

## Stages of Endometrial Cancer

### Key Points

- After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are
done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other
parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- The following stages are used for endometrial
cancer:
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:
- Low-risk endometrial cancer
- High-risk endometrial cancer
- Endometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out whether the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the
[uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body
is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the
staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important
to know the stage in
order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A [hysterectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (an operation in
which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat [endometrial cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444987&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer to help find out whether the
cancer has spread.

The following procedures may be used in the staging process:

- **[Pelvic exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), uterus, [fallopian tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A [speculum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or [nurse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A [Pap test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45978&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two [lubricated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924.jpg)![Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam. The uterus, left fallopian tube, left ovary, cervix, vagina, bladder, and rectum are shown. Two gloved fingers of one hand of the doctor or nurse are shown inserted into the vagina, while the other hand is shown pressing on the lower abdomen. The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/609924-750.jpg "Pelvic exam; drawing shows a side view of the female reproductive anatomy during a pelvic exam.

The inset shows a woman covered by a drape on an exam table with her legs apart and her feet in stirrups.")

Pelvic exam. A doctor or nurse inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and presses on the lower abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, and rectum are also checked.
- **[Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (positron emission tomography scan)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
- **[Lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A surgical procedure in which the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are removed from the [pelvic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45087&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:

#### Stage I

Drawing on the left shows stage IA, with cancer in the endometrium and myometrium of the uterus. Drawing on the right shows stage IB, with cancer more than halfway through the myometrium. Also shown are the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and vagina.")

Stage IA and stage IB endometrial cancer. In stage IA, cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (the muscle layer of the uterus). In stage IB, cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.

In [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is
found in the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only. Stage I is divided
into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.

- [Stage IA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is in the [endometrium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) only or less than halfway through the [myometrium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46280&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (muscle layer of the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- [Stage IB](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread halfway or more into the [myometrium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46280&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Stage II

Cancer is shown in the endometrium and myometrium of the uterus and in the cervix.")

Stage II endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.

In [stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45117&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
has spread into [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but has not spread outside the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Stage III

In [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45118&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
has spread beyond the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but has not spread beyond the
[pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage III is divided into
stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.

Stage IIIC endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (the largest artery in the body that carries blood away from the heart).

#### Stage IV

In [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45119&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
has spread beyond the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB,
based on how far the cancer has spread.

- [Stage IVA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45119&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread to the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) wall.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/735680.jpg)![Stage IVA endometrial cancer shown in a side-view cross-section drawing of the uterus, bladder, cervix, vagina, small intestine, and large intestine.

Stage IVB endometrial cancer. The cancer has spread to parts of the body outside the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.

### Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:

#### Low-risk endometrial cancer

[Grades](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774694&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) 1 and 2 [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.

#### High-risk endometrial cancer

[Grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774694&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) 3 [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine [papillary serous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44781&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [clear cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [carcinosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44003&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are three subtypes of [endometrial cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444987&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are considered grade 3.

### Endometrial cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back in the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the
[pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), in
[lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the
[abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or in other parts of the
body.

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial
cancer.
- Five types of standard treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Targeted therapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
trials.
- Treatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with [endometrial
cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444987&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some
are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help
improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### Five types of standard treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (removing the cancer in
an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The
following surgical procedures may be used:

- [Total hysterectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45929&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including the [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the operation is called a [vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [hysterectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cut) in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the operation is called a total [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a [laparoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44360&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/612116.jpg)![Hysterectomy; drawing shows the female reproductive anatomy, including the ovaries, uterus, vagina, fallopian tubes, and cervix. Dotted lines show which organs and tissues are removed in a total hysterectomy, a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, and a radical hysterectomy. An inset shows the location of two possible incisions on the abdomen: a low transverse incision is just above the pubic area and a vertical incision is between the navel and the pubic area.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/612116-750.jpg "Hysterectomy; drawing shows the female reproductive anatomy, including the ovaries, uterus, vagina, fallopian tubes, and cervix. Dotted lines show which organs and tissues are removed in a total hysterectomy, a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, and a radical hysterectomy. An inset shows the location of two possible incisions on the abdomen: a low transverse incision is just above the pubic area and a vertical incision is between the navel and the pubic area.")

Hysterectomy. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and nearby tissue are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision.
- [Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322852&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove both [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and both [fallopian
tubes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Radical hysterectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322879&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may also be removed.
- [Lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the [pelvic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45087&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) area and a sample of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
time of the surgery, some patients may be given [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or
[hormone treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after surgery to kill any cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are left. Treatment given
after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
[adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:

- [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
- [Internal radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substance sealed in needles, [seeds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), wires, or [catheters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are placed directly into or near the cancer.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as
[palliative therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to relieve
[symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and improve [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Chemotherapy

[Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

#### Hormone therapy

[Hormone therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that removes [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach ([receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44359&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.

#### Targeted therapy

[Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. [Monoclonal antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [mTOR inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=753869&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [signal transduction inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.

- Monoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They may be used alone or to carry drugs, [toxins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. [Bevacizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46115&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to treat [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45118&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45119&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [recurrent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) endometrial cancer.

How do monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
- mTOR inhibitor therapy: mTOR inhibitors block a protein called [mTOR](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653126&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the growth of new [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) need to grow. [Everolimus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386203&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and ridaforolimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.
- Signal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block [signals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561720&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are passed from one [molecule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. [Metformin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=631045&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of endometrial cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
