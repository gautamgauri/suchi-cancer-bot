## Overview

There are four main types of thyroid cancer. These are papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic. Papillary is the most common type. The four types differ in how aggressive they are. Thyroid cancer that is found at an early stage can often be treated successfully. Explore the links on this page to learn more about thyroid cancer treatment, screening, statistics, research, and clinical trials.
