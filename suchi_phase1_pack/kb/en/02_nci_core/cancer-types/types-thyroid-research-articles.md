- [Selpercatinib Slows Progression of RET-Positive Lung, Medullary Thyroid Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/selpercatinib-ret-lung-medullary-thyroid)

Posted: November 15, 2023

For people with lung cancer and medullary thyroid cancer whose tumors have changes in the RET gene, selpercatinib improved progression-free survival compared with other common treatments, according to new clinical trial results.
- [Why Have Thyroid Cancer Diagnoses Spiked for US Women?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/thyroid-cancer-diagnosed-more-in-women)

Posted: September 28, 2021

Women are far more likely than men to be diagnosed with small thyroid cancers that probably would have never caused problems during their lifetime, a new study finds. The results may help explain why thyroid cancer seems to be more common in women.
- [Selpercatinib Approved for Thyroid and Lung Cancers with RET Gene Alterations](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/fda-selpercatinib-thyroid-lung-cancer-ret-alterations)

Posted: June 15, 2020

FDA has granted accelerated approval for selpercatinib (Retevmo) to treat certain patients with thyroid cancer or non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have RET gene alterations. The drug, which works by blocking the activity of RET proteins, was approved based on the results of the LIBRETTO-001 trial.
- [Genomic Test Helps Identify Thyroid Nodules That Don’t Require Surgery](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/thyroid-cancer-diagnostic-genomic-test)

Posted: November 30, 2018

The test measures genomic changes in thyroid biopsy samples and generates a score based on how strongly each change is associated with thyroid cancer. A study showed the test accurately identified samples that, after surgery, were found to be benign.
- [Dabrafenib–Trametinib Combination Approved for Melanoma, Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/fda-dabrafenib-trametinib-melanoma-thyroid)

Posted: May 25, 2018

FDA recently approved the targeted-drug combination to treat patients with advanced melanoma and a subset of patients with a rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer whose tumors have a specific mutation in the BRAF gene.
- [Patients Who Choose No Intervention for Small Thyroid Cancers Report Lack of Support](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/thyroid-cancer-surveillance-support)

Posted: April 27, 2017

Patients who choose not to pursue immediate biopsy or treatment for small, asymptomatic thyroid cancers, or suspected cancers, can experience a lack of support from doctors and loved ones, a new study shows.
- [After Rising for Decades, Thyroid Cancer Incidence Stabilizes](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/thyroid-incidence-trend)

Posted: May 6, 2016

After rising steadily since the 1990s, the incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States may be leveling off, according to an analysis of data from NCI’s SEER program.
- [FDA Approves Lenvatinib for Radioactive Iodine-Refractory Thyroid Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/fda-approves-lenvima)

Posted: March 2, 2015

The FDA has approved lenvatinib (Lenvima) to treat some patients with the most common type of thyroid cancer.
