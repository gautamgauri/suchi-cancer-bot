## Overview

Bone cancer is rare and includes several types. Some bone cancers, including osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, are seen most often in children and young adults. Explore the links on this page to learn about bone cancer treatment, statistics, research, and clinical trials.

The [Primary Bone Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/bone/bone-fact-sheet) fact sheet has additional basic information.
