## Overview

Kidney cancer can develop in adults and children. The main types of kidney cancer are renal cell cancer, transitional cell cancer, and Wilms tumor. Certain inherited conditions increase the risk of kidney cancer. Explore the links on this page to learn more about kidney cancer treatment, statistics, research, and clinical trials.
