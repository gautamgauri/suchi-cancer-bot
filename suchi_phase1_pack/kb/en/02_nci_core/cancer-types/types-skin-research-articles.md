- [Immunotherapy before Surgery Appears Effective for Some with Melanoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/melanoma-immunotherapy-before-surgery)

Posted: October 12, 2022

For melanoma that can be treated with surgery, a few doses of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) beforehand looks to be a good choice. In a clinical trial, people who got the presurgical immunotherapy were much less likely to have their cancer come back than those who only received it after surgery.
- [Androgen Receptor May Explain Sex Differences in Melanoma Treatment Response](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/melanoma-treatment-androgen-receptor)

Posted: July 15, 2022

Male patients with metastatic melanoma don’t live as long as females, and their tumors are more likely to become resistant to commonly used treatments. A new study may help explain why: the androgen receptor.
- [Study Adds to Debate about Screening for Melanoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/skin-cancer-screening-melanoma-overdiagnosis)

Posted: May 4, 2022

Regular skin cancer screening leads to many diagnoses of very early-stage melanomas, results from a new study suggest. The results add to a debate about whether screening is fueling an overdiagnosis of melanoma in the United States.
- [Opdualag Becomes First FDA-Approved Immunotherapy to Target LAG-3](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/fda-opdualag-melanoma-lag-3)

Posted: April 6, 2022

The immunotherapy treatment, which combines the LAG-3 inhibitor relatlimab and PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab, becomes the first new immune checkpoint inhibitor approved in 8 years. Both drugs are given to patients via a single infusion to treat advanced melanoma.
- [Alzheimer’s-Linked Protein May Help Melanoma Spread to Brain](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/melanoma-brain-metastases-amyloid-beta)

Posted: April 1, 2022

Melanoma cells that travel to the brain produce their own amyloid beta, helping the cells survive and form metastases, a new study in mice shows. The Alzheimer’s-linked proteins appear to tamp down the brain’s immune response to the cancer cells.
- [A high-fiber diet may improve the response of melanoma patients to immunotherapy](/news-events/press-releases/2021/high-fiber-diet-melanoma-immunotherapy)

Posted: December 23, 2021

NCI researchers have found that a diet rich in fiber may help some people being treated for melanoma respond to immunotherapy treatment by influencing the gut microbiome. The new findings come from an analysis of people with melanoma and mouse models of the disease.
- [Immunotherapy Combination Most Effective as Initial Treatment for BRAF+ Melanoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/advanced-melanoma-braf-immunotherapy-first)

Posted: December 17, 2021

Trial results show patients who received the immunotherapy pembrolizumab (Keytruda) after surgery to remove high-risk stage II melanomas were less likely to have the cancer come back than those who received no treatment after surgery.
- [Nivolumab and Relatlimab Combination Shows Promise in Advanced Melanoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/melanoma-nivolumab-relatlimab-immunotherapy)

Posted: June 21, 2021

People with advanced melanoma treated with two immunotherapy drugs—nivolumab (Opdivo) and a new drug called relatlimab—lived longer without their cancer getting worse than those treated only with nivolumab, results from a large clinical trial show.
- [Study Details Long-Term Side Effects of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-melanoma-long-term-side-effects)

Posted: April 30, 2021

While doctors are familiar with the short-term side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors, less is known about potential long-term side effects. A new study details the chronic side effects of these drugs in people who received them as part of treatment for melanoma.
- [Immunotherapy Drug Tebentafusp Improves Survival in Advanced Uveal Melanoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/tebentafusp-uveal-melanoma-improves-survival)

Posted: April 29, 2021

In a large trial, tebentafusp helped patients with uveal melanoma live longer than patients who received other treatments for the disease. Uveal melanoma is an aggressive cancer of the eye, and many patients do not survive for a year once it has spread.
- [Fecal microbiota transplants help patients with advanced melanoma respond to immunotherapy](/news-events/press-releases/2021/fecal-transplants-cancer-immunotherapy)

Posted: February 4, 2021

For patients with cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy drugs, the use of fecal transplants to modify the gut microbiome may help some of these patients respond to the immunotherapy drugs.
- [Melanoma Cells Are More Likely to Spread after a Stopover in Lymph Nodes](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/melanoma-spread-lymph-nodes-ferroptosis)

Posted: September 30, 2020

Melanoma cells that pass through the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream are more resistant to cell death and spread more readily than cells that enter the bloodstream directly. The finding could lead to new treatment approaches.
- [Deaths from Metastatic Melanoma Drop Substantially in the United States](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/metastatic-melanoma-deaths-drop)

Posted: April 21, 2020
