# Treatment for Inflammatory Breast Cancer - NCI

# Inflammatory Breast Cancer Treatment

Different types of treatments are available for inflammatory breast cancer. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide on your treatment plan, which likely will include more than one type of treatment. Learn more about inflammatory breast cancer symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis at [Inflammatory Breast Cancer](/types/breast/breast-cancer-types/inflammatory).

Inflammatory breast cancer is always diagnosed as either stage III or stage IV disease. Learn more about how breast cancer is staged at [Breast Cancer Stages](/types/breast/stages).

Treating stage III (also called stage 3) inflammatory breast cancer

Stage III inflammatory breast cancer is generally treated with a combination of [chemotherapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45214), surgery to remove the tumor, and [radiation therapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44971). [Immunotherapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45729), [targeted therapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/270742), and [hormone therapy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45110) may also be given, depending on whether the cancer has certain [biomarkers](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45618).

- **Chemotherapy.** For stage III inflammatory breast cancer, chemotherapy is often used to help shrink the tumor before surgery to remove it. When chemotherapy is given before surgery, it is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may also reduce the number of [lymph nodes](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45762) that need to be removed during surgery. Chemotherapy may also be given after surgery (called adjuvant chemotherapy). Learn more about [Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer](/types/breast/treatment/chemotherapy).
- **Surgery.** The standard type of surgery for inflammatory breast cancer is a [modified radical mastectomy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46285), which removes the entire breast and the lymph nodes under the arm. Since inflammatory breast cancer affects large areas of skin on the breast, [lumpectomy](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45758) (breast-conserving surgery) and skin-sparing mastectomy are not options. Learn more about [Mastectomy](/types/breast/treatment/surgery/mastectomy).
- **Radiation therapy.** After surgery, you will likely have radiation therapy to the [chest wall](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/44996) where the breast was removed to reduce the chance of breast cancer returning in the breast or chest wall. Learn more about [Radiation for Breast Cancer](/types/breast/treatment/radiation).
- **Hormone therapy.** You may receive hormone therapy if the cancer tests positive for [estrogen receptors](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/46409) and/or [progesterone receptors](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/423248). Hormone therapy may also be given when the [hormone receptor status](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/805167) of the cancer is unknown. Hormone therapy for inflammatory breast cancer is typically started during or after radiation therapy. Learn more about [Hormone Therapy for Breast Cancer](/types/breast/treatment/hormone-therapy).
- **Immunotherapy.** You may receive immunotherapy, such as [pembrolizumab](/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pembrolizumab), if biomarker tests suggest that the cancer is [triple-negative](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/639916). Learn more about [Immunotherapy for Breast Cancer](/types/breast/treatment/immunotherapy).
- **Targeted therapy.** You may receive targeted therapy, such as [trastuzumab](/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/trastuzumab), if biomarker tests suggest that the cancer has certain [biomarkers](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45618). Learn more about [Targeted Therapy for Breast Cancer](/types/breast/treatment/targeted-therapy).

Treating metastatic or stage IV (also called stage 4) inflammatory breast cancer

In metastatic (stage IV or stage 4) inflammatory breast cancer, the cancer has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to distant parts of the body. Treatment for stage IV inflammatory breast cancer is the same as treatment for other types of metastatic breast cancer.

Learn more about treatment options at [Metastatic Breast Cancer](/types/breast/stages/metastatic-breast-cancer) in the section, “How is metastatic breast cancer treated?”

##

Treatment for recurrent inflammatory breast cancer

If cancer returns to the place where it began or nearby, it is called a locoregional [recurrence](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45861). Treatment for locoregional recurrence of inflammatory breast cancer may include chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Other drugs may be added, depending on whether your cancer has certain biomarkers. Treatment for inflammatory breast cancer that has come back in distant parts of the body may be similar to treatment for stage IV breast cancer.

Clinical trials

Joining a clinical trial may be an option. There are different types of clinical trials for people with breast cancer. For example, a treatment trial tests new treatments or new ways of using existing treatments. Supportive care and palliative care trials look at ways to improve quality of life, especially for those who have side effects from cancer and its treatment.

You can use the [clinical trial search](/research/participate/clinical-trials-search) to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting participants. This search allows you to filter trials based on the type of cancer, your age, and where the trials are being done. You can also review a list of NCI-supported [Breast Cancer Clinical Trials](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials/disease/breast-cancer?pn=1). Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found at [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).

Coping with inflammatory breast cancer treatment

Treatment for inflammatory breast cancer can be mentally and physically challenging. It is important that you bring up any questions and concerns you have with your health care team throughout your care and treatment to get the support you need.

In addition to support from your health care team and family, one-on-one counseling or in-person and online support groups can help you cope and improve your mental wellbeing. Learn more about how to manage the physical and emotional effects of breast cancer at [Living with Breast Cancer and Survivorship](/types/breast/breast-cancer-survivorship).
