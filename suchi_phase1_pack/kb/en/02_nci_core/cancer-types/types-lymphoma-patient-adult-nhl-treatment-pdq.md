## General Information About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

### Key Points

- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant
(cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive.
- Older age, being male, and having a weakened immune system can increase the risk of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever,
drenching night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.
- Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose and stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Certain factors affect prognosis (chance
of recovery) and treatment options.

### Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.

[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of
[cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that forms in the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The lymph system is part of the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It helps protect the body from [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and disease.

The lymph system is made up of the following:

- [Lymph](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46305&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Colorless, watery [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and carries [lymphocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45765&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). There are three types of lymphocytes:

- [B lymphocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44953&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that make [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help fight infection. Also called B cells. Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes.
- [T lymphocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. Also called T cells.
- [Natural killer cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44062&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that attack cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [viruses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45941&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Also called NK cells.
- Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.
- [Lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, [mediastinum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46288&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [groin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46375&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that makes lymphocytes, stores [red blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and lymphocytes, filters the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Thymus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46616&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): An organ in which T lymphocytes mature and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the [breastbone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=549425&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Tonsils](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46618&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Two small masses of lymph [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at the back of the [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is one tonsil on each side of the throat.
- [Bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and [platelets](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45840&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are made in the bone marrow.

The lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.

Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the lining of the [digestive tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bronchus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45629&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and skin.

There are two general types of [lymphomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270800&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults, including during [pregnancy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be [indolent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46355&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46053&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly, and has few [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly, and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different.

This summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:

**Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas**

- **[Follicular lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428287&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a very slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes. It affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen. Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment. The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back. Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment. Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma, such as [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428286&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409750&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** In most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, B lymphocytes that are turning into [plasma cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) make large amounts of a [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [monoclonal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=411378&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [immunoglobulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45725&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) M (IgM) antibody. High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to thicken. This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing, heart problems, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. It may be found when a [blood test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is done for another reason. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. Patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be checked for [hepatitis C virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44139&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) infection. It is also called Waldenström macroglobulinemia.
- **[Marginal zone lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=543124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone. The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be worse for patients aged 70 years or older, those with [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45908&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45909&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease, and those with high [lactate dehydrogenase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LDH) levels. There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma. They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed:

- **Nodal marginal zone lymphoma.** Nodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare. It is also called monocytoid [B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444967&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Gastric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44437&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Gastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach. This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the [mucosa](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257213&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that help make antibodies. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have *[Helicobacter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45706&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* [gastritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330169&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or an [autoimmune disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [Hashimoto thyroiditis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [Sjögren syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455423&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **Extragastric MALT lymphoma.** Extragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [salivary glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46196&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), lung, skin, and around the eye. This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment.
- **Mediterranean [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lymphoma.** This is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries. It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with [bacteria](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called *Campylobacter jejuni*. This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.
- **[Splenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467863&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) marginal zone lymphoma.** This type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the [peripheral blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46011&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bone marrow. The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal.
- **[Primary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46112&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [anaplastic large cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45552&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only. It can be a [benign](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45614&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (not cancer) [nodule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44502&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment.

**Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas**

- **Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.** Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also affected. Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may include [fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), drenching night sweats, and weight loss. These are also called B symptoms.
- **Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.** This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of [fibrous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=344349&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (scar-like) lymph tissue. A [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) most often forms behind the breastbone. It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. Most patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40 years.
- **[Follicular large cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44238&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), stage III.** Follicular large cell lymphoma, stage III, is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment of this type of follicular lymphoma is more like treatment of aggressive NHL than of indolent NHL.
- **Anaplastic large cell lymphoma.** Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes. The cancer cells also have a [marker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called CD30 on the surface of the cell.

There are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma:

- **Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.** This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma mostly affects the skin, but other parts of the body may also be affected. Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or [ulcers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390317&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the skin. This type of lymphoma is rare and indolent.
- **[Systemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) anaplastic large cell lymphoma.** This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. This type of lymphoma is more aggressive. Patients may have a lot of [anaplastic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45591&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lymphoma [kinase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641114&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ALK) protein inside the lymphoma cells. These patients have a better [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) than patients who do not have extra ALK protein. Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults. For more information, see [Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment](/types/lymphoma/patient/child-nhl-treatment-pdq).
- **[Extranodal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=539104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [NK](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44439&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-/[T-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45924&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose. It may also affect the [paranasal sinus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=518299&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), roof of the mouth, [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), skin, stomach, and [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Most cases of extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma have [Epstein-Barr virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the tumor cells. Sometimes hemophagocytic [syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occurs (a serious [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States.
- **[Lymphomatoid granulomatosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Lymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs. It may also affect the paranasal sinuses (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), skin, [kidneys](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In lymphomatoid granulomatosis, cancer invades the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and kills tissue. Because the cancer may spread to the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [intrathecal chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46681&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the brain is given.
- **[Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346464&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells. Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign. Other signs may include a skin rash, fever, weight loss, or drenching night sweats. There may also be high levels of gamma globulin (antibodies) in the blood. Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened.
- **[Peripheral T-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=405873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Peripheral T-cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes. This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus [gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. There are three subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma:

- **Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.** This is an uncommon type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men. It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a T-cell [receptor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called gamma/delta on the surface of the cell.
- **[Subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.** Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa. It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed.
- **Enteropathy-type [intestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44046&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) T-cell lymphoma.** This type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs in the small [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of patients with untreated [celiac disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=377726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (an [immune response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to gluten that causes [malnutrition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46014&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten-free [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rarely develop enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma.
- **Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.** This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels, especially the small blood vessels in the brain, kidney, lung, and skin. Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels. It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis.
- **[Burkitt lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45203&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Burkitt lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly. It may affect the jaw, bones of the face, bowel, kidneys, [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or other organs. There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma ([endemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [sporadic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339347&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [immunodeficiency](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46357&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) related). Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have [AIDS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45950&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment to [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) its spread may be given. Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults. For more information, see [Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment](/types/lymphoma/patient/child-nhl-treatment-pdq). Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma.
- **[Lymphoblastic lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597158&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Lymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells, but it usually begins in T cells. In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are too many [lymphoblasts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302475&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature white blood cells) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland. These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body, such as the bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults. It is a lot like [acute lymphoblastic leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45586&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood). For more information, see [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment](/types/leukemia/patient/adult-all-treatment-pdq).
- **[T-cell leukemia/lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269410&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by the [human T-cell leukemia virus type 1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269420&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HTLV-1). Signs include bone and skin [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), high blood [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels, and lymph nodes, spleen, and liver that are larger than normal.
- **[Mantle cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445048&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen, bone marrow, blood, and sometimes the [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), stomach, and intestines. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called [cyclin-D1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=729820&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a certain [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) change in the lymphoma cells. In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma, delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis.
- **[Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** This disease occurs in patients who have had a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and need lifelong [immunosuppressive therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45728&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and have Epstein-Barr virus in the cells. Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer.
- **True [histiocytic lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** This is a rare, very aggressive type of lymphoma. It is not known whether it begins in B cells or T cells. It does not respond well to treatment with standard [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Primary effusion lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455144&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Primary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells that are found in an area where there is a large build-up of fluid, such as the areas between the lining of the lung and [chest wall](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44996&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([pleural effusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45843&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), the sac around the heart and the heart ([pericardial effusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45825&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), or in the abdominal [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). There is usually no tumor that can be seen. This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who are infected with [HIV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44985&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Plasmablastic lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Plasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive. It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection.

### Older age, being male, and having a weakened immune system can increase the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it can develop in people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.

These and other risk factors may increase the risk of certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:

- Being older, male, or White.
- Having one of the following medical conditions that weakens the immune system:

- An [inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) immune [disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (such as [hypogammaglobulinemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=539110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- An autoimmune disease (such as [rheumatoid arthritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455398&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [psoriasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or Sjögren syndrome).
- HIV/AIDS.
- Human T-lymphotrophic virus type I or Epstein-Barr virus infection.
- *Helicobacter pylori* infection.
- Taking [immunosuppressant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45727&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after an organ transplant.

### Signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.

These signs and symptoms may be caused by non-Hodgkin
lymphoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the
following:

- Swelling in the lymph nodes in the neck, underarm,
groin, or stomach.
- Fever for no known reason.
- Drenching night sweats.
- Feeling very tired.
- Weight loss for no known reason.
- Skin rash or itchy skin.
- Pain in the chest, abdomen, or bones for no known reason.

When fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss occur together, this group of symptoms is called B symptoms.

Other signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur and depend on the following:

- Where the cancer forms in the body.
- The size of the tumor.
- How fast the tumor grows.

### Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to diagnose and stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **[Complete blood count](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45107&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CBC)**: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:

- The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
- The amount of [hemoglobin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the protein that carries [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in the red blood cells.
- The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/526546.jpg)![Complete blood count (CBC); left panel shows blood being drawn from a vein on the inside of the elbow using a tube attached to a syringe; right panel shows a laboratory test tube with blood cells separated into layers: plasma, white blood cells, platelets, and red blood cells.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/526546-750.jpg "Complete blood count (CBC); left panel shows blood being drawn from a vein on the inside of the elbow using a tube attached to a syringe; right panel shows a laboratory test tube with blood cells separated into layers: plasma, white blood cells, platelets, and red blood cells.")

Complete blood count (CBC). Blood is collected by inserting a needle into a vein and allowing the blood to flow into a tube. The blood sample is sent to the laboratory and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are counted. The CBC is used to test for, diagnose, and monitor many different conditions.
- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by
organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign
of disease.
- **[LDH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354465&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) test**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of lactic dehydrogenase. An increased amount of LDH in the blood may be a sign of tissue damage, lymphoma, or other diseases.
- **[Hepatitis B](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46146&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [hepatitis C](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44139&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) test**: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of hepatitis B virus-specific [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or antibodies and the amounts of hepatitis C virus-specific antibodies. These antigens or antibodies are called markers. Different markers or combinations of markers are used to determine whether a patient has a hepatitis B or C infection, has had a prior infection or [vaccination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or is susceptible to infection. Patients who have been treated for hepatitis B virus in the past need continued [monitoring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check if it has [reactivated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683532&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Knowing whether a person has hepatitis B or C may help plan treatment.
- **[HIV test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=759626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A test to measure the level of HIV antibodies in a sample of blood. Antibodies are made by the body when it is invaded by a [foreign](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=698772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substance. A high level of HIV antibodies may mean the body has been infected with HIV.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**:
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[PET scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (positron
emission tomography scan)**: A procedure to find [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor cells in the body. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
- **[Bone marrow aspiration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46505&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46506&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) views the bone marrow and bone under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to look for signs of cancer.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/554337.jpg)![Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; drawing shows a patient lying face down on a table and a bone marrow needle being inserted into the hip bone. An inset shows a close up of the needle being inserted through the skin and hip bone into the bone marrow.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/554337-750.jpg "Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy; drawing shows a patient lying face down on a table and a bone marrow needle being inserted into the hip bone. An inset shows a close up of the needle being inserted through the skin and hip bone into the bone marrow.")

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. After a small area of skin is numbed, a long, hollow needle is inserted through the patient's skin and hip bone into the bone marrow. A sample of bone marrow and a small piece of bone are removed for examination under a microscope.
- **Lymph node biopsy**: The
removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:

- **[Excisional
biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46411&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of an entire lymph node.
- **[Incisional
biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46698&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of part of a lymph node.
- **[Core biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45657&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle.

If cancer is found, the following tests may be done to study the cancer cells:

- **[Immunohistochemistry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653117&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A [laboratory test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
- **[Cytogenetic analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A laboratory test in which the [chromosomes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.
- **[Immunophenotyping](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=341450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A laboratory test that uses antibodies to identify cancer cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. This test is used to help diagnose specific types of lymphoma.
- **[FISH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460228&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (fluorescence in situ hybridization)**: A laboratory test used to look at and count genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that contain fluorescent dyes are made in the laboratory and added to a sample of a patient’s cells or tissues. When these dyed pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes in the sample, they light up when viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The FISH test is used to help diagnose cancer and help plan treatment.

Other tests and procedures may be done depending on the signs and symptoms seen and where the cancer forms in the body.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The prognosis and treatment options depend on the following:

- The patient's signs and symptoms, including whether or not they have B symptoms (fever for no known reason, weight loss for no known reason, or drenching night sweats).
- The [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer (the size of the cancer tumors and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or lymph nodes).
- The type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- The amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood.
- Whether there are certain changes in the genes.
- The patient’s age, sex, and
general health.
- Whether the lymphoma is newly diagnosed, continues to grow during treatment, or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).

For non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy, treatment options also depend on:

- The wishes of the patient.
- Which trimester of pregnancy the patient is in.
- Whether the baby can be delivered early.

Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma spread more quickly than
others do. Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas that occur during pregnancy are
aggressive. Delaying treatment
of aggressive lymphoma until after the baby is born may lessen the mother's chance of survival. Immediate
treatment is often recommended, even during pregnancy.

## Stages of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

### Key Points

- After non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out
whether cancer cells have spread within the lymph
system or to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- The following stages are used for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma:
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- Non-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive, whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or recurrent.
- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out whether cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out the type of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and if cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
have spread within the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The
information gathered from the staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the
disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of the [tests and procedures](/types/lymphoma/patient/adult-nhl-treatment-pdq#_150) done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to help make decisions about treatment.

The following tests and procedures may also be used in the staging
process:

- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic
resonance imaging) with [gadolinium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597153&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A substance called gadolinium is [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into the patient through a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[Lumbar puncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46303&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure used to collect [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CSF) from the [spinal column](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=396787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/503953.jpg)![Lumbar puncture; drawing shows a patient lying in a curled position on a table and a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) being inserted into the lower back. Inset shows a close-up of the spinal needle inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lower part of the spinal column.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/503953-750.jpg "Lumbar puncture; drawing shows a patient lying in a curled position on a table and a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) being inserted into the lower back. Inset shows a close-up of the spinal needle inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lower part of the spinal column.")

Lumbar puncture. A patient lies in a curled position on a table. After a small area on the lower back is numbed, a spinal needle (a long, thin needle) is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). The fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing.

For [pregnant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests and procedures that protect the [fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the harms of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used. These tests and procedures include MRI (without contrast), lumbar puncture, and [ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### The following stages are used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma:

#### Stage I

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614643.jpg)![Stage I adult lymphoma; drawing shows cancer in one lymph node group and in the spleen. Also shown are the Waldeyer’s ring and the thymus. An inset shows a lymph node with a lymph vessel, an artery, and a vein. Cancer cells are shown in the lymph node.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614643-750.jpg "Stage I adult lymphoma; drawing shows cancer in one lymph node group and in the spleen. Also shown are the Waldeyer’s ring and the thymus. An inset shows a lymph node with a lymph vessel, an artery, and a vein. Cancer cells are shown in the lymph node.")

Stage I adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in one or more lymph nodes in a group of lymph nodes or, in rare cases, cancer is found in the Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen. In stage IE (not shown), cancer has spread to one area outside the lymph system.

[Stage I non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45906&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages I and IE.

In stage I, [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found in one of the following places in the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793442&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- One or more [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in a group of lymph nodes.
- [Waldeyer's ring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=777073&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Thymus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46616&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In stage IE, cancer is found in one area outside the lymph system.

#### Stage II

[Stage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45907&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is divided into stages II and IIE.

- In stage II, [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found in two or more groups of [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are either above the [diaphragm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46451&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or below the diaphragm. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614648.jpg)![Stage II adult lymphoma; drawing shows cancer in two lymph node groups above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm.

Stage III adult lymphoma. Cancer is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm; or in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the spleen.

In [stage III non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45908&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is found:

- in groups of [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) both above and below the [diaphragm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46451&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or
- in lymph nodes above the diaphragm and in the [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Stage IV

Also shown is primary cancer in the lymph nodes and a pullout of the brain with cerebrospinal fluid (in blue).")

Stage IV adult lymphoma. Cancer (a) has spread throughout one or more organs outside the lymph system; or (b) is found in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are either above the diaphragm or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or (c) is found in groups of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or (d) is found in the liver, bone marrow, more than one place in the lung, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.

In [stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45909&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- has spread throughout one or more [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) outside the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793442&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or
- is found in two or more groups of [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are either above the [diaphragm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46451&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or below the diaphragm and in one organ that is outside the lymph system and not near the affected lymph nodes; or
- is found in groups of lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and in any organ that is outside the lymph system; or
- is found in the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), more than one place in the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CSF). The cancer has not spread directly into the liver, bone marrow, lung, or CSF from nearby lymph nodes.

### Non-Hodgkin lymphomas may be grouped for treatment according to whether the cancer is indolent or aggressive, whether affected lymph nodes are next to each other in the body, and whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or recurrent.

For more information on the types of [indolent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (slow-growing) and [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (fast-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma, see the [General Information](/types/lymphoma/patient/adult-nhl-treatment-pdq#_376) section.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can also be described as [contiguous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [noncontiguous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350357&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Contiguous lymphomas: [Lymphomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with cancer are next
to each other.
- Noncontiguous lymphomas: Lymphomas in which the lymph nodes with cancer
are not next to each other, but are on the same side of the
[diaphragm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46451&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The lymphoma may come back
in the lymph system or in other parts of the body. Indolent lymphoma may come back as
aggressive lymphoma. Aggressive
lymphoma may come back as indolent lymphoma.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some
are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help
improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

For [pregnant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666677&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the [fetus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment decisions are based on the mother’s wishes, the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the trimester of the pregnancy. The treatment plan may change as the [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.

### Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.

Treatment will be overseen by a [medical
oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46290&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, or a [hematologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46370&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a doctor who specializes in treating [blood cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=733834&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The
medical oncologist may refer you to other [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who have experience and
are experts in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain
areas of [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These may include the following [specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Neurosurgeon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Neurologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Radiation
oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46546&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Endocrinologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46439&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Rehabilitation specialist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318825&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Fertility specialist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Other [oncology](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45434&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) specialists.

### Treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause side effects.

To learn more about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that begin during treatment for cancer, visit [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects").

Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called [late effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Treatment with [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of late effects.

Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:

- Heart problems.
- [Infertility](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46348&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (inability to have children).
- Loss of [bone density](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407755&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Neuropathy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46041&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) damage that causes numbness or trouble walking).
- A [second cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as:

- [Lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Brain cancer.
- [Kidney cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444995&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Bladder cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444968&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270800&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Myelodysplastic syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Acute myeloid leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46347&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you. Regular [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for late effects is important.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing.

[External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Sometimes [total-body irradiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is given before a [stem cell transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46695&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Proton beam radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of [protons](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44715&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near a tumor such as the heart or [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

External radiation therapy is used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and may also be used as [palliative therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to relieve symptoms and improve [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

For a pregnant woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be given after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the fetus. If treatment is needed right away, the woman may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. A [lead shield](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798602&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to cover the pregnant woman's [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help protect the fetus from radiation as much as possible.

#### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([intrathecal chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46681&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Combination chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs. [Steroid drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46601&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be added, to lessen
[inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and lower the body's [immune response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Systemic combination chemotherapy is used for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of [lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that first forms in the [testicles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46611&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [sinuses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (hollow areas) around the nose, [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428286&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [Burkitt lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45203&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lymphoblastic lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597158&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and some [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46053&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [T-cell lymphomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45924&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is called [CNS prophylaxis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46472&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Top section shows a syringe and needle injecting anticancer drugs into the Ommaya reservoir. Bottom section shows a syringe and needle injecting anticancer drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid in the lower part of the spinal column.")

Intrathecal chemotherapy. Anticancer drugs are injected into the intrathecal space, which is the space that holds the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, shown in blue). There are two different ways to do this. One way, shown in the top part of the figure, is to inject the drugs into an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain). The other way, shown in the bottom part of the figure, is to inject the drugs directly into the CSF in the lower part of the spinal column, after a small area on the lower back is numbed.

When a pregnant woman is treated with chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the fetus cannot be protected from being exposed to chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy regimens may cause birth defects if given in the first trimester.

#### Immunotherapy

[Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient’s [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.

- [Immunomodulators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=739791&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): [Lenalidomide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=393761&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is an immunomodulator used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- CAR T-cell therapy: The patient's [T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a type of immune system cell) are changed so they will attack certain [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special [receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called [chimeric antigen receptor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787969&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy (such as [axicabtagene ciloleucel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [tisagenlecleucel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=790747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) is used to treat large [B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444967&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that has not [responded](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treatment. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied to treat [mantle cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445048&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that has [relapsed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or not responded to treatment.

CAR T-cell therapy. A type of treatment in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will bind to cancer cells and kill them. Blood from a vein in the patient’s arm flows through a tube to an apheresis machine (not shown), which removes the white blood cells, including the T cells, and sends the rest of the blood back to the patient. Then, the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. Millions of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and then given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells are able to bind to an antigen on the cancer cells and kill them.

#### Targeted therapy

Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. [Monoclonal
antibody](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [proteasome inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=393541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy, and [kinase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750798&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

- Monoclonal
antibody therapy: Monoclonal antibodies are [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They may be used alone or to carry drugs, [toxins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) material directly to cancer cells.

Types of monoclonal antibodies include:

- [Rituximab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- [Obinutuzumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754339&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), used to treat [follicular lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428287&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Mogamulizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=794274&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), used to treat certain types of [relapsed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [refractory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45863&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [T-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45924&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Tafasitamab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=802193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) combined with lenalidomide to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
- [Pembrolizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=764538&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treat [primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=777025&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Polatuzumab vedotin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), combined with [bendamustine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386197&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and rituximab to treat relapsed or refractory [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428286&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Brentuximab vedotin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=710543&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which contains a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called [CD30](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=796822&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is found on some lymphoma cells. It also contains an anticancer drug that may help kill cancer cells.
- [Yttrium Y 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an example of a [radiolabeled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45857&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) monoclonal antibody.
- [Mosunetuzumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=811230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is a [bispecific monoclonal antibody](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that helps the body's immune system recognize and kill cancer cells. It is used to treat relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.

How do monoclonal antibodies work to treat cancer? This video shows how monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, pembrolizumab, and rituximab, block molecules cancer cells need to grow, flag cancer cells for destruction by the body’s immune system, or deliver harmful substances to cancer cells.
- Proteasome inhibitor therapy: This treatment blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells. Proteasomes remove [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) no longer needed by the cell. When the proteasomes are blocked, the proteins build up in the cell and may cause the cancer cell to die. [Bortezomib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269133&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [ixazomib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=777065&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to decrease how much [immunoglobulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45725&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) M is in the blood after cancer treatment for [lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409750&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (Waldenström macroglobulinemia). It is also being studied to treat [relapsed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [mantle cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445048&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Kinase inhibitor therapy: This treatment blocks certain proteins, which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them. Kinase inhibitor therapies include:

- [Ibrutinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754851&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [acalabrutinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791334&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [zanubrutinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799967&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are types of Bruton [tyrosine kinase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44833&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy. They are used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are also used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and zanubrutinib is being studied to treat it.
- [Histone methyltransferase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=784255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy: [Tazemetostat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793179&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to treat follicular lymphoma that has come back or has not gotten better with other treatment. It is used in adults whose cancer has a certain [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (change) in the [EZH2 gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=801889&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that has already been treated with at least two other anticancer therapies.
- [B-cell lymphoma-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613899&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (BCL-2) inhibitor therapy: [Venetoclax](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=780268&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. It blocks the action of a protein called BCL-2 and may help kill cancer cells.

For more information, see [Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/non-hodgkin "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/non-hodgkin").

#### Plasmapheresis

If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects [circulation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [plasmapheresis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is done to remove extra [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure, blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with [donated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plasma or a plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.

#### Watchful waiting

[Watchful waiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45942&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is
closely [monitoring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) a patient’s [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment until
signs or symptoms appear or change.

#### Antibiotic therapy

[Antibiotic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45967&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat [infections](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and cancer caused by [bacteria](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [microorganisms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44059&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with [indolent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45588&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body:

- Local [excision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269459&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for certain patients with [mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44437&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), PTLD, and small bowel T-cell lymphoma.
- [Splenectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46594&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for patients with [marginal zone lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=543124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Patients who have a heart, [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. Long-term [immunosuppression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45727&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called [posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PLTD).

Small [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) surgery is often needed to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [celiac disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=377726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in adults who develop a type of T-cell lymphoma.

#### Stem cell transplant

Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation and then replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. [Stem cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46598&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or [bone marrow](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45622&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the patient ([autologous transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270733&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) or a [donor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([allogeneic transplant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270732&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body’s blood cells.

Donor stem cell transplant. (Step 1): Four to five days before donor stem cell collection, the donor receives a medicine to increase the number of stem cells circulating through their bloodstream (not shown). The blood-forming stem cells are then collected from the donor through a large vein in their arm. The blood flows through an apheresis machine that removes the stem cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a vein in their other arm. (Step 2): The patient receives chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and prepare their body for the donor stem cells. The patient may also receive radiation therapy (not shown). (Step 3): The patient receives an infusion of the donor stem cells.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
[NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

#### Vaccine therapy

[Vaccine therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386223&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and kill it.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
