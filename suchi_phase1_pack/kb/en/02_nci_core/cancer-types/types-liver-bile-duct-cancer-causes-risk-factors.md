# Bile Duct Cancer Causes and Risk Factors

Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. There are several risk factors associated with [bile duct cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527370&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not everyone with one or more of these risk factors will develop the disease, and the disease will develop in some people who don’t have any known risk factors. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor.

Risk factors for bile duct cancer include the following conditions:

- primary sclerosing cholangitis (a [progressive disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45850&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which the [bile ducts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) become blocked by [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and scarring)
- chronic [ulcerative colitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45493&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- [cysts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46461&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the bile ducts (cysts block the flow of [bile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46508&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and can cause swollen bile ducts, inflammation, and [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov))
- infection with a Chinese liver fluke [parasite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44310&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)

There are actions you can take that can help to decrease your risk of getting cancer. To learn more about ways to prevent cancer, see [Cancer Prevention Overview](/about-cancer/causes-prevention/patient-prevention-overview-pdq).
