- [Keto Molecule Offers Clue for Preventing Colorectal Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/keto-bhb-prevent-colorectal-cancer)

Posted: June 2, 2022

In a study in mice, researchers showed that BHB, a compound produced while eating a ketogenic diet, may slow or stop colorectal cancer from growing. More studies are needed, they warned, to see if BHB has similar effects in humans.
- [Colonoscopy after Positive FIT Test Cuts Risk of Colorectal Cancer Death](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/positive-fit-stool-test-colonoscopy)

Posted: May 5, 2022

People who had a positive FIT result (signs of blood in the stool) but didn’t get a follow-up colonoscopy were twice as likely to die of colorectal cancer as those who did get a colonoscopy, a new study found.
- [Does Too Much Fructose Help Colorectal Cancers Grow?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/fructose-promotes-obesity-colorectal-cancer)

Posted: October 29, 2021

Excess fructose can promote obesity and colorectal cancer, a new study shows. In mice, the study found that the sweetener, a component of table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, increased how long normal and cancer cells in the intestines live.
- [Pattern of DNA Damage Links Colorectal Cancer and Diet High in Red Meat](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/red-meat-colorectal-cancer-genetic-signature)

Posted: July 22, 2021

Researchers have discovered a consistent pattern of DNA damage in colorectal tumors that may explain how a diet high in red and processed meat can help cause colorectal cancer.
- [Should People Over Age 75 Be Screened for Colorectal Cancer?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/colorectal-cancer-screening-people-older-than-75)

Posted: June 15, 2021

Screening people for colorectal cancer after age 75 may be beneficial, a new study suggests. The findings provide helpful information for physicians to use in discussing screening choices with their older patients.
- [Texting May Help Reduce Disparities in Colorectal Cancer Screening](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/colorectal-cancer-screening-text-message-reduce-disparities)

Posted: March 19, 2021
