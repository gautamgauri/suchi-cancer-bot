## Overview

Neuroblastoma is a cancer of immature nerve cells that most often occurs in young children. It usually begins in the adrenal glands but can form in the neck, chest, abdomen, and spine. Explore the links on this page to learn more about neuroblastoma treatment, research, and clinical trials.
