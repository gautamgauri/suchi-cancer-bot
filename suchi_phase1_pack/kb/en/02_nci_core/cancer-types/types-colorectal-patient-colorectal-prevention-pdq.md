# Colorectal Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## What Is Prevention?

[Go to Health Professional Version](/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-prevention-pdq)

Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

To prevent new cancers from starting, [scientists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) look at [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor.

Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For
example, both smoking and inheriting certain [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are risk factors for some
types of cancer, but only smoking can be avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk, but it does
not mean that you will not get cancer.

Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:

- changing lifestyle or eating habits
- avoiding things known to cause cancer
- taking medicines to treat a [precancerous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) condition or to keep cancer from starting

## General Information About Colorectal Cancer

### Key Points

- Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer)
cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.
- Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from
cancer in the United States.

### Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.

The [colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is part of the body's [digestive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The digestive system removes and
processes [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [carbohydrates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fats, [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and
water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive
system is made up of the mouth, [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the
[small](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [large intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The colon (large [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [anal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44185&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6 to 8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the
anus (the opening of the large intestine to
the outside of the body). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415499.jpg)![Gastrointestinal (digestive) system anatomy; drawing shows the esophagus, liver, stomach, colon, small intestine, rectum, and anus.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415499-750.jpg "Gastrointestinal (digestive) system anatomy; drawing shows the esophagus, liver, stomach, colon, small intestine, rectum, and anus.")

Anatomy of the lower gastrointestinal (digestive) system showing the colon, rectum, and anus. Other organs that make up the digestive system are also shown.

Cancer that begins in the colon is called [colon cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and cancer
that begins in the rectum is called [rectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=529764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer that affects either of
these organs may also be called [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Other [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summaries containing information related to colorectal cancer include:

### Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States when numbers for men and women are combined. Between 2012 and 2021, the number of new colorectal cancer cases in the United States decreased. This decline was largely driven by falling rates in adults aged 65 and older, who continue to have the highest overall rates of colorectal cancer. The drop in older adults may be due in part to increased colorectal cancer screening, which can detect and remove precancerous growths before they develop into cancer. However, trends vary by age group. Among adults younger than 50, the number of new cases of colorectal cancer rose by about 2.4% per year, the largest increase among all age groups. In people aged 50 to 64, the number of new cases increased slightly per year.

Since 1970, the death rate from colorectal cancer has declined in men and women. However, new cases and deaths from colorectal cancer remain higher among Black people than other racial groups. Studies show that Black people are not more likely than others to have precancerous growths.

Finding and treating colorectal cancer early may prevent death from colorectal cancer. [Screening tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810044&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to help find colorectal cancer.

### Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.

Avoiding [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having [overweight](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and not getting enough exercise. Increasing [protective factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439422&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.

### The following *risk* factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer:

#### Age

The risk of colorectal cancer increases after age 50. Most cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed after age 50.

#### Family history of colorectal cancer

Having a parent, brother, sister, or child with colorectal cancer doubles a person's risk of colorectal cancer.

#### Personal history

Having a [personal history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the following conditions increases the risk of colorectal cancer:

- previous colorectal cancer
- high-risk [adenomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (colorectal [polyps](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45844&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are 1 [centimeter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or larger in size or that have cells that look [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) under a microscope)
- [ovarian cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445074&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- [inflammatory bowel disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (such as [ulcerative colitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45493&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [Crohn disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45661&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov))

#### Inherited risk

The risk of colorectal cancer is increased when certain [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) changes linked to [familial adenomatous polyposis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FAP) or [hereditary nonpolyposis colon
cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44884&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HNPCC or Lynch Syndrome) are [inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Alcohol

Drinking 3 or more [alcoholic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) beverages per day increases the risk of
colorectal cancer. Drinking alcohol is also linked to the risk of forming large colorectal [adenomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (benign tumors).

#### Cigarette smoking

Cigarette smoking is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.

Smoking cigarettes is also linked to an increased risk of
forming colorectal adenomas. Cigarette smokers who have had surgery to remove colorectal adenomas are at an increased risk for the adenomas to [recur](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).

#### Race

Black individuals have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races.

#### Obesity

[Obesity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.

### The following *protective* factors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer:

#### Physical activity

A lifestyle that includes regular physical activity is linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.

#### Aspirin

Studies have shown that taking aspirin daily for at least two years lowers the risk of colorectal cancer and the risk of death from colorectal cancer. The decrease in risk begins 10 to 20 years after patients start taking aspirin.

The possible harms of aspirin use (100 mg or less) daily or every other day include an increased risk of stroke and bleeding in the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These risks may be greater among the elderly, men, and those with conditions linked to a higher-than-normal risk of bleeding.

#### Combination hormone replacement therapy

[Studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have shown that combination [hormone replacement therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46127&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (HRT) that includes both [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [progestin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lowers the risk of [invasive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45741&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [postmenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women.

However, in women who take combination HRT and do develop colorectal cancer, the cancer is more likely to be [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when it is diagnosed and the risk of dying from colorectal cancer is not decreased.

The possible harms of combination HRT include an increased risk of:

- [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- heart disease
- [blood clots](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476017&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)

#### Polyp removal

Most colorectal polyps are adenomas, which may develop into cancer. Removing colorectal polyps that are larger than 1 [centimeter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=354457&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (pea-sized) may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. It is not known if removing smaller polyps lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.

The possible harms of polyp removal during [colonoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45648&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [sigmoidoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45880&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include a tear in the wall of the [colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bleeding.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415500.jpg)![Colon polyps; shows two polyps (one flat and one pedunculated) inside the colon. Inset shows photo of a pedunculated polyp.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/415500-750.jpg "Colon polyps; shows two polyps (one flat and one pedunculated) inside the colon. Inset shows photo of a pedunculated polyp.")

Polyps in the colon. Some polyps have a stalk and others do not. Inset shows a photo of a polyp with a stalk.

### It is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer:

#### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) other than aspirin

It is not known if the use of [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44481&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or NSAIDs (such as [sulindac](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45372&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [celecoxib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45969&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [naproxen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [ibuprofen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613511&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.

Studies have shown that taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas (benign tumors) coming back after they have been removed. It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.

Taking sulindac or celecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of polyps that form in the colon and [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of people with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.

The possible harms of NSAIDs include:

- [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems
- bleeding in the stomach, intestines, or brain
- heart problems such as heart attack and [congestive heart failure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45143&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)

#### Calcium

It is not known if taking [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.

#### Diet

It is not known if a [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) low in fat and meat and high in [fiber](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fruits, and vegetables lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.

Some studies have shown that a diet high in fat, [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [calories](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44651&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer, but other studies have not.

### The following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer:

#### Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only does not lower the risk of having invasive colorectal cancer or the risk of dying from colorectal cancer.

#### Statins

Studies have shown that taking [statins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390255&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that lower [cholesterol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) does not increase or decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.

### Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.

Cancer prevention [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials include healthy people who may or may not have an increased risk of cancer. Other prevention trials include people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent recurrence or a second cancer.

The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or food [supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### New ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

Information about [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supported by [NCI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44267&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about colorectal cancer prevention. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/screening-prevention").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
