# Bladder Cancer Symptoms

The symptoms of [bladder cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444968&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can vary from person to person. The most common symptom is blood in the urine, called hematuria. It’s often slightly rusty to bright red in color. You may see blood in your urine at one point, then not see it again for a while. Sometimes there are very small amounts of blood in the urine that can only be found by having a test done.

Other common symptoms of bladder cancer include

- frequent urination
- pain or burning during urination
- feeling as if you need to urinate even if your bladder isn’t full
- urinating often during the night

When the cancer has grown large or spread beyond the bladder to other parts of the body, symptoms may include

- being unable to urinate
- lower back pain on one side of the body
- pain in the abdomen
- bone pain or tenderness
- unintended weight loss and loss of appetite
- swelling in the feet
- feeling tired

It’s important to check with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. Keep in mind that [urinary tract infections](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=800915&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), kidney or bladder stones, or other problems related to the [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) could be the cause, not cancer. Your doctor will ask you when your symptoms started and how often you’re having them. They will most likely ask you to give a urine sample as a first step in diagnosing what is causing your symptoms.
