FDA’s recent approval of relugolix (Orgovyx) is expected to affect the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. A large clinical trial showed that relugolix was more effective at reducing testosterone levels than another common treatment.
- [With Two FDA Approvals, Prostate Cancer Treatment Enters the PARP Era](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/fda-olaparib-rucaparib-prostate-cancer)

Posted: June 11, 2020

FDA has approved olaparib (Lynparza) and rucaparib (Rubraca) to treat some men with metastatic prostate cancer. The PARP inhibitors are approved for men whose cancers have stopped responding to hormone treatment and have specific genetic alterations.
- [PSMA PET-CT Accurately Detects Prostate Cancer Spread, Trial Shows](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/prostate-cancer-psma-pet-ct-metastasis)

Posted: May 11, 2020

For some men with prostate cancer at high risk of spreading, a large clinical trial shows an imaging method called PSMA PET-CT is more likely to detect metastatic tumors than the standard imaging approach used in many countries.
- [Testing with Combined Biopsy Method Improves Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in NCI Study](/news-events/press-releases/2020/combined-prostate-biopsy)

Posted: March 4, 2020
