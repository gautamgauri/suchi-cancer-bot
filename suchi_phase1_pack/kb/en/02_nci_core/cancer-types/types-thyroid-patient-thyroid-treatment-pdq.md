### Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the thyroid gland.

The [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at the base of the [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the [trachea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46623&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (windpipe). It is shaped like a butterfly, with a right [lobe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46188&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and a left lobe. The [isthmus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44549&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a thin piece of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), connects the two lobes. A healthy thyroid is a little larger than a quarter. It usually cannot be felt through the skin.

An inset shows the front and back views. The front view shows that the thyroid is shaped like a butterfly, with the right lobe and left lobe connected by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. The back view shows the four pea-sized parathyroid glands. The larynx is also shown.")

Anatomy of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland lies at the base of the throat near the trachea. It is shaped like a butterfly, with the right lobe and left lobe connected by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized organs found in the neck near the thyroid. The thyroid and parathyroid glands make hormones.

The thyroid uses [iodine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44548&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a [mineral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found in some foods and in iodized salt, to help make several [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Thyroid hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44558&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) do the following:

- Control [heart rate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), body temperature, and how quickly food is changed into energy ([metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- Control the amount of [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Thyroid nodules are common but usually are not cancer.

Your doctor may find a lump ([nodule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44502&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in your thyroid during a routine medical exam. A thyroid nodule is an [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) growth of thyroid [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the thyroid. Nodules may be solid or [fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-filled.

When a thyroid nodule is found, an [ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)  of the thyroid and a [fine-needle aspiration biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45691&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are often done to check for [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Blood tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688783&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check thyroid hormone levels and for antithyroid [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may also be done to check for other types of thyroid disease.

Thyroid nodules usually don't cause [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or need treatment. Sometimes the thyroid nodules become large enough that it is hard to swallow or breathe and more tests and treatment are needed. Only a small number of thyroid nodules are [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as cancer.

### There are different types of thyroid cancer.

[Thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445091&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be described as either:

- Differentiated thyroid cancer, which includes [well-differentiated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774690&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), poorly differentiated tumors, and [undifferentiated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44775&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumors; *or*
- [Medullary thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Well-differentiated tumors ([papillary thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44553&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [follicular thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44544&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) can be treated and can usually be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumors ([anaplastic thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are less common. These tumors grow and spread quickly and have a poorer chance of recovery. Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer should have [molecular testing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=766166&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for a [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the *[BRAF](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Medullary thyroid cancer is a [neuroendocrine tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44904&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that develops in [C cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44578&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the thyroid. The C cells make a [hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([calcitonin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45207&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) that helps maintain a healthy level of [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

For information about childhood thyroid cancer, see [Childhood Thyroid Cancer Treatment](/types/thyroid/patient/child-thyroid-treatment-pdq).

### Age, sex, and being exposed to radiation can affect the risk of thyroid cancer.

Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.

Risk factors for thyroid cancer include the following:

- Being between 25 and 65 years old.
- Being female.
- Being exposed to [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the head and neck as an infant or child or being exposed to [radioactive fallout](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The cancer may occur as soon as 5 years after exposure.
- Having a [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [goiter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44545&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (enlarged thyroid).
- Having a [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of thyroid disease or thyroid cancer.
- Having certain [genetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46391&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as [familial medullary thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=563950&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FMTC), [multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=702095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (MEN2A), or [multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=702100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (MEN2B).
- Being Asian.

### Medullary thyroid cancer is sometimes caused by a change in a gene that is passed from parent to child.

The [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in cells carry [hereditary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information from parent to child. A certain change in the *RET* gene that is passed from parent to child ([inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) may cause medullary thyroid cancer.

There is a [genetic test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46128&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is used to check for the changed gene. The patient is tested first to see if he or she has the changed gene. If the patient has it, other family members may also be tested to find out if they are at increased risk for medullary thyroid cancer. Family members, including young children, who have the changed gene may have a [thyroidectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44557&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the thyroid). This can decrease the chance of developing medullary thyroid cancer.

### Signs of thyroid cancer include a swelling or lump in the neck.

Thyroid cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a routine [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Signs or symptoms may occur as the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) gets bigger. Other conditions may cause the same signs or symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:

- A lump (nodule) in the neck.
- Trouble breathing.
- Trouble swallowing.
- Pain when swallowing.
- Hoarseness.

### Tests that examine the thyroid, neck, and blood are used to diagnose thyroid cancer.

The following tests and procedures may be used:

- **Physical exam and [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps (nodules) or swelling in the neck, [voice box](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=520366&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
- **[Laryngoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46321&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)** :A procedure in which the doctor checks the [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (voice box) with a mirror or a [laryngoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46320&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
A laryngoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. A thyroid tumor may press on [vocal cords](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The laryngoscopy is done to see if the vocal cords are moving normally.
- **Blood hormone studies**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. The blood may be checked for abnormal levels of [thyroid-stimulating hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TSH). TSH is made by the [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It stimulates the release of thyroid hormone and controls how fast follicular thyroid cells grow.
The blood may also be checked for high levels of the hormone [calcitonin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45207&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and antithyroid antibodies.
- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- **[Ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam**: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a thyroid nodule and whether it is solid or a fluid-filled [cyst](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46461&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Ultrasound may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/753850.jpg)![Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/753850-750.jpg "Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck; drawing shows a patient lying on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.")

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
- **Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid**: The removal of thyroid tissue using a thin needle. The needle is inserted through the skin into the thyroid. Several tissue samples are removed from different parts of the thyroid. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) views the tissue samples under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to look for cancer cells. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have [biopsy samples](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45619&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer.
- **[Surgical biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=563951&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of the thyroid [nodule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44502&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or one lobe of the thyroid during [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) so the cells and tissues can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have biopsy samples checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following:

- The age of the patient at the time of diagnosis.
- The type of thyroid cancer.
- The [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer.
- Whether the cancer was completely removed by surgery.
- Whether the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B).
- The patient's general health.
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).

## Stages of Thyroid Cancer

### Key Points

- After thyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out
if cancer cells have spread within the thyroid or to other parts of the body.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- Stages are used to describe thyroid cancer based on the type of thyroid cancer and the age of the patient:
- Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer in patients younger than 55 years
- Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer in patients 55 years and older
- Anaplastic thyroid cancer in patients of all ages
- Medullary thyroid cancer in patients of all ages
- Thyroid cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### After thyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the thyroid or to other parts of the body.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or
to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The information gathered from the
staging process determines the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease. It is important to know
the patient's age and the stage of the cancer to plan treatment.

The following tests and
procedures may be used in the staging process:

- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [brain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[Ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exam**: Aprocedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The picture can be printed to be looked at later.
- **[Chest x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
- **[Bone scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) material is [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Sentinel lymph node biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46712&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of the [sentinel lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45876&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) during [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The sentinel lymph node is the first [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in a group of lymph nodes to receive [lymphatic drainage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45760&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The substance or dye flows through the [lymph](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46305&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [ducts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46441&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) views the tissue under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if [thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445091&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) spreads to the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the lung are actually thyroid cancer cells. The disease is metastatic thyroid cancer, not lung cancer.

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### Stages are used to describe thyroid cancer based on the type of thyroid cancer and the age of the patient:

### There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with [thyroid
cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445091&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some
are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help
improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
standard treatment, the new
treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the most common treatment for thyroid cancer. One of the following procedures may be used:

- [Lobectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46314&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Removal of the [lobe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46188&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which thyroid cancer is found. [Lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs of cancer.
- Near-total [thyroidectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44557&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Removal of all but a very small part of the [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Lymph nodes near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
- Total thyroidectomy: Removal of the whole thyroid. Lymph nodes near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
- [Tracheostomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46625&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to create an opening ([stoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45104&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) into the [windpipe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44379&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help you breathe. The opening itself may also be called a tracheostomy.

#### Radiation therapy, including radioactive iodine therapy

[Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:

- [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Sometimes the radiation is aimed directly at the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) during surgery. This is called [intraoperative radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46338&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Internal radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substance sealed in needles, [seeds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257219&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), wires, or [catheters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are placed directly into or near the cancer.

Radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill any thyroid cancer cells that were not removed. [Follicular](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44544&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [papillary thyroid cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44553&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are sometimes treated with [radioactive iodine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45855&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (RAI) therapy. RAI is taken by mouth and collects in any remaining thyroid [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including thyroid cancer cells that have spread to other places in the body. Since only thyroid tissue takes up [iodine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44548&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the RAI destroys thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer cells without harming other tissue. Before a full treatment [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of RAI is given, a small test-dose is given to see if the tumor takes up the iodine.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy are used to treat thyroid cancer.

#### Chemotherapy

[Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

See [Drugs Approved for Thyroid Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/thyroid "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/thyroid") for more information.

#### Thyroid hormone therapy

[Hormone therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that removes [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. In the treatment of thyroid cancer, drugs may be given to prevent the body from making [thyroid-stimulating hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TSH), a hormone that can increase the chance that thyroid cancer will grow or [recur](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Also, because thyroid cancer treatment kills thyroid cells, the thyroid is not able to make enough [thyroid hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44558&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Patients are given [thyroid hormone replacement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46127&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pills.

#### Targeted therapy

[Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. There are different types of targeted therapy:

- **[Tyrosine kinase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44833&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow. [Sorafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509041&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lenvatinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=769612&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [vandetanib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=530320&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cabozantinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=743915&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [selpercatinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=801614&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [larotrectinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=795811&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [entrectinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=784260&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [pralsetinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=802446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to treat certain types of thyroid cancer. New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied to treat [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) thyroid cancer.
- **[Protein kinase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=486603&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).** Protein kinase inhibitor therapy blocks [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells. [Dabrafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750069&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [trametinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to treat [anaplastic thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44541&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in patients with a certain [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the *[BRAF](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

See [Drugs Approved for Thyroid Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/thyroid "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/thyroid") for more information.

#### Watchful waiting

[Watchful waiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45942&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is closely [monitoring](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) a patient’s [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without giving any treatment until [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) appear or change.

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

#### Immunotherapy

[Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient’s [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of [biologic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45617&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Immunotherapy is being studied as a treatment for thyroid cancer.

Information about clinical trials is available from the
[NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for thyroid cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of adult thyroid cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
