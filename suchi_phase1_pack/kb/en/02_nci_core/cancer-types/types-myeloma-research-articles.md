- [FDA Approvals Expand Initial Treatment Options for Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2025/fda-daratumumab-isatuximab-newly-diagnosed-myeloma)

Posted: January 7, 2025

FDA’s approvals of Darzalex Faspro and Sarclisa, each used in combination with standard three-drug treatment regimens, should change the initial treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including for patients who can’t get a stem cell transplant.

Posted: January 19, 2024

Adding daratumumab (Darzalex) to standard treatment helped people with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma live longer without their cancer getting worse or dying. People taking daratumumab were also more likely to have no detectable signs of cancer (minimal residual disease) after treatment.
- [Motixafortide May Improve Stem Cell Transplants for People with Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/motixafortide-multiple-myeloma-stem-cell-transplant)

Posted: May 23, 2023

In a clinical trial of people with multiple myeloma, giving motixafortide with filgrastim markedly increased the number of stem cells that could be collected. The treatment may allow more people with this cancer to get optimal numbers of stem cells for a transplant.
- [Teclistamab Shows Promise for People with Heavily Pretreated Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/tecvayli-multiple-myeloma)

Posted: September 29, 2022

In a small clinical trial, nearly 40% of people with multiple myeloma who were treated with the immunotherapy drug teclistamab (Tecvayli) had all signs of their cancer disappear. The trial participants had myeloma that did not respond to or came back after three or more prior treatments.
- [Carvykti Approval Marks Second CAR T-Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/fda-carvykti-multiple-myeloma)

Posted: March 30, 2022

People with advanced multiple myeloma now have another option for CAR T-cell therapy with the recent approval of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti). Like the first approved CAR T-cell therapy, Carvykti targets the BCMA protein on myeloma cells.
- [COVID-19 Vaccines May Be Less Effective in Some People with Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/covid-vaccine-limited-protection-in-cancer-patients)

Posted: May 27, 2021

People with blood cancers seem to be less protected by COVID-19 vaccines than those with other cancers and people without cancer, three new studies suggest. Experts believe this limited effectiveness is likely due to patients’ weakened immune systems.
- [FDA Approves BCMA-Targeted CAR T-Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/fda-ide-cel-car-t-multiple-myeloma)

Posted: April 14, 2021

The Food and Drug Administration has approved idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) for some people with multiple myeloma. The approval is based, in part, on a small study in which ide-cel partially or completely shrank tumors in 72% of patients.
- [Study Explores Jaw Problem Linked to Zoledronic Acid, Finds Risk Factors](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/jaw-osteonecrosis-zoledronic-acid)

Posted: January 28, 2021

A recent study quantified the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw for patients who take zoledronic acid to manage complications from cancer that has spread to the bone. The study also examined risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw in these patients.
- [Failed Alzheimer’s Drug Might Boost CAR T-Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/myeloma-car-t-cell-bcma-alzheimers)

Posted: October 25, 2019

Results from a new study suggest a potential way to improve the effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma. The approach relies on a class of drugs called gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), several of which have been studied to treat Alzheimer’s disease.
- [MGUS to Myeloma: Study Suggests Risk of Progression Can Change](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/mgus-multiple-myeloma-progression-risk)

Posted: August 13, 2019

A person’s risk of progressing from a benign condition called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to the blood cancer multiple myeloma can change over time, according to a new study.
- [Drug Shows Promise in Slowing Progression of Smoldering Myeloma to Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/lenalidomide-slows-progression-smoldering-myeloma)

Posted: June 7, 2019

The drug lenalidomide (Revlimid) may delay the progression of smoldering myeloma to multiple myeloma, according to preliminary results from a clinical trial.
- [CAR T Cells: Expanding into Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/car-t-cell-multiple-myeloma)

Posted: June 12, 2017

Results from two early-phase trials presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting suggest that an immunotherapy using genetically engineered immune cells may be effective in patients with advanced multiple myeloma.
- [FDA Approves New Use for Lenalidomide in Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/fda-lenalidomide-myeloma-maintenance)

Posted: March 16, 2017

The FDA has approved lenalidomide for use as a maintenance therapy in patients with multiple myeloma who have undergone an autologous stem cell transplant, to help keep the cancer from coming back.
- [Three-Drug Combination Extends Survival for Patients with Multiple Myeloma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/three-drug-combination-myeloma)

Posted: February 10, 2017

A phase III clinical trial demonstrates that adding the drug bortezomib to a commonly used two-drug regimen extends survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
- [Daratumumab Improves Progression-Free Survival for Patients with Multiple Myeloma](/types/myeloma/research/daratumumab-castor-pollux)

Posted: January 4, 2017

Results from a phase III trial showed that adding daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone improved progression-free survival among patients with relapsed or refractory disease, compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.
