### Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormone-making cells (islet cells) of the pancreas.

The [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and in front of the [spine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/636528.jpg)![Anatomy of the pancreas; drawing shows the pancreas, stomach, spleen, liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, small intestine, and colon. An inset shows the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. The bile duct and pancreatic duct are also shown.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/636528-750.jpg "Anatomy of the pancreas; drawing shows the pancreas, stomach, spleen, liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, small intestine, and colon. An inset shows the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. The bile duct and pancreatic duct are also shown.")

Anatomy of the pancreas. The pancreas has three areas: the head, body, and tail. It is found in the abdomen near the stomach, intestines, and other organs.

There are two kinds of [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the pancreas:

- **[Endocrine pancreas cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270854&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)** make several kinds of [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body), such as [insulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46187&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to control [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called [islet cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270855&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or islets of Langerhans. [Tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that form in islet cells are called [islet cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=573196&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).
- **[Exocrine pancreas cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270856&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)** make [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are released into the [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help the body [digest](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463707&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) food. Most of the pancreas is made of [ducts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46441&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with [exocrine cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270856&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas. See the [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summary on [Pancreatic Cancer Treatment](/types/pancreatic/patient/pancreatic-treatment-pdq) for information on [exocrine pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be [benign](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45614&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (not [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) or [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cancer). When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called [pancreatic endocrine cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=530385&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or islet cell carcinoma.

Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Pancreatic NETs may or may not cause signs or symptoms.

Pancreatic NETs may be [functional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458094&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [nonfunctional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Functional tumors make extra amounts of hormones, such as [gastrin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458101&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), insulin, and [glucagon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270860&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), that cause [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Nonfunctional tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones. Signs and symptoms are caused by the tumor as it spreads and grows.
Most nonfunctional tumors are [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cancer).

Most pancreatic NETs are functional tumors.

### There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.

Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon. Functional pancreatic NETs include the following:

- **[Gastrinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44239&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):** A tumor that forms in cells that make gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone that causes the stomach to release an [acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642987&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that helps digest food. Both gastrin and stomach acid are increased by gastrinomas. When increased [stomach acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657842&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), stomach [ulcers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are caused by a tumor that makes gastrin, it is called [Zollinger-Ellison syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44262&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A gastrinoma usually forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine. Most gastrinomas are malignant (cancer).
- **[Insulinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657853&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):** A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar) in the blood. It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy. Insulinomas are usually slow-growing tumors that rarely spread. An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Insulinomas are usually benign (not cancer).
- **[Glucagonoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44280&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):** A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood. It causes the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to break down glycogen. Too much glucagon causes [hyperglycemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44208&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([high blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas. Most glucagonomas are malignant (cancer).
- **Other types of tumors**: There are other rare types of functional pancreatic NETs that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body. These tumors include:

- VIPomas, which make [vasoactive intestinal peptide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658067&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome.
- Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin.

These other types of tumors are grouped together because they are treated in much the same way.

### Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs.

Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called
a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Having a risk factor does not mean that you will
get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will
not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.

[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a risk factor for pancreatic NETs.

### Different types of pancreatic NETs have different signs and symptoms.

Signs or symptoms can be caused by the growth of the tumor and/or by hormones the tumor makes or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some tumors may not cause signs or symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.

**Signs and symptoms of a non-functional pancreatic NET**

A non-functional pancreatic NET may grow for a long time without causing signs or symptoms. It may grow large or spread to other parts of the body before it causes signs or symptoms, such as:

- Diarrhea.
- Indigestion.
- A lump in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Pain in the abdomen or back.
- Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.

**Signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET**

The signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET depend on the type of hormone being made.

**Too much gastrin may cause:**

- Stomach ulcers that keep coming back.
- Pain in the abdomen, which may spread to the back. The pain may come and go and it may go away after taking an antacid.
- The flow of stomach contents back into the [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([gastroesophageal reflux](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257517&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- Diarrhea.

**Too much insulin may cause:**

- Low [blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can cause blurred vision, headache, and feeling lightheaded, tired, weak, shaky, nervous, irritable, sweaty, confused, or hungry.
- Fast heartbeat.

**Too much glucagon may cause:**

- Skin rash on the face, stomach, or legs.
- High blood sugar. This can cause headaches, frequent [urination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), dry skin and mouth, or feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, or weak.
- [Blood clots](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476017&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Blood clots in the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can cause shortness of breath, cough, or pain in the chest. Blood clots in the arm or leg can cause pain, swelling, warmth, or redness of the arm or leg.
- Diarrhea.
- Weight loss for no known reason.
- Sore tongue or sores at the corners of the mouth.

**Too much vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may cause:**

- Very large amounts of watery diarrhea.
- [Dehydration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44659&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can cause feeling thirsty, making less [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), dry skin and mouth, headaches, dizziness, or feeling tired.
- Low [potassium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44344&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level in the blood. This can cause muscle weakness, aching, or cramps, numbness and tingling, frequent urination, fast heartbeat, and feeling confused or thirsty.
- Cramps or pain in the abdomen.
- Weight loss for no known reason.

**Too much somatostatin may cause:**

- High blood sugar. This can cause headaches, frequent urination, dry skin and mouth, or feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, or weak.
- Diarrhea.
- Steatorrhea (very foul-smelling [stool](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46605&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that floats).
- [Gallstones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.
- Weight loss for no known reason.

A pancreatic NET may also make too much [adrenocorticotropic hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ACTH) and cause [Cushing syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=626500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome include the following:

- Headache.
- Some loss of vision.
- Weight gain in the face, neck, and [trunk](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=796908&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the body, and thin arms and legs.
- A lump of fat on the back of the neck.
- Thin skin that may have purple or pink stretch marks on the chest or abdomen.
- Easy bruising.
- Growth of fine hair on the face, upper back, or arms.
- Bones that break easily.
- Sores or cuts that heal slowly.
- [Anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), irritability, and [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The treatment of pancreatic NETs that make too much ACTH and Cushing syndrome are not discussed in this summary.

### Lab tests and imaging tests are used to diagnose pancreatic NETs.

The following tests and procedures may be used:

- **[Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as glucose (sugar), released into the blood by organs and [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- **[Chromogranin A](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=721302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) test**: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of chromogranin A in the blood. A higher than normal amount of chromogranin A and normal amounts of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon can be a sign of a non-functional pancreatic NET.
- **[Abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an [x-ray](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
- **[Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390250&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**:
A type of [radionuclide scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46552&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [octreotide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45141&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS.
- **[Endoscopic ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46602&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (EUS)**: A procedure in which an [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves ([ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a [sonogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This procedure is also called endosonography.
- **[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ERCP)**: A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry [bile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46508&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the liver to the [gallbladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing [jaundice](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46328&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An endoscope is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A [catheter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts. A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or [stent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44903&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken and checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs of cancer.
- **[Angiogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46530&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the flow of blood. A [contrast dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is injected into the blood vessel. As the contrast dye moves through the blood vessel, x-rays are taken to see if there are any blockages.
- **[Laparotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) procedure in which an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs of disease.
- **[Intraoperative ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657859&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure that uses high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) to create images of internal organs or tissues during surgery. A transducer placed directly on the organ or tissue is used to make the sound waves, which create echoes. The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms.
- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic NETs. Cells may be removed using a fine or wide needle inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or ultrasound. Tissue may also be removed during a [laparoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen).
- **[Bone scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in bones with cancer and is detected by a [scanner](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386220&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic NETs.

The following tests and procedures may be used:

**Gastrinoma**

- **Fasting [serum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44088&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) gastrin test**: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of gastrin in the blood. This test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. Conditions other than gastrinoma can cause an increase in the amount of gastrin in the blood.
- **Basal acid output test**: A test to measure the amount of acid made by the stomach. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. A tube is inserted through the nose or [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), into the stomach. The stomach contents are removed and four samples of gastric acid are removed through the tube. These samples are used to find out the amount of gastric acid made during the test and the [pH](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=747897&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level of the [gastric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [secretions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643082&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Secretin stimulation test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: If the basal acid output test result is not normal, a secretin stimulation test may be done. The tube is moved into the small intestine and samples are taken from the small intestine after a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [secretin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658055&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is injected. Secretin causes the small intestine to make acid. When there is a gastrinoma, the secretin causes an increase in how much gastric acid is made and the level of gastrin in the blood.
- **Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy**:
A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS.

**Insulinoma**

- **Fasting serum glucose and insulin test**: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of glucose (sugar) and insulin in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 24 hours.

**Glucagonoma**

- **Fasting serum glucagon test**: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of glucagon in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours.

**Other tumor types**

- VIPoma

- **Serum [VIP](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658069&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (vasoactive intestinal peptide) test**: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of VIP.
- **Blood chemistry studies**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. In VIPoma, there is a lower than normal amount of potassium.
- **Stool [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A stool sample is checked for a higher than normal [sodium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44731&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (salt) and potassium levels.
- Somatostatinoma

- **Fasting serum somatostatin test**: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of somatostatin in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours.
- **Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy**:
A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS.

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

Pancreatic NETs can often be [cured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following:

- The type of cancer cell.
- Where the tumor is found in the pancreas.
- Whether the tumor has spread to more than one place in the pancreas or to other parts of the body.
- Whether the patient has MEN1 syndrome.
- The patient's age and general health.
- Whether the cancer has just been [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (come back).

## Stages of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

### Key Points

- The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- Pancreatic NETs can recur (come back) after they have been treated.

### The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread.

The process used to find out if [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread within the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or to other parts of the body is called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The results of the tests and procedures used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=753531&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NETs) are also used to find out whether the cancer has spread. See the [General Information](/types/pancreatic/patient/pnet-treatment-pdq#_17) section for a description of these tests and procedures.

Although there is a standard [staging system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for pancreatic NETs, it is not used to plan treatment. Treatment of pancreatic NETs is based on the following:

- Whether the cancer is found in one place in the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Whether the cancer is found in several places in the pancreas.
- Whether the cancer has spread to [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the pancreas or to other parts of the body such as the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or bone.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually neuroendocrine tumor cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, not liver cancer.

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### Pancreatic NETs can recur (come back) after they have been treated.

The tumors may come back in the pancreas or in other parts of the body.

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs.
- The following types of treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization
- Targeted therapy
- Supportive care
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
trials.
- Treatment for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a
clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or
after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs.

Different types of
treatments are available for patients with [pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=753531&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NETs). Some
treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and
some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical
trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current
treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When clinical trials show that a new treatment is
better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may
become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about
taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open
only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

An operation may be done to remove the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). One of the following types of [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used:

- [Enucleation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335065&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the tumor only. This may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Pancreatoduodenectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=717157&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the [gallbladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), nearby [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and part of the [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [bile duct](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make [digestive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463707&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) juices and [insulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46187&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) removed during this procedure depend on the patient's [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is also called the [Whipple procedure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46653&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Distal pancreatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the body and tail of the
pancreas. The [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may also be removed if cancer has spread to the spleen.
- Total [gastrectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46397&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove the whole stomach.
- [Parietal cell vagotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to cut the [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that causes stomach [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to make [acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657842&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [resection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46565&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove part or all of the liver.
- [Radiofrequency ablation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44865&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only [local anesthesia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This is done in the hospital with [general anesthesia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44561&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Cryosurgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [ablation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335061&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A procedure in which [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is frozen to destroy [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells. This is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid [carbon dioxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538147&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The instrument may be used during surgery or [laparoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or inserted through the skin. This procedure is also called [cryoablation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=518326&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Chemotherapy

[Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the [cerebrospinal fluid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46483&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), an organ, or a body [cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas ([regional chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). [Combination chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.

#### Hormone therapy

[Hormone therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that removes [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by [glands](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach ([receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), drugs, surgery, or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.

#### Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization

[Hepatic arterial occlusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458102&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses drugs, small particles, or other agents to block or reduce the flow of [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the liver through the [hepatic artery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44563&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the major [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that carries blood to the liver). This is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver.
The tumor is prevented from getting the [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the [hepatic portal vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which carries blood from the stomach and [intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called [chemoembolization](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a [catheter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (thin tube). The drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the [artery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.

The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery.

#### Targeted therapy

[Targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic NETs.

#### Supportive care

[Supportive care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46609&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for pancreatic NETs may include treatment for the following:

- Stomach [ulcers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be treated with drug [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as:

- [Proton pump inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691415&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) drugs such as [omeprazole](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [lansoprazole](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691418&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or pantoprazole.
- Histamine blocking drugs such as [cimetidine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), ranitidine, or famotidine.
- Somatostatin-type drugs such as [octreotide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45141&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be treated with:

- [Intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (IV) [fluids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [electrolytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44338&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as [potassium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44344&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or chloride.
- Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide.
- Low [blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with [drug therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651195&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to maintain a normal blood sugar level.
- [High blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597245&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or [insulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46187&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about clinical trials is available from the
[NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Treatment for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## Treatment of Gastrinoma

For information about the treatments listed below, see the [Treatment Option Overview](/types/pancreatic/patient/pnet-treatment-pdq#_47) section.

Treatment of [gastrinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44239&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include [supportive care](/types/pancreatic/patient/pnet-treatment-pdq#_203) and the following:

- For [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by too much [stomach acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=657842&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), treatment may be a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that decreases the amount of acid made by the stomach.
- For a single [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the head of the [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to remove the tumor.
- Surgery to cut the [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that causes stomach [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to make acid and treatment with a drug that decreases stomach acid.
- Surgery to remove the whole stomach (rare).
- For a single tumor in the body or tail of the pancreas, treatment is usually surgery to remove the body or tail of the
pancreas.
- For several tumors in the pancreas, treatment is usually surgery to remove the body or tail of the
pancreas. If tumor remains after surgery, treatment may include either:

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors). It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
