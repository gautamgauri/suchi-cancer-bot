# Bladder Cancer Stages - NCI

# Bladder Cancer Stages

Cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It’s important to know the stage of [bladder cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444968&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to plan treatment.

There are several different [staging systems](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689095&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for cancer. Bladder cancer is usually staged using the [TNM staging system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=672851&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Your cancer may be described by this staging system in your [pathology report](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44702&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Based on the TNM results, a stage is assigned to your cancer, such as stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV (may also be written as stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, or stage 4). When talking with you about your cancer, your doctor may describe it as one of these stages.

The second inset shows stage 0is (also called carcinoma in situ) on the inner lining of the bladder. Also shown are the connective tissue and muscle layers of the bladder and the layer of fat around the bladder.")

Stage 0 bladder cancer (noninvasive bladder cancer). Cancer cells are found in tissue lining the inside of the bladder but have not invaded into the bladder wall. Stage 0a (also called noninvasive papillary carcinoma) may look like long, thin growths extending into the bladder lumen (the space where urine collects). Stage 0is (also called carcinoma in situ) is a flat tumor on the tissue lining the inside of the bladder.

Stage 0 refers to noninvasive bladder cancer. This means that cancer cells are found in [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lining the inside of the [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) but have not invaded the bladder wall. Stage 0 is divided into stages 0a and 0is, depending on the type of tumor:

- **Stage 0a** is also called noninvasive papillary carcinoma, which may look like long, thin growths extending into the bladder lumen (the space where urine collects). Stage 0a can be [low grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386213&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [high grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386205&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), depending on how [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cells look under the microscope (see the section on [Bladder cancer grade](/types/bladder/stages#_33)).
- **Stage 0is** is also called carcinoma in situ, which is a flat tumor on the tissue lining the inside of the bladder. Stage 0is is always high grade (see the section on [Bladder cancer grade](/types/bladder/stages#_33)).

## Stage I bladder cancer

Stage I is a form of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer that has spread into the [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) but has not reached the muscle layers of the bladder.

## Stage III bladder cancer

Stage III may also be described as [locally advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45955&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) bladder cancer. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.

- In stage IIIA

- cancer has grown all the way through the bladder muscles and bladder wall into the layer of fat surrounding the bladder and may have spread to the reproductive organs ([prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [seminal vesicles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46576&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [uterus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46645&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [vagina](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) but has not spread to [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or
- cancer has spread to one lymph node in the [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46246&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is not near the major [arteries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the pelvis, called the common iliac arteries. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/749310.jpg)![Two-panel drawing showing stage IIIA bladder cancer in a male (left panel) and a female (right panel); both panels show cancer in the bladder and in (a) the layer of fat around the bladder and (b) one lymph node in the pelvis.

Stage IIIA bladder cancer. Cancer (a) has grown all the way through the bladder muscles and bladder wall into the layer of fat around the bladder and may have spread to the prostate and/or seminal vesicles in men or the uterus and/or vagina in women but has not spread to lymph nodes; or (b) has spread to one lymph node in the pelvis that is not near the common iliac arteries.
- In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node in the pelvis that is not near the common iliac arteries or to at least one lymph node that is near the common iliac arteries. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/791435.jpg)![Two-panel drawing showing stage IIIB bladder cancer in a male (left panel) and a female (right panel); both panels show cancer in the bladder and in (a) more than one lymph node in the pelvis that is not near the common iliac artery and (b) one lymph node near the common iliac artery.

## Stage IV bladder cancer

Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB.

- In stage IVA

- cancer has spread to the abdominal wall or [pelvic wall](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=410631&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); or
- cancer has spread to lymph nodes that are above the major arteries in the pelvis, called the common iliac arteries.
- In stage IVB, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung, bone, or liver. [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/749892.jpg)![Stage IVA and IVB bladder cancer; drawing shows cancer that has spread from the bladder to (a) the abdominal or pelvic wall and (b) lymph nodes above the common iliac arteries. Also shown is cancer that has spread to (c) other parts of the body, including the lung, liver, and bone.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/749892-750.jpg "Stage IVA and IVB bladder cancer; drawing shows cancer that has spread from the bladder to (a) the abdominal or pelvic wall and (b) lymph nodes above the common iliac arteries. Also shown is cancer that has spread to (c) other parts of the body, including the lung, liver, and bone.")

Stage IVA and IVB bladder cancer. In stage IVA, cancer has spread to (a) the abdominal or pelvic wall; or (b) lymph nodes above the common iliac arteries. In stage IVB, cancer has spread to (c) other parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, or bone.

Stage IV bladder cancer is also called metastatic bladder cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the [lymphatic system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if bladder cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually bladder cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic bladder cancer, not lung cancer.

## Bladder cancer grade

Cancer grade describes how abnormal the bladder cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread. Your doctor uses grade and other factors about your cancer, such as its stage, to form a treatment plan and in some cases, to estimate your [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- **Low-grade bladder cancer** cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than high-grade cancer cells.
- **High-grade bladder cancer** tends to grow and spread more quickly than low-grade bladder cancer. High-grade cancers usually have a worse prognosis than low-grade cancers and may need treatment right away or treatment that is more aggressive.

To learn more, see [Tumor Grade](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-grade "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-grade").

## Recurrent bladder cancer

Recurrent bladder cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. Bladder cancer tends to recur after treatment, even when it is noninvasive at the time of diagnosis. Low-grade bladder cancer mainly recurs in the bladder lining. High-grade bladder cancer is more likely to have spread to the muscle layers or other parts of the body when it recurs. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned in your body, if it has spread, and how far. The type of treatment that you have for recurrent bladder cancer will depend on where it has come back.
