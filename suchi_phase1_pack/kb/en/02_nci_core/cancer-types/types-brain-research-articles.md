- [Tovorafenib Approved for Some Children with Low-Grade Glioma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/pediatric-low-grade-glioma-tovorafenib-braf)

Posted: May 28, 2024

FDA has granted an accelerated approval to tovorafenib (Ojemda) for kids and teens who have low-grade glioma with changes in the BRAF gene. In a small clinical trial, the drug shrank or completely eliminated tumors in nearly 70% of patients.
- [Genetic Signature May Help Tailor Treatment for Meningioma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/meningioma-gene-expression-signature)

Posted: December 21, 2023

The activity of 34 genes can accurately predict the aggressiveness of meningiomas, a new study shows. This gene expression signature may help oncologists select the best treatments for people with this common type of brain cancer than they can with current methods.
- [Engaging People with Low-Grade Glioma in Cancer Research](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/low-grade-glioma-optimum)

Posted: August 24, 2023

An NCI-supported study called OPTIMUM, part of the Cancer Moonshot, was launched to improve the care of people with brain tumors called low-grade glioma in part by bringing them into glioma-related research.
- [Targeted Drug Combo May Change Care for Rare Brain Tumor Craniopharyngioma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/craniopharyngioma-zelboraf-cotellic)

Posted: August 10, 2023

Treating craniopharyngioma often requires surgery, radiation therapy, or both. But results of a study suggest that, for many, combining the targeted therapies vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and cobimetinib (Cotellic) may substantially delay, or even eliminate, the need for these treatments.
- [Vorasidenib Treatment Shows Promise for Some Low-Grade Gliomas](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/vorasidenib-low-grade-glioma-idh-mutations)

Posted: June 27, 2023

In a large clinical trial, vorasidenib slowed the growth of low-grade gliomas that had mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Vorasidenib is the first targeted drug developed specifically to treat brain tumors.
- [How Some Brain Tumors Hijack the Mind to Grow](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/glioblastoma-hijacks-neuroplasticity-tsp-1)

Posted: June 21, 2023

Researchers have found that the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma can co-opt the formation of new synapses to fuel its own growth. This neural redirection also appears to play a role in the devastating cognitive decline seen in many people with glioblastoma.
- [Vulnerability in Brain Tumors May Open Door to New Treatments](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/glioma-treatment-targeting-pyrimidine-synthesis)

Posted: September 26, 2022

Two companion studies have found different forms of some brain tumors, diffuse midline glioma and IDH-mutant glioma, become dependent for their survival on the production of chemicals called pyrimidines. Clinical trials are planned to test a drug that blocks pyrimidine synthesis in patients with gliomas.
- [For Some Kids with Brain Cancer, Targeted Therapy Is Better than Chemo](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/glioma-brain-cancer-dabrafenib-trametinib)

Posted: June 29, 2022

The combination of dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) shrank more brain tumors, kept the tumors at bay for longer, and caused fewer side effects than chemotherapy, trial results showed. The children all had glioma with a BRAF V600 mutation that could not be surgically removed or came back after surgery.
- [New Way to Classify Meningioma Brain Tumors Suggests Potential Treatments](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/meningioma-brain-tumor-new-classifications)

Posted: June 17, 2022

Two separate but complementary studies have identified a new way to classify meningioma, the most common type of brain tumor. The grouping system may help predict whether a patient’s tumor will grow back after treatment and identify new treatments.
- [Experimental Medulloblastoma Treatment Gets a Boost with Nanoparticles](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/medulloblastoma-nanoparticle-palbociclib-sapanisertib)

Posted: February 25, 2022

A nanoparticle coating may help cancer drugs reach medulloblastoma tumors in the brain and make the treatment less toxic. Mice treated with nanoparticles containing palbociclib (Ibrance) and sapanisertib lived substantially longer than those treated with either drug alone.
- [Test Detects Early Signs of Remaining Cancer in Kids Treated for Medulloblastoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/medulloblastoma-children-test-residual-disease)
