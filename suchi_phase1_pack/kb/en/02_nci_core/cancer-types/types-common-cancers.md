# Common Cancer Types - NCI

# Common Cancer Types

This list of common cancer types includes cancers that are diagnosed with the greatest frequency in the United States, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers:

[Bladder Cancer](/types/bladder)
[Breast Cancer](/types/breast)
[Colon and Rectal Cancer](/types/colorectal)
[Endometrial Cancer](/types/uterine)
[Kidney Cancer](/types/kidney)
[Leukemia](/types/leukemia)
[Liver](/types/liver/what-is-liver-cancer)

[Lung Cancer](/types/lung)
[Melanoma](/types/skin)
[Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](/types/lymphoma)
[Pancreatic Cancer](/types/pancreatic)
[Prostate Cancer](/types/prostate)
[Thyroid Cancer](/types/thyroid)

Cancer incidence and mortality statistics reported by the National Cancer Institute and other resources were used to create the list.[1](#1) To qualify as a common cancer for the list, the estimated annual incidence for 2025 had to be 40,000 cases or more.

The most common type of cancer on the list is breast cancer, with 319,750 new cases expected in the United States in 2025. The next most common cancers are prostate cancer and lung cancer.

Because colon and rectal cancers are often referred to as "colorectal cancers," these two cancer types are combined for the list. For 2025, the estimated number of new cases of colon cancer and rectal cancer are 107,320 and 46,950, respectively, adding to a total of 154,270 new cases of colorectal cancer.

The following table gives the estimated numbers of new cases and deaths for each common cancer type in 2025:

| Cancer Type | Estimated New Cases | Estimated Deaths |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bladder | 84,870 | 17,420 |
| Breast (Female – Male) | 316,950 – 2,800 | 42,170 – 510 |
| Colon and Rectal (Combined) | 154,270 | 52,900 |
| Endometrial | 69,120 | 13,860 |
| Kidney (Renal Cell and Renal Pelvis) | 80,980 | 14,510 |
| Leukemia (All Types) | 66,890 | 23,540 |
| Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct | 42,240 | 30,090 |
| Lung (Including Bronchus) | 226,650 | 124,730 |
| Melanoma | 104,960 | 8,430 |
| Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma | 80,350 | 19,390 |
| Pancreatic | 67,440 | 51,980 |
| Prostate | 313,780 | 35,770 |
| Thyroid | 44,020 | 2,290 |
