# Liver and Bile Duct Cancer - NCI

# Liver and Bile Duct Cancer

Cancer that starts in the liver is called primary liver cancer. The most common type of primary liver cancer in adults is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This type of liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children is different than treatment for adults.

Bile duct cancer, also called cholangiocarcinoma, is cancer that starts in the bile ducts, which are tubes that connect the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. Cancer that forms in the bile ducts inside the liver is called intrahepatic bile duct cancer. If it forms in the bile ducts outside of the liver it is called extrahepatic bile duct cancer.

Explore the links on this page to learn more about the different types of liver and bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), including causes and risk factors, how the cancer is found, and how it is treated.
