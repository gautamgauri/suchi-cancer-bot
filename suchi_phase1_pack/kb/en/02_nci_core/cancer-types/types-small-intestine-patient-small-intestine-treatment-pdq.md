### Small intestine cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the small intestine.

The [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is part of the
body’s [digestive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which also includes the
[esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [large
intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The
digestive system removes and processes [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[carbohydrates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fats, [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and water) from foods and helps pass waste
material out of the body. The small intestine is a long tube that connects the stomach to the large intestine. It folds many times to fit inside the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/751388.jpg)![Drawing of the small intestine showing the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Also shown are the stomach, appendix, large intestine, and rectum.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/751388-750.jpg "Drawing of the small intestine showing the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Also shown are the stomach, appendix, large intestine, and rectum.")

The small intestine is a long tube-like organ that connects the stomach to the large intestine. The small intestine includes the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

### There are five types of small intestine cancer.

The types of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found in the small intestine are [adenocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45562&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [neuroendocrine tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44904&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [gastrointestinal stromal tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44998&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This summary discusses adenocarcinoma and [leiomyosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46027&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a type of sarcoma).

Adenocarcinoma starts in [glandular](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the lining of the small intestine and is the most common type of [small intestine cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Most of these [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occur in the part of the small intestine near the stomach. They may grow and block the intestine.

Leiomyosarcoma starts in the smooth muscle cells of the small intestine. Most of these tumors occur in the part of the small intestine near the large intestine.

For more information on small intestine cancer, see the following:

- [Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment](/types/gi-neuroendocrine-tumors/patient/gi-neuroendocrine-treatment-pdq)
- [Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment](/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/patient/gist-treatment-pdq)

### Diet and health history can affect the risk of developing small intestine cancer.

Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called
a [risk factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Not every person with one or more of these risk factors will develop small intestine cancer, and it will develop in some people who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for small intestine cancer include the following:

- Eating a high-fat [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having [Crohn disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45661&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having [celiac disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=377726&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having [familial adenomatous polyposis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FAP).

### Signs and symptoms of small intestine cancer include unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain.

These and other [signs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be caused by small intestine cancer or by other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:

- Pain or cramps in the middle of the abdomen.
- Weight loss with no known reason.
- A lump in the abdomen.
- [Blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [stool](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46605&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Tests that examine the small intestine are used to diagnose and stage small intestine cancer.

Procedures
that make pictures of the small intestine and the area around it help [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) small intestine cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used
to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the small intestine is
called [staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the type of small intestine cancer and whether the tumor can be removed by
[surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Tests and procedures
to detect, diagnose, and [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) small intestine cancer are usually done at the same
time. In addition to asking about your [personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642019&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [family health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642015&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and doing a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:

- **[Blood chemistry studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by [organs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.
- **[Liver function tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390293&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by small intestine cancer.
- **[Endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) areas. There are different types of endoscopy:

- **[Upper endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=470253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and [duodenum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46443&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (first part of the small intestine, near the stomach). An [endoscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46428&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a [lens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for signs of cancer.
- **[Capsule endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=749900&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A capsule that is about the size of a large pill and contains a light and a tiny wireless camera is swallowed by the patient. The capsule travels through the [digestive tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46447&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including the small intestine, and sends many pictures of the inside of the digestive tract to a recorder that is worn around the waist or over the shoulder. The pictures are sent from the recorder to a computer and viewed by the doctor who checks for signs of cancer. The capsule passes out of the body during a [bowel movement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651179&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Double balloon endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=749903&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A special instrument made up of two tubes (one inside the other) is inserted through the mouth or [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and into the small intestine. The inside tube (an endoscope with a light and lens for viewing) is moved through part of the small intestine and a balloon at the end of it is inflated to keep the endoscope in place. Next, the outer tube is moved through the small intestine to reach the end of the endoscope, and a balloon at the end of the outer tube is inflated to keep it in place. Then, the balloon at the end of the endoscope is deflated and the endoscope is moved through the next part of the small intestine. These steps are repeated many times as the tubes move through the small intestine. The doctor is able to see the inside of the small intestine through the endoscope and use a tool to remove samples of abnormal tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure may be done if the results of a capsule endoscopy are abnormal. This procedure is also called double balloon enteroscopy.
- **[Laparotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45747&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A [surgical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) procedure in which an [incision](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs or [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.
- **[Biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. This may be done during an endoscopy or laparotomy. The sample is checked by a [pathologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46244&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to see if it contains cancer cells.
- **[Upper GI series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46637&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with small [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) follow-through**: A series of [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. The patient drinks a liquid that contains [barium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=739782&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a silver-white [metallic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The liquid coats the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. X-rays are taken at different times as the barium travels through the upper [GI tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and small bowel.
- **[CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAT scan)**: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A [dye](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=409764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
- **[MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (magnetic resonance imaging)**: A procedure that uses a magnet, [radio waves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651209&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).

### Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.

The [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment options depend on the following:

- The type of small intestine cancer.
- Whether the cancer is in the inner lining of the small intestine only or has spread into or beyond the wall of the small intestine.
- Whether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or [peritoneum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45829&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (tissue that lines the wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen).
- Whether the cancer can be completely removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Stages of Small Intestine Cancer

### Key Points

- Tests and procedures to stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- Small intestine cancer is grouped according to whether or not the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.
- Small intestine cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

### Tests and procedures to stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.

[Staging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is used to find out how far the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has spread, but treatment decisions are not based on [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). See the [General Information](/types/small-intestine/patient/small-intestine-treatment-pdq#_19) section for a description of tests and procedures used to detect, [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and stage [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer.

### There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.

Cancer can spread through [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [lymph system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
- Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the [lymph vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269462&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.
- Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other parts of the body.

### Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer cells break away from where they began (the [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and travel through the lymph system or blood.

- Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor) in another part of the body.
- Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if small intestine cancer spreads to the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the cancer cells in the liver are actually small intestine cancer cells. The disease is metastatic small intestine cancer, not [liver cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44242&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.

### Small intestine cancer is grouped according to whether or not the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.

Treatment depends on whether the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and if the cancer is being treated as a [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or is [metastatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Small intestine cancer can recur (come back) after it has been treated.

The cancer may come back in the small intestine or in other parts of the body.

## Treatment Option Overview

### Key Points

- There are different types of treatment for patients with small intestine cancer.
- The following types of treatment are used:
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Immunotherapy
- Radiation therapy with radiosensitizers
- Treatment for small intestine cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### There are different types of treatment for patients with small intestine cancer.

Different types of treatments are available for patients with [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some treatments are [standard](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A treatment clinical trial is a [research study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

### The following types of treatment are used:

#### Surgery

[Surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the most common treatment of small intestine cancer.
One of the following types of surgery may be done:

- [Resection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46565&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to remove part or all of an [organ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that contains cancer. The resection may include the small intestine and nearby organs (if the cancer has spread). The doctor may remove the section of the small intestine that contains cancer and perform an [anastomosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46534&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (joining the cut ends of the intestine
together). The doctor will usually remove [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near the small intestine and examine them under
a [microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638184&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to see whether they contain cancer.
- [Bypass](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46498&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Surgery to allow food in the small intestine to go around (bypass) a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is blocking the intestine but cannot be removed.

After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after surgery to kill any cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. [External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.

External radiation therapy is used to treat small intestine cancer.

#### Chemotherapy

[Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a cancer treatment that uses [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body ([systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

### New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

#### Immunotherapy

[Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a treatment that uses the patient's [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer.

#### Radiation therapy with radiosensitizers

[Radiosensitizers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46553&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.

### Treatment for small intestine cancer may cause side effects.

For information about [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by treatment for cancer, visit our [Side Effects](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects") page.

### Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

For some patients, taking part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

### Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer treatment.

Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s [clinical trials search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/") website.

### Follow-up tests may be needed.

As you go through treatment, you will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.

Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of small intestine cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
