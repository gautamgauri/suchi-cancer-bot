## Overview

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) causes two-thirds of the cases of vaginal cancer. Vaccines that protect against infection with HPV may reduce the risk of vaginal cancer. When found early, vaginal cancer can often be cured. Explore the links on this page to learn more about vaginal cancer treatment, research, and clinical trials.
