- [Toripalimab Becomes First Immunotherapy Drug Approved for Nasopharyngeal Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-toripalimab-nasopharyngeal-cancer)

Posted: January 3, 2024

FDA approved toripalimab (Loqtorzi) based on the results of a large clinical trial showing that, when added to chemotherapy, the drug extended survival in people with nasopharyngeal cancer that returned after initial treatment or spread in the body.
- [Study in India Could Make Immunotherapy More Affordable Worldwide](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/cancer-immunotherapy-low-dose)

Posted: November 22, 2022

A study in India has found that an ultra-low dose of the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (Opdivo) helped people with advanced head and neck cancer live longer. Because the dose is 6% of what’s typically used in the United States and Europe, it is potentially more affordable.
- [Treatments for Oropharyngeal Cancer Are Very Effective, But Are There Ways to Do Less Harm?](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/hpv-oropharyngeal-cancer-less-treatment-fewer-side-effects)

Posted: May 20, 2021

Can some people with HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, a type of head and neck cancer, get less intense treatment without risking their cancer coming back? Researchers are trying to find out.
- [HPV Vaccine May Provide Men with “Herd Immunity” against Oral HPV Infections](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/men-oral-hpv-infection-vaccine-herd-immunity)

Posted: October 8, 2019

Oral HPV infections cause over 70% of all oropharyngeal cancers in the United States. In a new study of adults aged 18‒59, the rate of HPV vaccination rose from 0% to 6% for men, while oral HPV infections fell by 37% among unvaccinated men.
- [Cetuximab with radiation found to be inferior to standard treatment in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer](/news-events/press-releases/2018/oropharyngeal-hpv-cisplatin)

Posted: August 14, 2018

Results from a randomized clinical trial show patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation and cetuximab had inferior survival compared to the current standard treatment with radiation and cisplatin. The trial’s goal was to find a less toxic treatment approach without compromising survival.
- [HPV Vaccination Linked to Decreased Oral HPV Infections](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/hpv-vaccine-oral-infection)

Posted: June 5, 2017

A study of more than 2,600 young adults found that the prevalence of oral infection with four HPV types, including two cancer-causing types, was 88% lower in those who reported receiving at least one dose of an HPV vaccine than in those not vaccinated.
- [Nivolumab Improves Survival for Patients with Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer](/types/head-and-neck/research/nivolumab-hnscc)

Posted: January 4, 2017

Results from a phase III trial showed that nivolumab (Opdivo®) improved overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
- [FDA Approves Nivolumab for Head and Neck Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/fda-nivolumab-scchn)

Posted: December 1, 2016

The FDA has approved nivolumab for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that has progressed during chemotherapy with a platinum-based drug or that has recurred or metastasized after platinum-based chemotherapy.
- [FDA Approves Pembrolizumab for Head and Neck Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/fda-pembrolizumab-hnscc)

Posted: August 24, 2016

FDA granted pembrolizumab an accelerated approval for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer that has continued to progress despite standard treatment with chemotherapy.
- [PET-CT–Guided Surveillance May Reduce Need for Surgery in Some Patients with Advanced Head and Neck Cancer](/types/head-and-neck/research/pet-ct-surveillance)

Posted: May 20, 2016

Patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who underwent PET-CT–guided surveillance after chemoradiation had overall survival rates similar to those of patients who underwent planned neck dissection and chemoradiation. But PET-CT imaging resulted in fewer operations and was more cost-effective than neck dissection.
- [Prospective Study Links HPV Detection in the Mouth to Head and Neck Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/hpv-head-and-neck-cancer)

Posted: February 12, 2016

A new study confirms that infection with HPV 16 precedes the development of head and neck cancer.
- [Genome Study Yields Clues to Head and Neck Cancers](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/tcga-head-and-neck-hpv)

Posted: February 3, 2015

Researchers have surveyed the genetic changes in nearly 300 head and neck cancers, revealing some previously unknown alterations that may play a role in the disease, including in patients whose cancer is associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV).
- [NIH-funded study uncovers range of molecular alterations in head and neck cancers, new potential drug targets; TCGA tumor genome sequencing analyses offer new insights into the effects of HPV and smoking](/news-events/press-releases/2015/tcgaheadneck)

Posted: January 28, 2015

Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have discovered genomic differences – with potentially important clinical implications – in head and neck cancers caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV).
