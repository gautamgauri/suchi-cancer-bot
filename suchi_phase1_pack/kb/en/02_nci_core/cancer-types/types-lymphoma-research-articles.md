See [Advances in Lymphoma Research](/types/lymphoma/research) for an overview of recent findings and progress, plus ongoing projects supported by NCI.

- [Nivolumab Appears to Boost Cure Rate in Advanced Hodgkin Lymphoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/hodgkin-lymphoma-nivolumab-avd-first-line)

Posted: November 14, 2024

In a nearly 1,000-patient trial, treatment with nivolumab (Opdivo) and the chemotherapy regimen AVD was better at eliminating cancer and keeping it at bay than the current standard initial treatment for the disease, AVD and brentuximab (Adcetris). The nivolumab combination also had fewer side effects.

An NCI study shows that people with low-grade lymphomatoid granulomatosis who are treated with interferon alfa-2b, a type of immunotherapy, can live for decades after diagnosis.

Results from three clinical trials have found that CAR T cells may be superior to standard treatments for patients with B-cell NHL that has not responded to treatment (refractory) or has returned after treatment (relapsed).
- [Ibrutinib improves survival for younger people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma](/news-events/press-releases/2021/ibrutinib-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma)

Posted: November 4, 2021

NCI researchers have found that adding the targeted therapy ibrutinib (Imbruvica) to standard chemotherapy can improve how long some younger people with a specific form of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma live. The new findings come from a new analysis of a previously conducted phase 3 clinical trial called Phoenix.
- [COVID-19 Vaccines May Be Less Effective in Some People with Cancer](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/covid-vaccine-limited-protection-in-cancer-patients)

Posted: May 27, 2021

People with blood cancers seem to be less protected by COVID-19 vaccines than those with other cancers and people without cancer, three new studies suggest. Experts believe this limited effectiveness is likely due to patients’ weakened immune systems.
- [Brentuximab May Mean Less Radiation for Children, Teens with Hodgkin Lymphoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2021/brentuximab-hodgkin-lymphoma-less-radiation-children-teens)

Posted: May 7, 2021

In a recent study, a treatment regimen using brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) instead of the chemotherapy drug vincristine allowed some children and teens with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma to avoid radiation therapy—and the long-term health problems that can come with it.
- [CAR T-Cell Therapy Approved by FDA for Mantle Cell Lymphoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/fda-brexucabtagene-mantle-cell-lymphoma)

Posted: August 24, 2020

A CAR T-cell therapy called brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for some patients with mantle cell lymphoma. This is the third CAR T-cell therapy approved by FDA for patients with cancer.
- [New Drug Regimen Cures More Children with Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma](/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/rituximab-childhood-b-cell-lymphoma-more-cures)

Posted: July 1, 2020

For children with aggressive Burkitt lymphoma and other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, adding rituximab (Rituxan, Truxima) to chemotherapy substantially increases the likelihood of the child being cured, results from a large clinical trial show.
