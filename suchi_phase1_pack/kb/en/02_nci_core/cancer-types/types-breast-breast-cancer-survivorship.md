Some survivors say they would not have been able to cope without the help and love of their family members.

You may have just learned that you have breast cancer. Or you may be in treatment, finishing treatment, or have a friend or family member with cancer. Wherever you are in dealing with cancer, from the time of diagnosis through the rest of your life, you are thought of as a survivor. As a result, what being a breast cancer survivor means to you may change over time. Or you may not feel that the term applies to you, and that is okay, too.

Having cancer changes your life and the lives of those around you. The symptoms and side effects of the disease and its treatment may cause certain physical changes, but they can also affect the way you feel and how you live.

Learn more about the unique challenges cancer survivors face and find resources to help you cope at [Cancer Survivorship](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship).

## Coping with breast cancer treatment

Cancer treatment can cause side effects or changes to your body and how you feel. You may have different side effects even when you are given the same treatment for the same type of cancer as other people. It’s normal to feel uncertain or fearful about side effects that you may have. Keep in mind your health care team can help prevent and relieve any side effects.

### Side effects of cancer treatment

Breast cancer treatments can cause many physical side effects that affect healthy tissues or organs. The type of side effects you may have depends on the type of treatments you have and their doses. Some side effects that many people with breast cancer have include [lymphedema](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45359) and fertility issues.

Learn more about the possible side effects of cancer treatment at [Side Effects of Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects).

### Emotional effects of cancer treatment

Breast cancer and its treatment can be overwhelming and cause many emotional effects. Just as cancer affects your physical health, it can bring up a wide range of emotions you’re not used to dealing with. It can also make existing feelings seem more intense.

Learn more about how to understand and cope with new, and sometimes difficult, thoughts and feelings at [Emotions and Cancer](/about-cancer/coping/feelings).

### Changes in body image and sexuality

Breast surgery, deciding whether to have breast reconstruction, and hair loss are some examples of how cancer treatment may affect how you look and feel about yourself. Other treatments for breast cancer also may affect your body, how others see you, and how you see yourself. Coping with these changes to your body can be hard, but there are resources that can help you.

Learn more about coping with changes to your body in [How Cancer Affects Your Self-Image and Sexuality](/about-cancer/coping/self-image).

## Follow-up care

Many breast cancer survivors need to visit their doctor regularly to get follow-up exams or tests. Planning and scheduling these appointments can be stressful and time-consuming, but making regular visits with your health care team can help you feel supported.

### Getting Financial Support

Even if you have health insurance, you may face financial challenges and need help dealing with the costs of breast cancer treatment. For tips and ways to cope, visit [Managing Cancer Costs and Medical Information](/about-cancer/managing-care/track-care-costs).

Your doctor may give you a survivorship care plan that details the types of cancer treatment you received and a plan for your follow-up care. At follow-up appointments, your doctor may do imaging and other tests to check for a recurrence, such as:

- [physical exam](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/270871)
- [clinical breast exam](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/304715)
- [mammogram](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45775)
- breast [MRI](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/45788)
- [neurological exam](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/322871)
- [pelvic exam](/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/322873)

Learn more about the health care you should be receiving after treatment at [Follow-Up Medical Care](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/follow-up-care).

## Coping with fear of breast cancer recurrence

You may feel a mix of relief and worry when treatment ends. When you stop having a treatment that was working, it can cause fear that cancer could come back. Tests and scans that are part of normal follow-up care can create anxiety called “scanxiety.” Physical changes in your body also can cause worry. You may fear that any pain or discomfort may be due to cancer’s return. Although these feelings are uncomfortable, they can improve with time and help.

Learn more about how to cope with fear of recurrence at [Life After Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal).

## Late effects of cancer treatment

Late effects are problems caused by cancer treatment that may not show up for months or years after treatment. These problems are specific to certain types of treatments and the amount received. Like side effects that you may have during treatment, late effects can be very different from person to person.

Learn about late effects of treatment and how to cope at [Late Effects of Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/late-effects).

## Getting support

No matter where you are in your cancer journey, you or your caregivers may need help coping. Know that you are not alone. Seek support from family and friends, your health care team, and support groups.

Get advice on how to ask for help in [Adjusting to Cancer](/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer), or learn more about [Cancer Support Groups](/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer/support-groups).

## Support for caregivers

If you are caring for someone who has cancer, it’s important to know what resources are available to you. Learn more in [Support for Caregivers of Cancer Patients](/about-cancer/coping/caregiver-support).
