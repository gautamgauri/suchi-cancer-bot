# Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress - NCI

# Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## Overview

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal/ptsd-hp-pdq)

### Key Points

- People react in different ways when they hear they have cancer.
- PTS can occur at any point during the cancer journey.

### People react in different ways when they hear they have cancer.

People have a range of normal
reactions when they hear they have [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These include:

- Repeated frightening thoughts.
- Being distracted or overexcited.
- Trouble sleeping.
- Feeling detached from oneself or reality.

These reactions may also be [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cancer-related post-traumatic
stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=770485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PTS). Talk with your health care team if you continue to have these symptoms.

### PTS can occur at any point during the cancer journey.

People with cancer may have symptoms of post-traumatic stress at any point from [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) through treatment, after treatment is complete, or during [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Adult survivors of [childhood cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=728326&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and their families may also have post-traumatic stress.

Cancer-related PTS may or may not lead to [post-traumatic stress disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440112&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PTSD). PTSD is a specific group of [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that affect [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [stressful](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) events. These events usually involve the threat of death or serious
injury to oneself or others. Cancer and its treatment may cause distress, but it does not mean it will develop into PTSD. Your health care team will evaluate your symptoms during your cancer journey.

## Factors That Affect the Risk of Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS)

### Key Points

- Certain factors may increase the risk of PTS in people with cancer.
- Physical factors
- Psychological, mental, and social factors
- Certain protective factors may reduce the risk of PTS in people with cancer.
- PTS symptoms develop by conditioning.

### Certain factors may increase the risk of PTS in people with cancer.

Not everyone is at increased risk of [cancer-related post-traumatic stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=770485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Certain physical and mental factors that are linked to PTS or [PTSD](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been reported in studies:

#### Physical factors

- [Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that [recurs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (comes back) increased [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- In survivors of [childhood cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=728326&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), symptoms of PTS occurred more often when there was a longer treatment time.
- [Breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who had [advanced cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), long [surgeries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [trauma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [anxiety disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797031&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), were more likely to be [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with PTSD.

#### Psychological, mental, and social factors

- Previous trauma.
- High level of general stress.
- [Genetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46391&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) factors and [biological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44510&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) factors (such as a [hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) that affect memory and learning.
- Lack of [social support](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Threat to life and body.
- Having PTSD or other [psychological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems before being diagnosed with cancer.
- The use of [avoidance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454798&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with stress.

### Certain protective factors may reduce the risk of PTS in people with cancer.

People with cancer may have a lower risk of PTS if they have:

- Good social support.
- Clear information about the [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of their cancer.
- An open relationship with their [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### PTS symptoms develop by conditioning.

[Conditioning](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454799&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occurs when certain [triggers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454808&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) become linked with an upsetting event. Neutral triggers (such as smells, sounds, and sights) that occurred at the same time as upsetting triggers (such as [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or painful treatments) later cause [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), stress, and fear even when they occur alone, after the trauma has ended.

In people
who have a history of PTSD from a previous [trauma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may start again by
certain triggers during their cancer treatment (for example,
being inside [MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45788&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [CT](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) scanners). They also may have problems adjusting to cancer and cancer treatment.

## Screening for Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS)

### Key Points

- The cancer experience is more than one stressful event.
- The specific cause of cancer-related PTS may be unknown.
- Symptoms of cancer-related PTS are a lot like symptoms of other stress-related disorders.

### The cancer experience is more than one stressful event.

[Cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may involve [stressful](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) events that repeat or continue over time. This may cause [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of post-traumatic stress anytime from
[diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) through treatment and possible cancer [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), so [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be needed more than once. The health care team will look for symptoms of PTS or [PTSD](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### The specific cause of cancer-related PTS may be unknown.

For a person coping with cancer, the specific trauma that triggers [cancer-related post-traumatic stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=770485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) isn't always known. Because the cancer
experience involves so many upsetting events, it is much harder to know the exact cause of [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) than it is for other traumas, such as
natural disasters or physical assault.

### Symptoms of cancer-related PTS are a lot like symptoms of other stress-related disorders.

PTS has many of the same [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [anxiety disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797031&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [phobias](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454806&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Some of the symptoms that may be seen in PTS and in other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include:

- Feeling defensive, irritable, or fearful.
- Being unable to think clearly.
- Sleeping problems.
- Avoiding people.
- Avoiding stressful memories.
- Guilt and self-blame.
- Loss of interest in life.

## Treatment of Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS)

### Key Points

- Treatments used for PTS may be the same as treatments for PTSD.
- Talking with a counselor, relaxation techniques, and support groups may help reduce symptoms of PTS.
- Medicines may help severe symptoms of PTS.

### Treatments used for PTS may be the same as treatments for PTSD.

Although there are no specific treatments for cancer-related PTS, treatments used for [PTSD](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be useful in relieving [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in people with cancer and [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Talking with a counselor, relaxation techniques, and support groups may help reduce symptoms of PTS.

A [crisis intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450099&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used in people with cancer to help them relieve distress and return to normal activities. This method focuses on solving
problems, teaching [coping skills](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and providing a supportive setting.

Some people are helped by methods that teach them to change their behaviors by changing their thinking patterns. Through [cognitive behavioral therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CBT), they may:

- Understand their [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Learn ways to [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and to manage [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (such as [relaxation techniques](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- Become aware of thinking patterns that cause distress and negative emotions and replace them with more balanced and useful ways of thinking.
- Become less sensitive to upsetting [triggers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454808&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Support groups](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45917&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may also help people who have PTS
symptoms. In the group setting, they can get emotional support, learn coping skills, and meet
others with similar experiences and symptoms.

### Medicines may help severe symptoms of PTS.

For people with severe [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of PTS, medicines may be used. For example:

- Tricyclic and [monoamine oxidase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561433&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (MOA) [antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used when PTS occurs along with
[depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335507&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (SSRIs) may reduce the stress that occurs in what is known as the "[fight-or-flight syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=770487&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)".
- Antianxiety
medicines may help reduce symptoms of [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In certain cases, [antipsychotic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) medicines may reduce severe flashbacks.

## Post-Traumatic Stress in Children With Cancer and Cancer Survivors

### Key Points

- Children and teens with cancer may be at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
- Cancer survivors with PTS need early treatment with methods that are used to treat other trauma victims.
- Cancer survivors and their families need long-term monitoring for PTS.

### Children and teens with cancer may be at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In children and teens with cancer, [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of PTS or [PTSD](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440111&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may occur during treatment or after treatment has ended. Those who feel very uncertain about their disease and future may be more likely to have PTSD symptoms.

Childhood cancer survivors who are diagnosed with PTSD are more likely to have [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), lower satisfaction with life, and lack of daily life skills.

### Cancer survivors with PTS need early treatment with methods that are used to treat other trauma victims.

Effects of PTS are long-lasting and serious. It may affect the ability to have a normal lifestyle and may affect personal relationships, education, and employment. People with cancer may avoid getting professional care to avoid places and persons linked with cancer.

It is important that cancer survivors are aware of the possible mental [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of living with cancer and the need for early treatment of PTS. Follow-up cancer care may be given by the cancer treatment doctor or the main provider, such as the family doctor. Many survivors get help from therapists who are experts in helping people who are recovering from cancer. More than one kind of treatment may be used.

### Cancer survivors and their families need long-term monitoring for PTS.

[Symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of PTS usually begin within the first 3 months after the [trauma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but sometimes they do not appear for months or even years. Therefore, cancer survivors and their families need long-term monitoring. Learn more about [Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-pdq).

## Current Clinical Trials

Use our [clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of cancer-related post-traumatic stress. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
