# Coping - Adjusting to Cancer - NCI

# Adjusting to Cancer

When you first learn you have cancer, everything seems to change in an instant. You may feel like your life has been turned upside down. Once the shock wears off, the process of making changes begins. You may have to adjust your tasks and routines as treatment starts. You also may need to deal with symptoms and [side effects](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects) that can affect both your body and your emotions.

It can seem overwhelming at first, but knowing what to expect may help you feel more at ease.
