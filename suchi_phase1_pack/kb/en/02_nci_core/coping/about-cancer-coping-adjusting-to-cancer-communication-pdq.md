# Communication in Cancer Care - NCI

# Communication in Cancer Care (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## Overview

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer/communication-hp-pdq)

### Key Points

- Good communication between people with cancer, their family, and the health care team is important in cancer care.
- Families may experience communication challenges.

### Good communication between people with cancer, their family, and the health care team is important in cancer care.

Good communication with your family and the health care team has a positive effect on your [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) journey.

The goals of good communication in cancer care are to:

- Build a trusting relationship with your health care team.
- Learn from your health care team about your cancer [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Discuss your options for treatment and care throughout your cancer journey.
- Improve your well-being and [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

You will face many decisions when you are diagnosed with cancer. Tell your health care team about concerns you have during treatment, and if you have problems [coping](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with the cancer diagnosis.

Studies show that there are many positive results when people with cancer and their doctors communicate well during cancer care. Positive results include:

- More likely to be content with care.
- More likely to follow through with treatment.
- Better quality of life.
- Reduced [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- More likely to take part in a [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Improved knowledge of the [disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=811791&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Preferred care is received at end of life.

Ask for help from a [patient navigator](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791361&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). A patient navigator can guide you through the health care system and help you communicate with your health care team, so you get the information you need to make decisions about your care.

### Families may experience communication challenges.

You will go through different emotions when you have cancer. You may want to hide feelings of [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and sadness and act normal to protect your family and friends. This is also often true for friends and family. Talking about cancer-related issues may help reduce [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for you and your family. Family-focused [psychotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may also benefit you and your family.

## Factors in Communication

### Key Points

- Tell your health care team how you want to receive information about your cancer and treatment.
- There are ways to improve communication with your doctors.
- Culture can also affect communication.

### Tell your health care team how you want to receive information about your cancer and treatment.

You may want written instructions and phone calls, or you may prefer texts and emails. Let your health care team know how you want to receive your information about your cancer and cancer treatment.

### There are ways to improve communication with your doctors.

It may be hard to remember what your doctor said and what you want to ask at each appointment. Make a list of the questions you want to ask before your visit. The following suggestions may help you remember what was said:

- Have a family member go with you when you meet with your doctor.
- Ask for a copy of the information so you can read it after your visit.
- Record the discussion.

Ask if your doctor or clinic offers any of the following:

- A packet that includes items such as a question idea sheet, booklets on decision-making and patient rights, and information about the clinic.
- A psychologist you can talk to about how you are feeling.

### Culture can also affect communication.

Some [cultures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476357&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) place a greater emphasis on communication with the family as a whole unit, while other cultures focus more on the patient's ability to make their own decisions. Tell your health care team how much information you want to receive.

Your [religious](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=489395&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) beliefs may be a source of strength and [coping](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for you. Tell your health care team about any [spiritual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and religious needs and concerns you want them to know about. For more information, see [Spirituality in Cancer Care](/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-pdq).

## Communication in Pediatric Cancer Care

### Key Points

- Many parents want to know their child's prognosis.
- Children with cancer want to know about their illness and how it will be treated.
- Children may wish to know what is going on when someone they love has cancer.

### Many parents want to know their child's prognosis.

When your child has [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), you will likely have questions about how serious the cancer is and your child's chances of survival. The likely [outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or course of a [disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=811791&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is called [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Ask your child's cancer care team about your child's prognosis. Knowing this information can help you and your loved ones make decisions. No two people are alike, and responses to treatment can vary greatly. Your child's cancer care team is in the best position to talk with you about your child's prognosis.

### Children with cancer want to know about their illness and how it will be treated.

The amount of information a child may want to know depends in part on their age. Most children worry about how their illness and treatment will affect their daily lives and the people around them. Studies also show that children have less doubt and fear when they are given information they can understand about their illness, even if it is bad news.

### Children may wish to know what is going on when someone they love has cancer.

When a parent has cancer, the child may have high levels of [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Children may also experience [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and distress when they see a [sibling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=616710&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) going through cancer [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or dying. Children do better when family members or the health care team talk with them about what to expect and answer their questions. For ways to help teens [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and communicate when a loved one has cancer, see [Support for Teens When a Family Member Has Cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/caregiver-support/teens "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/caregiver-support/teens").

## Electronic Communication in Cancer Care

### Key Points

- Your health care team may reach out to you using electronic methods.

### Your health care team may reach out to you using electronic methods.

A method to get health information that is used frequently in [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is [eHealth](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=812871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). eHealth refers to the use of digital technology, such as home computers, smart phones, and the Internet to find and send health information. eHealth helps:

- Send information between patients, family members, and the health care team.
- Improve [shared decision making](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799190&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Improve how patients explain their concerns to the health care team.
- Give [social support](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to patients.
- Provide [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information.

## Communication at End of Life

### Key Points

- Early communication about end-of-life decisions is important.
- Early conversations with your doctors can help you feel prepared for end-of-life decisions.
- Talk with your doctor about your prognosis and treatment options.

### Early communication about end-of-life decisions is important.

When you learn you have terminal cancer, you're faced with decisions that will affect your end-of-life care. Talk about these decisions early to make it easier on you and your family later. The following are some questions to consider:

- What's important to me at the end of life?
- Is it most important that I be as comfortable and alert as possible during the last stages of cancer?
- Is it most important to continue with treatments that may help me live longer but are painful?

When you and your family decide it is time to move from active treatment to end-of-life care, your goals and desires are important. It may be difficult to start the discussion about end-of-life care with your doctor, but it is important to make these decisions early in your cancer journey.

### Early conversations with your doctors can help you feel prepared for end-of-life decisions.

Many people with terminal cancer who start talking with their doctors early about end-of-life issues report feeling better prepared. Early communication with your doctors may make it easier to deal with concerns about being older, living alone, symptom control, spiritual well-being, and how your family will cope in the future.

Ask your doctor or clinic about an end-of-life consultation, which includes a list of questions that can help you explain your wishes for the end of life.

### Talk with your doctor about your prognosis and treatment options.

It is important to understand your prognosis when you make decisions about your care and treatment if you have terminal cancer. You may want to know how long you have to live. It can be different for each person and depends on the type of cancer, where it has spread, and whether you have other illnesses. Some people want more information on their prognosis than others.

Your doctor can talk about treatment options with you and your family and explain the effects they may have on your cancer and your quality of life. Make sure you understand your options and ask questions if you need more information. People who discuss end-of-life choices with their doctors are more likely to receive the care they want.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about communicating with the cancer patient and his or her family. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
