# Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress - NCI

# Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## Overview

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq)

### Key Points

- People with cancer have different levels of distress.
- There are certain risk factors for high levels of distress in people with cancer.
- Your doctor will screen you to find out if you need help adjusting to cancer.

### People with cancer have different levels of distress.

Some people with cancer have a low level of distress, and others have higher levels of distress. The level of distress ranges from being able to adjust to living with cancer to having a serious [mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disorder, such as major depression.

This summary describes the milder levels of distress in adults with cancer, including:

- Normal adjustment: A condition in which a person makes changes in his or her life to manage a stressful event such as a cancer diagnosis. In normal adjustment, a person learns to cope well with emotional distress and solve problems related to cancer.
- [Psychological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and social distress: A [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which a person has some trouble making changes in their life to manage a stressful event such as a cancer diagnosis. The feelings of distress may range from normal feelings of vulnerability and sadness to feelings that affect quality of life, such as depression, panic, and spiritual crisis. Help from a professional to learn new [coping skills](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be needed.
- [Adjustment disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A condition in which a person has a lot of trouble making changes in his or her life to manage a stressful event such as a cancer diagnosis. Symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or other emotional, social, or behavioral problems occur and worsen the person's quality of life. [Medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and counseling to manage these [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be needed.
- [Anxiety disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797031&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A condition in which a person has severe anxiety. It may be caused by a stressful event like a cancer diagnosis, or the cause may be unknown. Symptoms of anxiety disorder include extreme worry, fear, and dread. When the symptoms are severe, it affects a person's ability to lead a normal life. There are many types of anxiety disorders, including:

- [Generalized anxiety disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476551&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Panic disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a condition that causes sudden feelings of panic).
- [Agoraphobia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (fear of open places or situations in which it might be hard to get help if needed).
- Social anxiety disorder (fear of social situations).
- [Phobia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454806&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (fear of a specific object or situation).
- [Obsessive-compulsive disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454805&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Post-traumatic stress disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440112&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### There are certain risk factors for high levels of distress in people with cancer.

Nearly half of people with cancer report having a lot of distress. In general, the type of cancer does not make a difference in the amount of distress reported. Factors that increase the risk of anxiety and distress are not always related to the cancer.

[Risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for high levels of distress in people with cancer include:

- Trouble doing the usual [activities of daily living](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Physical problems and side effects of treatment (such as [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), nausea, or pain).
- Problems at home.
- Unmet social and spiritual needs.
- Depression, [cancer-related post-traumatic stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=770485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or other emotional problems.
- Being diagnosed with [advanced-stage cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Having experienced childhood abuse.
- Being younger, female, or non-White.
- Having a lower level of education.

People who have a high level of distress when they are diagnosed with cancer are more likely to have continued high levels of distress after their diagnosis.

### Your doctor will screen you to find out if you need help adjusting to cancer.

Screening is usually done by asking about how you feel, your energy level, relationships, work, and finances. Your doctor may refer you to a [social worker](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44730&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), mental health
professional, [palliative care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269448&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [specialist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [pastoral counselor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454705&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for further evaluation and [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Normal Adjustment

### Key Points

- Each person will cope in different ways.
- People who are adjusting to the changes caused by cancer may have distress.
- People with cancer need different coping skills at different points in time.
- Hearing the diagnosis
- Being treated for cancer
- Remission after treatment
- Learning that the cancer has come back
- Stopping cancer treatment
- Becoming a long-term cancer survivor

### Each person will cope in different ways.

The way people with cancer [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is usually linked to their personality traits (such as whether they usually expect the best versus the worst, or if they are shy versus outgoing).

You may find it easier to adjust if you carry on with your usual routine and work, and keep doing activities that matter to you. People who adjust well to coping with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) continue to find meaning and importance in their lives. People who do not adjust well may withdraw from relationships or situations and feel hopeless.

If you are having trouble coping with cancer you may find it helpful to talk with a professional about your concerns and worries. These [specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include:

- [Mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) professionals, including [psychologists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44716&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [psychiatrists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454706&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Social workers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44730&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Palliative care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269448&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) specialists.
- Religious [counselors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688836&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### People who are adjusting to the changes caused by cancer may have distress.

[Distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can occur when you feel you are unable to manage or control changes caused by cancer. People with the same [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treatment can have different levels of distress. People have less distress when they feel the demands of the diagnosis and treatment are low or the amount of support they get is high. For example, a [health care professional](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can help the person adjust to the [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by giving [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### People with cancer need different coping skills at different points in time.

Living with a diagnosis of cancer involves many life adjustments. Normal adjustment involves learning to cope with emotional distress and solve problems caused by having cancer.

The [coping skills](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) needed will change at different points in your cancer journey, such as when you:

- Hear the diagnosis.
- Receive cancer treatment.
- Finish cancer treatment.
- Learn that the cancer is in [remission](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45867&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Learn that the cancer has come back.
- Decide to stop cancer treatment.
- Become a cancer [survivor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Hearing the diagnosis

The process of adjusting to cancer begins before people hear the diagnosis. You may feel worried and afraid when you have unexplained [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or are having tests done to find out if you have cancer.

A diagnosis of cancer can cause people to have more distress when their fears become true. It may be difficult for people to understand what the doctors are telling them during this time. For more information, see [Communication in Cancer Care](/about-cancer/coping/adjusting-to-cancer/communication-pdq).

Additional help from health professionals for problems such as [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), trouble sleeping, and [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be needed during this time.

#### Being treated for cancer

As people go through cancer treatment, they use coping skills (also known as coping strategies) to adjust to the stress of treatment.

Adjusting to cancer treatment might involve coping skills that help the person change their thoughts or behaviors. For example, changing a daily routine or work schedule to manage the side effects of cancer treatment is a coping skill.

#### Remission after treatment

People will be glad when treatment has ended but may feel increased anxiety as they see their treatment team less often. Other concerns include returning to work and family life and being worried about any change in their health.

During remission, people may become distressed before [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) medical visits because they worry that the cancer has come back. Waiting for test results can be very stressful.

#### Learning that the cancer has come back

Cancer that comes back after treatment may cause an increase in distress from having:

- A return of symptoms.
- A sense of hopelessness.
- A negative view of the cancer or caregiving.

A person's [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be improved if they are able to manage their cancer and have support from friends and family.

#### Stopping cancer treatment

Sometimes cancer comes back or does not get better with treatment. The treatment plan then changes from one that is meant to [cure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the cancer to one that gives comfort and relieves symptoms. This may cause the person to have an increase in anxiety or depression. For more information, visit [Depression](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-pdq) and [Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal/ptsd-pdq).

People who adjust to the return of cancer often keep up hope in meaningful life activities. Some people look to [spirituality](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or religious beliefs to help keep up their quality of life. For more information, visit [Spirituality in Cancer Care](/about-cancer/coping/day-to-day/faith-and-spirituality/spirituality-pdq).

#### Becoming a long-term cancer survivor

People adjust to finishing cancer treatment and being long-term cancer survivors over many years. Some common problems reported by cancer survivors as they face the future include:

- Feeling anxious that the cancer will come back.
- Feeling a loss of control.
- Having anxiety and nausea in [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454799&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to reminders of chemotherapy (such as smells or sights).
- Having symptoms of [post-traumatic stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=770485&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as being unable to stop thinking about cancer or its treatment or feeling alone or separate from others.
- Feeling tired all of the time.
- Being concerned about [body image](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [sexuality](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476620&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Regular exercise and individual or group [counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help improve these problems and the person's quality of life.

Most people adjust well and some even say that surviving cancer has given them a greater appreciation for life, a better understanding of what is most important in their life, and stronger spiritual or religious beliefs.

Some people may have more trouble adjusting because of medical problems, fewer friends and family members who give support, money problems, or mental health problems not related to the cancer.

## Psychological and Social Distress

### Key Points

- Feelings of physical, emotional, social, or spiritual distress can make it hard to cope with cancer treatment.
- Different kinds of emotional and social support help with distress.

### Feelings of physical, emotional, social, or spiritual distress can make it hard to cope with cancer treatment.

Almost all people living with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have feelings of [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Feelings of distress range from sadness and fears to more serious problems such as [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [panic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454704&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), feeling uncertain about [spiritual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) beliefs, or feeling alone or separate from friends and family.

People who are in distress during any phase of cancer need treatment and support. People are more likely to need to be checked and treated for distress:

- Soon after [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- At the start of treatment.
- At the end of treatment.
- During [remission](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45867&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- If the cancer comes back.
- If the goal of treatment changes from [curing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or controlling cancer to [palliative therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to relieve [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and improve [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Different kinds of emotional and social support help with distress.

Studies have shown that people who are having trouble adjusting to cancer are helped by treatments that give them emotional and [social support](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including:

- [Relaxation training](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [talk therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=457962&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Cancer education sessions.
- [Existential therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797035&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (focuses on the human condition, including what humans are capable of, as well as their limitations).
- Social support in a group setting.

Benefits from these [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include having lower levels of depression, anxiety, and cancer- and treatment-related symptoms, as well as feeling more hopeful.

## Adjustment Disorders

### Key Points

- Adjustment disorders may cause serious problems in daily life.
- Counseling and other activities can help people with adjustment disorders.
- Counseling may be combined with antianxiety or antidepressant medicine.

### Adjustment disorders may cause serious problems in daily life.

An [adjustment disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occurs when a person's reaction to a [stressful](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) event:

- Is more severe than the expected amount of [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Affects relationships or causes problems at home or work.
- Includes [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other emotional, social, or behavioral problems.

Stressful events for people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), treatment, cancer [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and when [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occur. People who have trouble [coping](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with these events may develop an adjustment disorder. An adjustment disorder usually begins within 3 months of a stressful event.

### Counseling and other activities can help people with adjustment disorders.

Individual (one-to-one) and group [counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been shown to help people with cancer who have adjustment disorders. Counseling may include treatment that focuses on the person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Other activities that may help people cope include:

- [Relaxation training](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Cognitive behavior therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Problem-solving.
- Support from friends and family.
- [Meditation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=730354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Yoga](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=532135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Guided imagery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exercises.
- [Hypnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44675&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Positive thoughts about coping.
- Breathing exercises.

### Counseling may be combined with antianxiety or antidepressant medicine.

People who are having trouble adjusting to cancer should try counseling before [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Counseling may not help everyone, and some people may have a [mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disorder, such as severe anxiety or major depression. These people may need [antianxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=486601&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or antidepressant medicine along with counseling. Learn more about [Depression](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-pdq).

## Anxiety Disorders

### Key Points

- Anxiety disorders are strong fears that may be caused by physical or psychological stress.
- Anxiety disorders affect a person’s quality of life.
- There are different causes of anxiety disorders in people with cancer.
- There are different types of anxiety disorders.
- There are different kinds of treatment for anxiety disorders.
- Medicine may be used alone or combined with other types of treatment for anxiety disorders.

### Anxiety disorders are strong fears that may be caused by physical or psychological stress.

Studies show that almost half of all people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) say they feel some [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and about one-fourth of all people with cancer say they feel a great deal of anxiety. A person may become more anxious as cancer
spreads or treatment becomes more aggressive.

For some people, anxiety may feel like it is more than they can handle and this may affect their cancer treatment.

Symptoms of anxiety disorders include:

- Shortness of breath.
- Fast heartbeat.
- Sweating.
- Restlessness.
- Muscle tightness.
- Fainting or dizziness.
- [Nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Irritability.
- Fear that they are having a heart attack.
- Fear that they are "going crazy."

People are more likely to have anxiety disorders during cancer treatment if they have:

- A history of an anxiety disorder.
- A history of physical or emotional [trauma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Anxiety at the time of diagnosis.
- Few family members or friends to give them support.
- Severe pain or other physical symptoms that are not controlled well.
- Cancer that is not getting better with treatment.
- Trouble taking care of their personal needs such as bathing or eating.

### Anxiety disorders affect a person’s quality of life.

An anxiety disorder diagnosis is based on how [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of anxiety affect the person's [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), what kinds of symptoms began since the cancer diagnosis or treatment, when the symptoms occur, and how long they last.

Anxiety disorders can affect day-to-day life in many ways, such as:

- Feeling worried all the time.
- Not being able to learn new information.
- Not being able to "turn off thoughts" most of the time.
- Having trouble sleeping most nights.
- Crying frequently.
- Feeling afraid most of the time.
- Having symptoms such as fast heartbeat, dry mouth, shaky hands, restlessness, or feeling on edge.
- Having anxiety that is not relieved by [distraction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44663&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by staying busy.

### There are different causes of anxiety disorders in people with cancer.

In addition to anxiety caused by a cancer diagnosis, other causes of anxiety disorder in people with cancer may include:

- **Pain**: People with uncontrolled pain feel anxious, and
anxiety can increase pain.
- **Other medical problems**: [Sepsis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44348&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a low [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=538149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) level, heart failure, and [electrolyte](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44338&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) imbalances can also cause anxiety. Anxiety may be a warning sign of a change in [metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (such as low [blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), a heart attack, severe [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pneumonia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or a [blood clot](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476017&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **Certain types of tumors**: Certain [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [adrenal gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [thyroid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46036&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can cause symptoms of anxiety and [panic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454704&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) attacks. Tumors that have spread to the brain and [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
and tumors in the lungs can also cause symptoms of anxiety.
- **Taking certain drugs**: Certain types of [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including [corticosteroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [thyroxine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=533434&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bronchodilators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476099&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [antihistamines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468794&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), can cause restlessness, [agitation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462659&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or anxiety.
- **Withdrawing from habit-forming drugs**: Withdrawal from [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [nicotine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can cause agitation or anxiety.

Anxiety from these causes is usually managed by treating the cause of the anxiety.

### There are different types of anxiety disorders.

People who have intense fear, have trouble understanding information about their cancer, or are unable to cooperate with medical tests should be [screened](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for the following types of anxiety disorders:

- **[Phobias](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454806&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**. Phobias are fears about a situation or an object that lasts over time. People
with phobias usually feel intense anxiety and avoid the situation or object they are afraid of. Phobias may make it hard for people to follow through with tests and procedures or treatment. For example, people with a phobia of needle sticks may avoid having blood drawn for [laboratory tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46590&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **[Panic disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797033&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**. People with a panic disorder feel sudden intense anxiety, known as panic attacks. A panic attack usually lasts for 10 to 20 minutes, but the fear of having another panic attack may cause feelings of discomfort to continue for longer.
- **[Generalized anxiety disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476551&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**. People with a generalized anxiety disorder may feel extreme and constant anxiety or worry. A person who has generalized anxiety may feel irritable, restless, or dizzy, have tense muscles, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, sweating, or get tired quickly.
- **[Obsessive-compulsive disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454805&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (OCD)**. OCD is diagnosed when a person uses persistent (obsessive) thoughts, ideas, or images and [compulsions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (intentional repeated behaviors) to manage feelings of [distress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The obsessions and compulsions affect the person's ability to function at work, school, or in social situations. Examples of compulsions include frequent hand washing or door checking to make sure it is locked.

People with cancer who have OCD may be unable to follow through with treatment because of persistent thoughts and behaviors. They may also have obsessive thoughts about their cancer coming back. OCD is rare in people with cancer who did not have an anxiety disorder before being diagnosed with cancer.
- **Health anxiety disorder**. Cancer [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may develop health anxiety disorder related to their fears about their cancer coming back. This may include being highly alert to any possible physical symptoms, extreme focus on their cancer status, and requesting medical tests and visits with their doctor more often or earlier than needed.
- **[Post-traumatic stress disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440112&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**. Post-traumatic stress can come from feelings of shock, fear, helplessness, and horror at the time of cancer diagnosis. Learn more about [Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal/ptsd-pdq).

### There are different kinds of treatment for anxiety disorders.

People with anxiety disorders need information and
support to understand their cancer and treatment choices. Some helpful [psychological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatments may include:

- Individual (one-to-one) [counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450098&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Couple and family counseling.
- Crisis counseling.
- Group [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Self-help groups.
- [Cognitive behavior therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Relaxation training](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [hypnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44675&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [meditation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=730354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [guided imagery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [biofeedback](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44647&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Using different methods together may be helpful for some people. For more information, visit the [Psychological and Social Distress](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-pdq#_237) section.

### Medicine may be used alone or combined with other types of treatment for anxiety disorders.

[Antianxiety medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=486601&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used alone or combined with other psychological therapies. These medicines relieve symptoms of anxiety, such as feelings of fear, dread, uneasiness, and muscle tightness. They may relieve daytime distress and lessen trouble sleeping.

Studies show that [antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are useful in treating anxiety disorders. Children and teenagers being treated with antidepressants have an increased risk of thinking about [suicide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450124&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and must be watched closely.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about normal adjustment issues, and the pathophysiology and treatment of psychosocial distress and the adjustment disorders. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
