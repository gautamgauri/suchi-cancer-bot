# Cancer Survivorship - NCI

# Cancer Survivorship

A person is considered a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis through the balance of life. There are many types of survivors, including those living with cancer and those free of cancer. What being a survivor means to you may change over time, and some people might prefer another term entirely to describe themselves.

To learn about NCI survivorship research, see our [Office of Cancer Survivorship](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/) page.
