# Coping with Cancer for Young Adults

![Young woman on smartphone ](/pediatric-adult-rare-tumor/sites/g/files/xnrzdm221/files/styles/cgov_article/public/cgov_image/media_image/2019-09/teen%20on%20phone.jpg?itok=4oEvHkkD)

Young adults with cancer face different challenges than children or adults with cancer. Young adults may be concerned with how cancer can impact attending college, getting a job, or starting a family. As a young adult, you may be exploring your independence, but cancer may lead you to feel that independence has been taken away. There are several organizations, online forums, and other resources that can help you cope and find other young adults going through the same thing.
