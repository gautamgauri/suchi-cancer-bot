# Coping – Daily Life - NCI

# Daily Life During Cancer

Dealing with cancer is a life-changing event for most people. For many, it can be a time to minimize regrets and make new priorities. Try to live each day as normally as you can. Enjoy the simple things you like to do and take pleasure in big events.

You are not your cancer. Although you have to learn how to cope with the disease, you get to decide how you want to live the rest of your life. You can choose to live with hope.
