## General Information About Vulvar Cancer

[Go to Patient Version](/types/vulvar/patient/vulvar-treatment-pdq)

This summary addresses squamous cell cancer of the vulva and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). VIN may be a precursor to invasive squamous cell cancer.

About 50% of vulvar carcinomas arise in the labia majora, the most common site. The labia minora are the site of 15% to 20% of vulvar carcinoma cases. The clitoris and Bartholin glands are less frequently involved.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Lesions are multifocal in about 5% of cases. More than 90% of invasive vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

### Incidence and Mortality

Vulvar cancer accounts for about 6% of cancers of the female genital system in the United States.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

Estimated new cases and deaths from vulvar cancer in the United States in 2025:[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

- New cases: 7,480.
- Deaths: 1,770.

### Anatomy

The vulva is the area immediately external to the vagina, including the mons pubis, labia, clitoris, and Bartholin glands.

Also shown are the perineum and anus.")

Anatomy of the vulva. The vulva includes the mons pubis, clitoris, inner and outer lips of the vagina, and the openings of the urethra and vagina.

### Risk Factors

Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors associated with vulvar cancer include:

- Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: In many cases, the development of vulvar cancer is preceded by condyloma or
squamous dysplasia. The prevailing evidence favors HPV
infection as a causative factor in many genital tract carcinomas.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)]

HPV-associated VIN, termed *usual-type VIN* when high grades 2 and 3, is most common in women younger than 50 years, whereas non–HPV-associated VIN, termed *differentiated-type VIN* when high grade 3, is most common in older women.[[5](#cit/section_1.5),[6](#cit/section_1.6)]

The former lesion-type VIN grade 1 is no longer classified as a true VIN.[[5](#cit/section_1.5),[6](#cit/section_1.6)] The HPV-related basaloid and warty types are associated with VIN. About 75% to 100% of basaloid and warty carcinomas harbor HPV infection. In addition to the much higher prevalence of HPV in these subtypes than in the keratinizing subtypes, the basaloid and warty subtypes also share many common risk factors with cervical cancers, including:

- High number of sexual partners.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]
- Initiation of sexual intercourse at an early age.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]
- History of abnormal Pap smears.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]

For more information, see [Cervical Cancer Treatment](/types/cervical/hp/cervical-treatment-pdq).

### Clinical Features

Women with VIN may not present with symptoms at diagnosis.

Possible signs and symptoms of invasive squamous cell cancers of the vulva include:

- Vulvar lesion.
- Vulvar pruritus.
- Bleeding.
- Pain.

### Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation

The following procedures may be used to diagnose and stage vulvar cancer:

- Physical examination and history.
- Pelvic examination.
- Pap smear.
- HPV testing.
- Biopsy. The patient may be examined under anesthesia.
- Colposcopy.
- Imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography [CT], and positron emission tomography-CT).

### Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the pathological status of the inguinal lymph nodes and whether spread to adjacent structures has occurred.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)] In patients with operable disease without lymph node involvement, the overall survival (OS) rate is 90%. However,
in patients with nodal involvement, the 5-year OS rate is approximately 50%
to 60%.[[9](#cit/section_1.9)]

The size of the primary tumor is less important in defining prognosis.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)]

### Follow-Up After Treatment

Invasive and preinvasive neoplasms of the vulva may be HPV-induced, and the carcinogenic effect may be widespread in the vulvar epithelium. As a result, patients are monitored regularly for signs or symptoms of recurrence.

## Cellular Classification of Vulvar Cancer

The histological classification of vulvar
disease and precursor lesions of cancer of the vulva was developed by the
International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD).[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

**Nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of vulvar skin and mucosa**

- Lichen sclerosus (lichen sclerosus et atrophicus).
- Squamous cell hyperplasia (formerly hyperplastic dystrophy).
- Other dermatoses.

**Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)**

- Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) of the vulva (vulvar LSIL) encompasses flat condyloma or human papillomavirus effect.
- High-grade SIL (vulvar HSIL) was termed VIN, usual type in the 2004 ISSVD terminology.
- VIN, differentiated type.

**Paget disease of the vulva**

- Characteristic large pale cells in the epithelium and skin adnexa.

**Other histologies**

- Basal cell carcinoma.
- Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
- Malignant melanoma.
- Sarcoma.
- Verrucous carcinoma.

## Stage Information for Vulvar Cancer

The staging evaluation for vulvar cancer may include the following procedures:

- Cystoscopy.
- Proctoscopy.
- X-ray examination of the lungs.
- Intravenous (IV) urography (also known as IV pyelography).

Suspected bladder or rectal involvement
must be confirmed by biopsy.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

### The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) Staging

FIGO and the American Joint Committee on Cancer have designated staging to define vulvar cancer; the FIGO system is most commonly used.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Stage is based on pathological staging at the time of surgery or before any radiation or chemotherapy, if they are the initial treatment modalities.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)]

The staging system does not apply to malignant melanoma of the vulva, which is staged like melanoma of the skin.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] For more information, see the [Stage Information for Melanoma](/types/skin/hp/melanoma-treatment-pdq#_884) section in Melanoma Treatment.

| IV | | Tumor of any size fixed to bone, or fixed, ulcerated lymph node metastases, or distant metastases. |
| IVA | | Disease fixed to pelvic bone, **or** fixed or ulcerated regionalb lymph node metastases. |
| IVB | | Distant metastases. |

Grade is reported in registry systems and may differ between systems; a two-, three-, or four-grade system may be applied. If not specified, the following system is generally used:[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

- GX: Grade cannot be assessed.
- G1: Well differentiated.
- G2: Moderately differentiated.
- G3: Poorly differentiated.

Overall, about 30% of
patients with operable disease have lymph node spread. The pattern of spread is influenced by the histology. Risk factors for lymph node metastasis include:[[4](#cit/section_3.4)-[8](#cit/section_3.8)]

- Clinical node status.
- Age.
- Degree
of tumor differentiation.
- Tumor stage.
- Tumor thickness.
- Depth of stromal invasion.
- Presence of capillary-lymphatic space invasion.

Well-differentiated
lesions tend to spread along the surface with minimal invasion, whereas
anaplastic lesions are more likely to be deeply invasive. Spread beyond the
vulva is either to adjacent organs such as the vagina, urethra, and anus, or
via the lymphatics to the inguinal and femoral lymph nodes, followed by the deep
pelvic nodes. Hematogenous spread appears to be uncommon.

## Treatment Option Overview for Vulvar Cancer

The primary treatment for vulvar cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy is also given to patients with stage III or IV disease.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[3](#cit/section_4.3)] Newer strategies have integrated surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy and tailor the treatment to the extent of clinical and pathological disease. Patterns of practice in combining these treatments vary.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

Because there are few patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV), only limited data are available on treatment efficacy in this setting, and there is no standard chemotherapy regimen for these patients. Physicians may offer eligible patients with stage III or IV disease participation in clinical trials.

Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### Surgery

#### Surgical resection

Since the 1980s, the trend of surgical resection in patients with vulvar cancer has been toward more limited surgery, often combined with radiation therapy to minimize morbidity.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)] In tumors clinically confined to the vulva or perineum, radical local excision with a margin of at least 1 cm has generally replaced radical vulvectomy; separate incision has replaced en bloc inguinal lymph node dissection; ipsilateral inguinal node dissection has replaced bilateral dissection for laterally localized tumors; and femoral lymph node dissection has been omitted in many cases.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[5](#cit/section_4.5)-[7](#cit/section_4.7)] However, the different surgical techniques have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials. In addition, nonrandomized studies lack uniform staging definitions and clear descriptions of lymph node dissection or ancillary radiation.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)][Levels of evidence [C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English) and [C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The evidence base is, therefore, limited.

#### Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND)

Another strategy to minimize the morbidity incurred by groin lymph node dissection in patients with early clinical-stage disease is SLND, reserving groin dissection for those with metastases to the sentinel node(s).

Evidence (SLND):

1. In a multicenter case series, 403 patients with primary vulvar squamous cell cancers smaller than 4 cm and clinically negative groin lymph nodes underwent 623 SLNDs (using radioactive tracer and blue dye for sentinel node identification).[[9](#cit/section_4.9)] All patients had radical resection of the primary tumor. Node metastases were identified in 26% of SLND procedures, and these patients went on to full inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. The patients with negative sentinel nodes received no further therapy. After two local recurrences in 17 patients with multifocal primary tumors, the protocol was amended to allow only patients with unifocal tumors into the study.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Local morbidity was much lower in patients who underwent SLND than in patients with positive sentinel nodes who also underwent inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (see [Table 6](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_546)).

Table 6. Comparisona of Local Morbidity in Patients Treated With SLND Versus SLND and Inguinofemoral Lymphadenectomy

| Complications | Local Morbidity From SLND (%) | Local Morbidity From SLND and Inguinofemoral Lymphadenectomy (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SLND = Sentinel lymph node dissection. | | |
| a*P* < .0001 for all comparisons. | | |
| Wound breakdown | 11.7 | 34 |
| Cellulitis | 4.5 | 21.3 |
| Chronic lymphedema | 1.9 | 25.2 |
- The mean hospital stay was 8.4 days for patients who underwent SLND and 13.7 days for patients who underwent SLND and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (*P* < .0001).
- The actuarial groin recurrence rate for all patients with negative SLND results at 2 years was 3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%–6%) and 2% (95% CI, 1%–5%) for those with unifocal primary tumors.

SLND may be useful when performed by a surgeon experienced in the procedure, and it may avoid the need for full groin lymph node dissection or radiation therapy in patients with clinically nonsuspicious lymph nodes.

### Radiation Therapy

Radical radiation therapy can be used for patients unable to tolerate surgery or when surgery is not an option because of the site or extent of disease.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)-[13](#cit/section_4.13)]

Groin lymph node metastases are present in approximately 20% to 35% of patients with tumors clinically confined to the vulva and with clinically negative nodes.[[9](#cit/section_4.9),[14](#cit/section_4.14)] Lymph node dissection is traditionally part of the primary surgical therapy in all but the smallest tumors. Some investigators recommend radiation therapy as a means to avoid the morbidity of lymph node dissection, but it is not clear whether radiation therapy can achieve the same local control rates or survival rates as lymph node dissection in early-stage disease.

#### Localized node-negative disease

A randomized trial to address the efficacy of radiation therapy in patients with clinically localized vulvar cancer has been reported.[[14](#cit/section_4.14),[15](#cit/section_4.15)] In that study, women with disease clinically confined to the vulva, who did not have clinically suspicious groin lymph node metastases, underwent radical vulvectomy followed by either groin radiation (50 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction) or groin dissection (plus groin radiation if nodes were pathologically involved). Although the planned accrual was 300 patients, the study was stopped after 58 women were randomly assigned because of worse outcomes in the radiation therapy arm.

- Five of 27 (18.5%) women in the radiation therapy arm and 0 of 25 women in the groin dissection arm had a groin recurrence, but this difference was not statistically significant (relative risk [RR], 10.21; 95% CI, 0.59–175.78).
- There were ten deaths in the radiation therapy arm and three deaths in the groin dissection arm (RR, 4.31; 95% CI, 1.03–18.15).
- Disease-specific mortality was not statistically significantly different between the two arms. However, there were eight vulvar cancer–related deaths in the radiation therapy arm versus two vulvar cancer–related deaths in the groin dissection arm (including one related to the groin dissection surgery) (RR, 3.70; 95% CI, 0.87–15.80).[[14](#cit/section_4.14),[15](#cit/section_4.15)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- There were fewer cases of lymphedema (none in the radiation therapy arm vs. seven in the groin dissection arm) and shorter hospital stays in the radiation therapy arm. The dose penetration of the radiation (3 cm for full dose) has been criticized as inadequate.[[14](#cit/section_4.14)]

In summary, the trial was stopped prematurely, and little can be said about the relative efficacy of the two treatment approaches.[[14](#cit/section_4.14)]

#### Pelvic node–positive disease

Pelvic radiation therapy has been compared with pelvic node resection in patients with documented groin node–positive disease.

Evidence (pelvic node resection vs. pelvic radiation therapy):

1. Patients with clinical stage I to stage IV primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva in whom groin node metastases were found at radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin lymph node dissection were randomly assigned (during the surgical procedure) to receive either ipsilateral pelvic node resection or pelvic radiation therapy (45 Gy–50 Gy at 1.8 Gy–2.0 Gy per fraction).[[16](#cit/section_4.16)] Because of a perceived emerging benefit of radiation therapy, the planned accrual of 152 patients was stopped after 114 patients were randomly assigned. However, the apparent benefit of radiation was subsequently attenuated with further follow-up.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- After a median follow-up of 74 months, the 6-year overall survival (OS) rate was 51% in the pelvic radiation therapy arm versus 41% in the pelvic node resection arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.3–1.3; *P* = .18).
- Vulvar cancer–specific mortality was statistically significantly lower in the pelvic radiation therapy arm (29% in the pelvic radiation therapy arm vs. 51% in the pelvic node resection arm) (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28–0.87; *P* = .015). However, there were 14 intercurrent deaths in the pelvic radiation therapy arm versus two deaths in the pelvic node resection arm.
- Late chronic lymphedema was similar in both trial arms with 16% in the pelvic radiation therapy arm and 22% in the pelvic node resection arm.

### Chemotherapy

There is no standard chemotherapy for vulvar cancer, and reports describing the use of this modality in the setting of metastatic or recurrent disease are anecdotal.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

Extrapolating from regimens used for anal or cervical squamous cell cancers, chemotherapy has been studied in combination with radiation in the neoadjuvant setting or as primary therapy in advanced disease. Chemotherapy regimens have included various combinations of fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, mitomycin, or bleomycin.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

There is no clear evidence of improvement in survival or palliation. Given the advanced age and comorbidities of many patients with advanced or recurrent vulvar cancer, patient tolerance is a major consideration in the use of these agents.

#### Systemic treatment for inoperable patients

A systematic review of the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in patients who were considered inoperable or who would have required extensive surgery, such as pelvic exenteration, colostomy, or urinary diversion, revealed no randomized trials.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)] Five nonrandomized studies that met the inclusion criteria of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy administered in this population with an intent to permit curative surgery were reviewed.[[18](#cit/section_4.18)-[22](#cit/section_4.22)] The five studies used four different chemoradiation therapy schedules and different radiation therapy dose-fractionation techniques. In the four studies using 5-FU with either cisplatin or mitomycin, the operability rate after chemoradiation therapy ranged from 63% to 92%.[[18](#cit/section_4.18)-[21](#cit/section_4.21)] In the one study using bleomycin, the operability rate was only 20%.[[22](#cit/section_4.22)]

In summary, there is evidence that neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy with 5-FU plus either cisplatin or mitomycin may convert patients to a more operable status, but the evidence base is limited by study design. In addition to a paucity of randomized trials, interpretation of these studies is complicated by the lack of a standard definition of operability.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Treatment-related toxicity is substantial.

#### Systemic treatment for operable patients

There is limited evidence about the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in advanced operable vulvar cancer, and the available data do not suggest an advantage to this approach. A systematic review found only one randomized trial that addressed this issue, and it was published only in abstract form.[[4](#cit/section_4.4),[23](#cit/section_4.23)] In that trial, 68 patients with advanced vulvar cancer (T2\* >4 cm, T3\*, any case with positive lymph nodes) were randomly assigned to either receive preoperative neoadjuvant radiation therapy (50 Gy) concomitantly with 5-FU and mitomycin or primary surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy–related serious toxicity was high (13 of 24 patients; 10 patients had wound diastasis). After a mean follow-up of 42 months, the 5-year OS rate was 30% in the neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy arm and 49% in the primary surgery arm (RRdeath, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.94–2.06; *P* = .19).[[4](#cit/section_4.4),[23](#cit/section_4.23)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] [*Note: \*T2 is defined as tumor confined to the vulva and/or
perineum, more than 2 cm in greatest
dimension, and T3 is defined as tumor that invades any of the following: the
lower urethra, vagina, or anus.*]

#### Fluorouracil dosing

The *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[24](#cit/section_4.24),[25](#cit/section_4.25)] Patients with the *DPYD\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[24](#cit/section_4.24)-[26](#cit/section_4.26)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[27](#cit/section_4.27)-[29](#cit/section_4.29)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[30](#cit/section_4.30)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[31](#cit/section_4.31)]

## Treatment of Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia

### Treatment Options for Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN)

Treatment options for VIN include:

1. [Surgery](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_221).

- Separate excision of focal lesions.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]
- Wide local excision.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser surgery and vaporization.[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[3](#cit/section_5.3)] A disadvantage of vaporization is that it does not provide tissue for histological examination to confirm complete removal of the lesion and the absence of invasive disease.
- Ultrasonic surgical aspiration.[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[3](#cit/section_5.3)]
- Superficial skinning vulvectomy with or without grafting.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]
2. [Topical imiquimod](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_451) for patients who want to avoid surgery.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[8](#cit/section_5.8)]

Traditionally, there were three grades of VIN, however, there is little evidence that all three grades are part of the same biological continuum or that grade 1 is even a cancer precursor. In 2004, the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) changed its terminology, reserving the designation VIN for two categories of lesions based on morphological appearance.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)] In 2015, the ISSVD developed terminology for vulvar squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), which includes:[[10](#cit/section_5.10)]

- Low-grade SIL of the vulva (vulvar LSIL) encompasses flat condyloma or human papillomavirus effect.
- High-grade SIL (vulvar HSIL) was termed VIN, usual type in the 2004 ISSVD terminology.
- VIN, differentiated type.

High-grade VIN is usually managed with active therapy because of a higher risk for progression to invasive disease.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] Estimates of progression rates are imprecise. A systematic literature review that included 88 untreated patients with VIN 3 reported a 9% progression rate (8 of 88 patients) to invasive vulvar cancer during 12 to 96 months of observation. In the same review, the spontaneous regression rate was 1.2%, all of which occurred in women younger than 35 years.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] However, in a single-center study, 10 of 63 (16%) untreated women with VIN 2 or VIN 3 progressed to invasive cancer after a mean of 3.9 years.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)]

VIN lesions may be multifocal or confluent and extensive. It is important to perform multiple biopsies in treatment planning to exclude occult invasive disease. VIN located in nonhairy areas can be considered an epithelial disease; however, VIN found in hairy sites usually involves the pilosebaceous apparatus and requires a greater depth of excision because it can track along hair roots.

#### Surgery

The principal treatment approach is surgery, but there is no consensus on the optimal surgical procedure. The goal is to remove or destroy the entire VIN lesion while preserving vulvar anatomy and function. Simple vulvectomy yields a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100% but is
seldom indicated. Other more limited surgical procedures, including separate excision of multiple lesions, are less deforming.[[12](#cit/section_5.12)] The choice of treatment depends on the extent of the disease and the experience of the treating physician. There are no reliable data comparing the efficacy and safety of the various surgical approaches.

A systematic literature review identified only a single randomized trial comparing any of the surgical approaches.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] In that trial, 30 women with high-grade VIN were randomly assigned to either receive CO2 laser ablation or ultrasound surgical aspiration.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] There were no statistically significant differences in disease recurrence, painful dysuria or burning, adhesions, or eschar formation between the two treatments after 1 year of follow-up. Scarring was observed in 5 of 16 women treated with laser ablation and 0 of 14 women treated with ultrasound surgical aspiration (*P* < .01), but consequences of the scarring on sexual function or quality of life were not reported.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The trial was too small to draw reliable conclusions about the relative efficacy of these surgical techniques. The remainder of the surgical literature is derived from case series and is prone to important study biases.[[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Whatever procedure is used, patients are at substantial risk of recurrence, particularly when the lesions are high grade or multifocal.[[13](#cit/section_5.13)] The most common sites of recurrence are the perianal skin, presacral area, and clitoral hood. About 4% of patients treated for VIN subsequently develop invasive cancer.[[14](#cit/section_5.14),[15](#cit/section_5.15)]

#### Nonsurgical interventions

##### Topical imiquimod

Among women with high-grade VIN, substantial response rates and acceptable tolerability were reported for topical imiquimod 5%, an immune-response modifier with activity in human papillomavirus types 6- and 11-associated vulvar condylomata.

Evidence (imiquimod):

1. Three randomized placebo-controlled trials (including a total of 104 patients) with clinical response as the primary end points have been reported in either peer-reviewed-journals or in abstract format.[[7](#cit/section_5.7)];[[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[6](#cit/section_5.6)][[Level of evidence B3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810031&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The results of these trials were summarized in a systematic review.[[8](#cit/section_5.8)]

- At 5 to 6 months, the complete response rates in patients were 36 of 62 in the combined imiquimod arm versus 0 of 42 in the combined placebo arm, and the partial response rates were 18 of 62 in the combined imiquimod arm versus 1 of 42 in the combined placebo arm (relative risk, 11.95; 95% confidence interval, 3.21–44.51).
- In the only trial reporting progression to cancer at 12 months, there was no difference in progression rate, but the trial was severely underpowered because only 3 of the total 52 women developed invasive disease by 12 months.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)]
- The only trial reporting quality of life [[6](#cit/section_5.6)] showed no difference between imiquimod and placebo.
- Local side effects of imiquimod included pain, edema, erythema, and a single case of erosion. However, no patients had to discontinue treatment as a result of toxicity.

##### Other nonsurgical interventions

Nonsurgical approaches have been studied because of the physical and psychosexual morbidity associated with many vulvar surgical procedures. Some of these approaches, including topical fluorouracil, recombinant interferon gamma, bleomycin, and trinitrochlorobenzene, have been largely abandoned because of high recurrence rates or intolerable local side effects, such as pain, irritation, and ulceration.[[8](#cit/section_5.8),[16](#cit/section_5.16)]

Photodynamic therapy, using topically applied 5-aminolevulinic acid as the sensitizing agent for 635 nm laser light, has also been studied. However, data are limited to small case series with variable response rates.[[17](#cit/section_5.17),[18](#cit/section_5.18)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Treatment of Stages I and II Vulvar Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stages I and II Vulvar Cancer

Treatment options for [stage I](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_556) and [stage II vulvar cancer](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_557) include:

1. [Surgery](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_456).
2. [Surgery and radiation therapy](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_460).
3. [Radiation therapy alone](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_462).

#### Surgery

Radical local excision with ipsilateral or bilateral inguinal and femoral lymph node dissection may be indicated. For stage I microinvasive lesions (<1 mm invasion) with no associated severe
vulvar dystrophy, a wide (1 cm margin) excision (without lymph node dissection) may be done. For all
other stage I lesions, if well lateralized, without diffuse severe dystrophy,
and with clinically negative nodes, a radical local excision with complete
unilateral lymphadenectomy may be done.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] Candidates for this
procedure should have lesions 2 cm or smaller in diameter with 5
mm or less invasion, no capillary-lymphatic space invasion, and
clinically uninvolved nodes.[[2](#cit/section_6.2),[3](#cit/section_6.3)]

For stage II disease, large T2\* tumors may require modified radical vulvectomy or radical vulvectomy.[[4](#cit/section_6.4)] [*Note: \*T2 is defined as tumor confined to the vulva and/or
perineum, more than 2 cm in greatest
dimension.*]

For both stage I and stage II disease, radical local excision and sentinel node dissection is indicated and groin dissection is reserved for those with metastasis to the sentinel node(s).[[5](#cit/section_6.5)]

#### Surgery and radiation therapy

Some investigators recommend radical excision and groin nodal radiation therapy as a means to avoid the morbidity of lymph node dissection. However, it is not clear whether radiation therapy can achieve the same local control rates or survival rates as lymph node dissection in early-stage disease. A randomized trial to address this issue in patients with clinically localized vulvar disease was stopped early as a result of early emergence of worse outcomes in the radiation therapy arm.[[6](#cit/section_6.6),[7](#cit/section_6.7)] For stage II disease, adjuvant local radiation therapy may be indicated for surgical margins smaller than 8 mm, capillary-lymphatic space invasion, and thickness greater than 5 mm.[[8](#cit/section_6.8),[9](#cit/section_6.9)]

#### Radiation therapy alone

For patients unable to tolerate radical surgery or deemed
ineligible for surgery because of the site or extent of disease, radical radiation
therapy may be associated with favorable survival.[[10](#cit/section_6.10)-[13](#cit/section_6.13)]

## Treatment of Stage III Vulvar Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stage III Vulvar Cancer

Treatment options for [stage III vulvar cancer](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_558) include:

1. [Surgery with or without radiation therapy](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_473).
2. [Radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_476).
3. [Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_478).

#### Surgery with or without radiation therapy

Modified radical or radical vulvectomy with inguinal and femoral lymphadenectomy is the standard
therapy.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)]
Nodal involvement is a key determinant of survival.
Radiation therapy is given to patients with large primary lesions and
narrow margins.
Radiation therapy to the pelvis and groin is given if inguinal lymph nodes are
positive.[[2](#cit/section_7.2)] Radiation therapy to the pelvis and groin is usually given if two or more
groin nodes are involved.[[2](#cit/section_7.2),[3](#cit/section_7.3)]

Localized adjuvant radiation therapy consisting of 45 Gy to 50 Gy
may also be indicated when there is capillary-lymphatic space invasion and a
thickness of greater than 5 mm, particularly if the nodes are
involved.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)]

#### Radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery

Preoperative neoadjuvant radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy may be used to improve
operability and even decrease the extent of surgery required.[[4](#cit/section_7.4)-[10](#cit/section_7.10)]

#### Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy

For patients unable to tolerate radical surgery or deemed ineligible for surgery because of the site or extent of disease, radical radiation therapy may be associated with long-term survival.[[11](#cit/section_7.11),[12](#cit/section_7.12)] Some physicians prefer to add concurrent fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5-FU and cisplatin.[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[13](#cit/section_7.13)]

## Treatment of Stage IVA Vulvar Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stage IVA Vulvar Cancer

Treatment options for [stage IVA vulvar cancer](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_559) include:

1. [Surgery](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_482).
2. [Surgery and radiation therapy](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_484).
3. [Radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_486).
4. [Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_488).

#### Surgery

Radical vulvectomy and pelvic exenteration may be indicated for patients with stage IVA vulvar cancer.

#### Surgery and radiation therapy

Surgery followed by radiation therapy may be done for large resected
lesions with narrow margins. Localized adjuvant radiation therapy consisting
of 45 Gy to 50 Gy may also be indicated when there is capillary-lymphatic space
invasion and thickness greater than 5 mm.[[1](#cit/section_8.1)] Radiation therapy to the pelvis and groin is given if two or
more groin lymph nodes are involved.[[2](#cit/section_8.2),[3](#cit/section_8.3)]

#### Radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery

Neoadjuvant radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy of large primary lesions (to improve operability) may be done, followed by
radical surgery.[[4](#cit/section_8.4)-[10](#cit/section_8.10)]

#### Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy

For patients unable to tolerate radical vulvectomy or who are deemed
ineligible for surgery because of the site or extent of disease, radical radiation
therapy may be associated with long-term survival.[[11](#cit/section_8.11),[12](#cit/section_8.12)] When radiation therapy is
used for primary definitive treatment of vulvar cancer, some physicians prefer to
add concurrent fluorouracil (5-FU) or 5-FU and cisplatin.[[1](#cit/section_8.1),[13](#cit/section_8.13)-[17](#cit/section_8.17)]

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. [General information](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials") about clinical trials is also available.

## Treatment of Stage IVB Vulvar Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stage IVB Vulvar Cancer

There is no standard treatment approach in the management of [stage IVB vulvar cancer](/types/vulvar/hp/vulvar-treatment-pdq#_559).

Local therapy must be individualized depending on the extent of local and metastatic disease.

There is no standard chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and reports describing the use of this modality are anecdotal.[[1](#cit/section_9.1)] However, by largely extrapolating from regimens used for anal or cervical cancer, chemotherapy has been studied. Regimens have included various combinations of fluorouracil, cisplatin, mitomycin, or bleomycin.[[1](#cit/section_9.1)-[3](#cit/section_9.3)] Given the advanced age and comorbidity of many patients with advanced or recurrent vulvar cancer, patient tolerance is a major consideration in the use of these agents.

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria.

## Treatment of Recurrent Vulvar Cancer

### Treatment Options for Recurrent Vulvar Cancer

Treatment options for recurrent vulvar cancer include:

1. Wide local excision with or without radiation therapy in patients with local
recurrence.
2. Radical vulvectomy and pelvic exenteration in patients with local recurrence.
3. Synchronous radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without surgery.[[1](#cit/section_10.1)]

Treatment and outcome depend on the site and extent of
recurrence.[[2](#cit/section_10.2)] Radical excision of localized recurrence may be considered if technically feasible.[[3](#cit/section_10.3)] Palliative radiation therapy is used for some patients. Radiation
therapy with or without chemotherapy may be associated with substantial disease-free periods in some patients with a small
local recurrence.[[1](#cit/section_10.1),[4](#cit/section_10.4),[5](#cit/section_10.5)] When local recurrence occurs more than 2 years after
primary treatment, a combination of radiation therapy and surgery may result in
a 5-year survival rate of greater than 50%.[[6](#cit/section_10.6),[7](#cit/section_10.7)]
