## Introduction

Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 2 (RTPS2) is caused by [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (or [hereditary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45983&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) loss-of-function [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in the *SMARCA4* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), which is located on [chromosome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) 19p13.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] RTPS2 is an [autosomal dominant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793860&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) disorder. Individuals with *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants have an increased risk to develop small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and, rarely, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). The risk of developing extracranial rhabdoid tumors and other rare tumors is currently unknown. Germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been identified in individuals with neuroblastoma, suggesting that *SMARCA4* could also be a neuroblastoma [susceptibility gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460209&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

## Nomenclature for Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 2

Individuals who harbor [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *SMARCA4* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) have rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 2 (RTPS2).[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] Nomenclature for genetic disorders continues to evolve. Future terminology for these disorders may reflect the proposed dyadic naming approach, incorporating [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and [phenotype](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

## Genetics of Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 2

### Molecular Genetics of Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 2 (RTPS2)

The *SMARCA4* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) encodes the SMARCA4 protein (also called BRG1), a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which helps control gene [transcription](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). Individuals with [deleterious](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=556486&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic)  [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *SMARCA4* [variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (typically loss-of-function variants) are diagnosed with RTPS2. In RTPS2, tumor development follows the Knudson two-hit hypothesis, in which tumors are driven by the inactivation of both copies of the *SMARCA4* gene. Inactivation of *SMARCA4* nearly always results in loss of SMARCA4/BRG1 protein expression. Rare cases of small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) have been described with retained SMARCA4 immunoreactivity, despite the presence of *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants or [loss of heterozygosity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=464169&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) detected via molecular testing.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

While most hereditary non-SCCOHT rhabdoid tumor cases are caused by *SMARCB1* pathogenic variants and lead to rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome type 1 (RTPS1), approximately 2% to 3% of rhabdoid tumor cases are caused by *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Intracranial atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are seen more often than extracranial rhabdoid tumors in people with RTPS2.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] Data are scarce, given the rarity of *SMARCA4*-associated AT/RTs. However, it has been suggested that the rate of germline cases is higher in *SMARCA4*-associated AT/RTs than in those with loss of SMARCB1.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] Germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants associated with RTPS2 lead to a loss of function, most often via [nonsense variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783965&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and intragenic [deletions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460141&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).

On the other hand, germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants are detected in approximately 40% of women with SCCOHT, a rare and aggressive tumor. Somatic variation in these tumors is typically caused by nonsense or [frameshift](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783963&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) variants. However, loss of the short arm of chromosome 19 and [missense variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783964&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) have also been seen.[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[6](#cit/section_3.6)] Some investigators have suggested that SCCOHT be called malignant rhabdoid tumor of the ovary (MRTO) and be included in the group of RTPS2-associated tumors.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)]

### Inheritance of RTPS2

RTPS2 is an [autosomal dominant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793860&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) cancer predisposition disorder. The [penetrance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) of RTPS2 appears to be incomplete. Studies using population-scale genomic ascertainment have not been conducted. Data suggest that *SMARCA4* variants in RTPS2 are inherited more often than *SMARCB1* variants in RTPS1. In a small cohort study, six of seven patients inherited *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants from an unaffected parent.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] It is recommended that family members of *SMARCA4* carriers consider genetic testing. Testing is also recommended for affected patients.[[7](#cit/section_3.7)]

### Related Conditions

Germline *SMARCA4* variants have also been identified in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS).[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] However, unlike loss-of-function *SMARCA4* variants in RTPS2, individuals with CSS typically have nontruncating missense *SMARCA4* variants. In a patient with a germline nonsense *SMARCA4* variant, a mild CSS presentation and a SCCOHT diagnosis were described.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] However, individuals with CSS who carry nontruncating *SMARCA4* variants are not at risk of developing rhabdoid tumors.

## Cancer Risks, Spectrum, and Characteristics of Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 2

Up to 40% of females with small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) harbor [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *SMARCA4* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)] Multiple family members can be affected.[[3](#cit/section_4.3)] In women with SCCOHT who did not have germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants, one [somatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=781854&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *SMARCA4* variant was almost always found.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] A retrospective review of 48 SCCOHT tumors sequenced at a diagnostic lab found 18 tumors (37.5%) with germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants. The remainder were somatic *SMARCA4* variants, indeterminate, or unknown. The ages of the 48 women ranged from 8 years to 56 years (median age, 28.5 y).[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] A retrospective review of the Slovenian Cancer Registry identified seven SCCOHT cases from 1991 to 2021 in a country with about 2 million people, giving a minimal SCCOHT incidence of 0.12 cases per 1 million people per year. Of the seven cases, four harbored germline loss-of-function *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants. Three tumors harbored somatic *SMARCA4* loss-of-function variants. Six of the seven women died of SCCOHT within 27 months of their diagnoses.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)] Ages of people diagnosed with SCCOHT ranged from infancy to 56 years, with an average age of 23.9 years. [Penetrance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) was uncertain but may be considerable. There are known unpublished and published cases of women in their 50s (and older) with germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants who remain cancer free.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

Inactivating *SMARCA4* variants have been reported in a rare, aggressive form of uterine sarcoma seen in young women, called *SMARCA4*-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (*SMARCA4*-DUS), also known as a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the uterus.[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[7](#cit/section_4.7)] A retrospective review of 17 *SMARCA4*-DUS tumors sequenced at a diagnostic lab found two tumors (11.8%) with germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants. The remainder were somatic *SMARCA4* variants, indeterminate, or unknown. The ages of the two women were 40 years and 55 years.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

Germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants are rarely found in individuals with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs). *SMARCA4*-altered AT/RTs may be associated with worse prognoses.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)] Risk of other rhabdoid tumors is unknown but likely low.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)] At least one case report described an unusual lung cancer in a child with a *SMARCA4* pathogenic variant.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)]

Clinically aggressive *SMARCA4*-deficient thoracic sarcomas (*SMARCA4*-DTS) have been described in adults (typically male smokers), but germline *SMARCA4* variants have not been reported.[[11](#cit/section_4.11)-[14](#cit/section_4.14)]

[Heterozygous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339341&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants were reported in 11 individuals with neuroblastoma (eight previously reported cases and four new cases). Nine of these individuals were male. The median age of diagnosis was 5 years (range, 2 mo–26 y), and all but one patient presented in the pediatric age range. Of the 11 patients, one child aged 4 years presented with bilateral neuroblastoma. This child also had a germline *CHEK2* pathogenic variant. Eight of nine *SMARCA4* variants were expected to result in a loss-of-function variant. The remaining four *SMARCA4* variants were [missense](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783964&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). There was no clear difference in age of diagnosis between individuals with missense and loss-of-function variants. In the four patients who had *MYCN* status tested, none showed *MYCN* amplification. None of the 11 individuals were known to have family histories of *SMARCA4*-related tumors. In eight cases where somatic testing was performed, [loss of heterozygosity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=464169&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) was observed, which provides additional support that *SMARCA4* is a [tumor suppressor.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46657&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) [[15](#cit/section_4.15)]

## Management of Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 2

### Genetic Counseling of Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 2 (RTPS2)

It is recommended that any female with (1) a personal diagnosis or family history of small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) or (2) a personal diagnosis or family history of other rhabdoid tumors receive [genetic counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and be offered *SMARCA4* genetic testing. Related boys younger than 5 years are recommended to undergo rhabdoid tumor screening and *SMARCA4* [cascade genetic testing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799496&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). It is also appropriate to offer *SMARCA4* genetic testing to unaffected males older than 5 years who have family histories of rhabdoid tumors or SCCOHT in female family members. These men may be obligate carriers, and screening recommendations would apply to their children.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] Shared decision making can be considered (regarding the timing of genetic testing) for boys between the ages of 5 and 18 years, since screening recommendations do not exist for boys older than 5 years. Clinicians must respect the individual's right to choose  [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) genetic testing.

### Surveillance of RTPS2

In 2017, experts in childhood cancer genetics created the first recommendations for cancer [surveillance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=496506&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndromes. These recommendations were updated in 2024.[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[3](#cit/section_5.3)]

Optimal surveillance recommendations for children with RTPS2 have not been established and may be burdensome for many families. For boys and girls younger than 5 years, surveillance of the craniospinal axis is recommended every 4 to 6 weeks from birth to 6 months, then every 3 months until age 5 years, after which surveillance ceases. Clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound are conducted every 3 months until the age of 5 years, when abdominal surveillance stops for boys. For girls, abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds are recommended every 6 months, with no age limit. Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound is a limited surveillance strategy for detecting low-stage SCCOHT that is amenable to curative surgical resection. This surveillance technique has not been validated in patients with *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants.[[3](#cit/section_5.3),[4](#cit/section_5.4)] Alternative recommendations have been made for risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in first-degree relatives of women diagnosed with SCCOHT. However, timing of such surgeries in girls and young women is challenging to determine.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)-[7](#cit/section_5.7)] Case reports indicated that when young women or girls were affected by SCCOHT, there was a greater impetus for risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, particularly in siblings.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[8](#cit/section_5.8)]

### Surveillance in Survivorship of RTPS2

For women and girls with SCCOHT, the overall survival rate is approximately 51% for patients with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) stage I disease and decreases to 24% for patients with stage II to stage IV disease.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)] Since treatment for SCCOHT is surgical removal of the ovary, it is recommended that female patients with germline *SMARCA4* pathogenic variants have all ovarian tissue removed (removal of both ovaries plus any localized/metastatic disease, like omental studding) and receive adjuvant chemotherapy.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] Surveillance imaging would therefore default to long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of ovarian cancer, as outlined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)]

For children younger than 5 years who have been diagnosed with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor or malignant rhabdoid tumor, surveillance of unaffected organs can be continued during primary cancer treatment and posttherapy surveillance.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)]

### Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition and Fertility Preservation

RTPS2 presents unique challenges for fertility preservation in women or girls affected by SCCOHT. Prophylactic risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for individuals with a high risk of developing SCCOHT. Women or girls with RTPS2 may engage with their institutional fertility preservation program to determine eligibility for egg or ovarian tissue banking. However, published data suggest that the cell of origin for SCCOHT may be a germ cell, raising uncertainty about this approach.[[12](#cit/section_5.12)] Genetic counseling and consideration of preimplantation genetic testing of embryos is advisable.
