## Introduction and Clinical Manifestations of CEBPA-Associated Familial Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

The *CEBPA* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) is a granulocytic [transcription](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) factor (C/EBPα) that serves an important role in myeloid cell differentiation. Somatic mutations in *CEBPA* occur in approximately 10% to 15% of all AML cases. The presence of two somatic mutations in *CEBPA* (also known as *CEBPA*dm) is recognized as a unique clinical entity associated with favorable outcomes, even in the event of relapse.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Germline pathogenic variants in *CEBPA* were reported in 2004 in a family with hereditary, nonsyndromic AML.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] *CEBPA*-associated [familial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460148&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) AML (also known as familial AML with a *CEBPA* [variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic)) became the second [autosomal dominant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793860&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) AML [predisposition syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754220&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) described (*RUNX1*-familial platelet disorder was the first).[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

Features of *CEBPA*-associated familial AML include the following:

- **Highly [penetrant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic):** Unlike several other myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/AML predisposition syndromes, germline *CEBPA* pathogenic variants appear to be highly penetrant, conferring greater than a 90% lifetime risk to develop AML.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)-[6](#cit/section_1.6)]
- **Early-onset AML:** Germline *CEBPA* pathogenic variants are associated with early-onset AML that can occur in childhood.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)] Published research on families with *CEBPA* germline pathogenic variants have reported that AML onset can occur between the ages of 1.75 to 46 years.
- **De novo AML:** Inherited *CEBPA* pathogenic variants can predispose individuals to de novo AML without prior prolonged antecedent cytopenias or multilineage dysplasia.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]
- **AML similar to somatic *CEBPA* variant(s):** The characteristics of AML arising from a germline *CEBPA* pathogenic variant are strikingly similar to the characteristics seen in patients with somatic *CEBPA* mutation(s). These include the following: normal [cytogenetics](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270737&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), French-American-British (FAB) AML subtypes M1 and M2, numerous Auer rods seen in peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts, and aberrant CD7 expression detected by flow cytometry.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)]

## Genetics and Molecular Biology of CEBPA-Associated Familial Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

The *CEBPA* gene is located on [chromosome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) 19q13.1. Leukemia arising from an [inherited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *CEBPA* [pathogenic variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) follows a two-hit mechanism of leukemogenesis. Germline *CEBPA* pathogenic [variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) cluster in the N-terminus (5’ end) of the *CEBPA* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). The second [somatic variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=781854&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (at the C-terminus; 3’ end) is acquired on the other *CEBPA* [allele](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339337&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (in trans) when leukemia develops.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)] Interestingly, while the same germline pathogenic variants are present in multiple family members, individuals within families acquire distinct somatic variants in the C-terminus region of *CEBPA*. In some cases, more than one C-terminus variant can be acquired, suggesting two distinct episodes of AML in one individual.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)] Patients with *CEBPA* germline pathogenic variants often acquire *GATA2* somatic variants when they develop AML.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)]

The prevalence of *CEBPA*-associated [familial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460148&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) AML, like that of many other inherited AML [predisposition syndromes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754220&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), is unknown. However, germline *CEBPA* pathogenic variants may account for up to 1% of all AML cases, as extrapolated from somatic testing data.[[5](#cit/section_2.5),[6](#cit/section_2.6)] In one series, 2 of 18 patients (11%) with AML and a somatic *CEBPA* variant (also called *CEBPA*-mutated AML) were found to carry germline pathogenic variants in the N-terminus of *CEBPA*.[[7](#cit/section_2.7)] In a second study, 5 of 71 patients (7%) with *CEBPA*-mutated AML carried a *CEBPA* germline pathogenic variant, suggesting that approximately 10% of individuals with [biallelic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *CEBPA*-mutated AML harbor germline pathogenic variants in *CEBPA*.[[8](#cit/section_2.8)] Therefore, genetic testing for *CEBPA* germline pathogenic variants is indicated in any patient who presents with AML and *CEBPA* somatic variants (particularly biallelic *CEBPA* somatic variants).

## Management and Prognosis for CEBPA-Associated Familial Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

*CEBPA*-associated [familial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460148&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) AML is similar to [sporadic AML](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339347&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) with somatic [biallelic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *CEBPA* [variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in that both often have a favorable prognosis and preclude the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, in individuals with AML arising from a [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *CEBPA* [pathogenic variant,](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) the HSCT’s purpose is to both treat the AML and to replace the constitutional stem cell population that harbors the AML susceptibility.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Like in all [inherited predispositions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) to AML, great care needs to be taken to avoid use of a stem cell donor who carries a germline *CEBPA* pathogenic variant. Donor-derived leukemia has been reported in individuals with *CEBPA*-associated familial AML who received a transplant, unknowingly, from a donor who carried a *CEBPA* germline pathogenic variant.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)]
