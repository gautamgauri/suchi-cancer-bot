## Introduction

[Inherited predisposition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) syndromes that lead to hereditary hematologic malignancy (HHM) are increasingly being recognized.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)-[4](#cit/section_1.4)] These syndromes were originally thought to be rare. However, recent estimates suggest that more than 10% of all hematologic malignancies (HM) may have an inherited component. The presentations of HHM syndromes occur on a spectrum. They can occur during childhood with conditions like inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, or they can occur in adulthood with conditions like *DDX41*-associated myeloid cancers, in which malignancy occurs at a median age of 68 years. Updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HMs (i.e., the World Health Organization, International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias [ICC], and European LeukemiaNet [ELN] guidelines) now include genetic testing considerations for HHM. Genetic testing for HHM is often challenging because it can be difficult to obtain a normal [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) control tissue sample, such as a skin biopsy, to confirm the hereditary nature of a predisposing [pathogenic variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a curative treatment for many HMs. However, timely diagnosis of an HHM is essential for evaluation and management. Timely diagnosis allows for the identification of optimal transplant donors who are related to the patient (i.e., family members who are HSCT matches but do not have the same HHM), the selection of appropriate cytoreductive therapy, and the transplant conditioning regimen.

## Natural History of Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies

Since [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) hematologic malignancy (HM) syndromes are rare and heterogenous, data on their natural histories are scarce. Initial hematologic manifestations in hereditary hematologic malignancy (HHM) syndromes can range from thrombocytopenia (in *RUNX1*-, *ETV6*-, *ANKRD26*-, and MECOM-associated syndromes), leukopenia and monocytopenia (in GATA2 deficiency syndrome), multilineage cytopenia (in classical inherited bone marrow failure syndromes), and B-cell or natural killer cell lymphopenias (caused by [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in several different [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic)).[[1](#cit/section_2.1)-[9](#cit/section_2.9)] The progression from initial hematologic manifestations to an HM is typically gradual, with varying latency periods occurring from birth to leukemia development. Many patients exhibit dysplasia in the bone marrow or clonal genetic/[cytogenetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270737&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) aberrations, which can eventually lead to HMs.

In some pathogenic variant carriers of HHM syndromes, initial manifestations may include extra-hematopoietic abnormalities, such as the following:

- Constitutional and [congenital](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460137&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) defects (i.e., intrauterine growth restriction; failure to thrive; and skeletal, cardiac, urogenital, mucocutaneous, vascular, or neurological abnormalities).
- Increased sensitivity to chemotherapy (manifests as delayed blood count recovery or increased toxicity).
- Atypical systemic infections.
- Increased risk of solid tumors.

Complications of infection and malignancy risk increase with patient age and are the main causes of mortality in this population. These factors must be considered when selecting management strategies, which can include watchful waiting, supportive care, or curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Various disease aspects are gene- or [variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic)-specific, including risks to develop HMs and the heterogenous spectrum of acquired events that can occur (which may include cytogenic changes, leukemia driver variants and somatic genetic rescue events during hematopoiesis). However, the natural histories of these syndromes are often unpredictable, with identical pathogenic variants resulting in both indolent or rapidly progressing disease in different individuals. These differences are likely due to unknown disease-modifying factors.

## Risk Factors for Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies

Several environmental, occupational, and iatrogenic exposures increase the risk of developing hematologic malignancies (HMs) in the general population. These factors likely further increase risk in individuals with a [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) predisposition to HM, although the precise interactions between these exposures and germline hereditary hematologic malignancies (HHMs) are not well known. For more information about risk factors for HMs in the general population, see the [Risk Factors](/types/myeloproliferative/hp/myelodysplastic-treatment-pdq#_299) section in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Treatment.

Examples of exposures that increase risk for HMs include benzene (and other organic solvents), pesticides, radiation, and chemotherapy.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] The latency period between initial exposure and diagnosis of a secondary HM is 2 to 3 years for patients who were exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors and 5 to 7 years for those who were exposed to alkylating agents or radiation therapy.

Patients with [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) repair disorders, like Fanconi anemia, have very high risks of developing secondary malignancies after radiation or chemotherapy, and these malignancies often progress rapidly.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] Patients with germline *RUNX1* and *CEBPA* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) who are treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have very high rates of relapse and AML recurrence after initial rounds of chemotherapy.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] A family history of HMs (even in the absence of a known, single-[gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) Mendelian [hereditary predisposition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809370&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic)) significantly increases an individual's risk of developing an HM.[[5](#cit/section_3.5)] This increase is likely caused by shared genetic and environmental risk factors.

## Prevalence of Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies

The prevalence of [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) predisposition syndromes is increasingly being recognized in individuals with hematologic malignancies (HM). The prevalence of these predisposition syndromes continues to be studied and defined. It varies widely depending on the patient’s clinical diagnosis, age, and family history. A germline predisposition is estimated to underlie 10% to 20% of HM cases across the lifespan.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[11](#cit/section_4.11)] Studies of pediatric HM/bone marrow failure (BMF) cohorts suggest that 10% to 30% of diagnoses are caused by underlying germline [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), typically in [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) like *SAMD9*, *SAMD9L*, *GATA2*, genes in the Fanconi anemia pathway, and genes involved in [telomere](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643091&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) biology. The prevalence of [inherited predisposition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) syndromes in adult-onset HM/BMF is less understood, but evidence is growing as genetic testing is offered to a growing number of [affected individuals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460124&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). Recent studies imply that approximately 10% to 20% of [familial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460148&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) myeloid malignancies, like acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), are inherited. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly common to diagnose a BMF syndrome (typically with pediatric onset), such as Fanconi anemia or a telomere biology disorder, in an adult whose personal and family history may not align with conventional descriptions of the [phenotype](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).

Importantly, somatic testing (which is routinely performed on individuals with HMs), may detect pathogenic variants that originate in the germline. Additionally, several genomic features are [pathognomonic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454769&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) for certain germline pathogenic variants associated with hereditary hematologic malignancies (HHMs). In one study, 94% (33/35) of patients with somatic *DDX41* variants that exceeded a 40% variant [allele](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339337&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) frequency harbored a germline *DDX41* pathogenic variant.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)] When a *DDX41* p.R525H variant presented in trans with another *DDX41* variant, it was especially indicative of a germline *DDX41* pathogenic variant. Another study of pediatric (<18 y) MDS showed that 8% of patients carried a germline *SAMD9/9L* pathogenic variant, and 7% (38/548) carried a germline *GATA2* pathogenic variant.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)] In contrast, many of the genes implicated in inherited HM predisposition may also acquire [somatic pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=781854&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), which can be detected in the bone marrow or peripheral blood at varying allele frequencies. Follow-up germline evaluation can be helpful to discern the genomic origin of these pathogenic variants. The understanding of somatic and germline variants in HM and the way that these variants interact is expected to evolve since several studies on this topic are ongoing.

## Risk Assessment and Genetic Testing for Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies

### Considerations for Risk Assessment and Identification of Individuals at Risk for Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies (HHM)

It is recommended that thorough personal and family histories be obtained for all patients who present with hematologic malignancies (HMs).[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] Some disorders are associated with specific hematologic or nonhematologic disease manifestations. For example, [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *RUNX1*, *ETV6*, and *ANRKD26* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) are associated with lifelong mild- to moderate-thrombocytopenia and qualitative platelet deficits. Other germline pathogenic variants, like those in *GATA2*, *SAMD9*, and *SAMD9L*, are associated with immunodeficiency and frequent infections. For more information about cancer genetics [risk assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and [genetic counseling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), see [Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling](/publications/pdq/information-summaries/genetics/risk-assessment-hp-pdq).

The absence of a family history of HMs does not preclude the need for genetic testing since a [hereditary predisposition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809370&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) to HMs can occur [de novo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783882&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), and some HHMs exhibit only mild to moderate [penetrance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). While an HM diagnosis at a young age can raise suspicion for an HHM, an older age at diagnosis does not eliminate the need for genetic testing, since some HHMs (i.e., *DDX41*) typically present in older patients, with a median age of HM onset in the mid-60s.

### Indications for Genetic Testing

Since [phenotypes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) for HHM have become better defined, indications for germline genetic evaluation have emerged. National and international guideline-issuing bodies (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], International Consensus Classification [ICC], World Health Organization [WHO], and European LeukemiaNet [ELN]) recently updated their guidelines to include recognition of HHM.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)-[4](#cit/section_5.4)]

When evaluating patients, key factors that prompt consideration of germline genetic testing include the following:[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]

- A personal history of a hematologic disease or malignancy.
- A family history of hematologic disease, early-onset cancers, or treatment-related toxicities.
- A personal or family history of malignancy characteristics such as early-onset cancers or an HM with atypical features.

Despite meeting clinical indications for HHM genetic testing, referral for genetic evaluation remains inconsistent.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] Therefore, unbiased, expansive germline genetic [panel testing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763019&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) is emerging as a key diagnostic tool to identify hereditary HM predisposition, thanks to increased availability of multigene panels, accessible genetic counseling, and growing awareness.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)]

### Technical Aspects of Genetic Testing for HHM

Accurate identification of an underlying HHM is achieved by testing [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) from nonhematopoietic germline cells. In individuals without HMs, [germline DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561402&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (for genetic testing) is typically obtained from blood, saliva, or buccal swabs. However, in those with HMs, white blood cells (which are present in the saliva and buccal swabs) harbor [somatic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=781854&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) that can confound interpretation of germline genetic test results.[[7](#cit/section_5.7)] Somatic variants acquired in hematopoietic cells can occur in genes that also cause HHM, like *RUNX1*, *CEBPA*, *GATA2*, and *TP53*, making it difficult to discriminate between germline and somatic variants.[[8](#cit/section_5.8)] Variants detected via somatic testing (i.e., on myeloid malignancy panels) may identify germline pathogenic variants, but these panels are not substitutes for germline genetic testing.

Obtaining true germline DNA is critical when evaluating patients for HHM. Cultured skin fibroblasts (collected via punch biopsies) are the most common germline DNA source for HHM genetic testing.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] Other options, like fingernail clippings or hair follicles, are not widely available. It may take 6 to 8 weeks to receive genetic test results when using these sample types. Therefore, it is important that patients be referred to genetics in a timely manner to inform therapeutic decision making and the donor selection process for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). For individuals who have received allogeneic HSCT, their blood and buccal swab samples contain their donor’s DNA.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)] Therefore, cultured fibroblasts may be needed to determine the germline statuses of these individuals.

Standard methodological approaches for HHM genetic testing include the following:

- Multigene [next-generation sequencing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763024&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (NGS) panels: These panels use NGS to analyze a set of genes that are associated with HHM and HHM-related disorders.
- [Single nucleotide polymorphism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458046&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (SNP) microarray analysis: SNP arrays detect [copy number variations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=600383&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and regions with [loss of heterozygosity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=464169&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (LOH), which are often indicative of [clonal hematopoiesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=803518&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and can be associated with a specific HHM.
- [Whole exome sequencing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=740459&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (WES) and [whole genome sequencing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=740456&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (WGS): WES and WGS provide sequencing of the entire protein-coding region (exome) or full genome, respectively. These approaches allow analysis of virtual gene panels (different panels can be applied to the full sequencing data to analyze specific subsets of genes) from full sequencing data and unbiased analysis across all genes. WES and WGS can also enable detection of LOH through bioinformatic algorithms.

The optimal genetic testing approach depends on the patient's clinical presentation and local genetic testing resources. WES and WGS are emerging as a standards since they can reanalyze data over time as new genetic associations are reported. Consultations with genetic counselors help guide the patient’s genetic testing strategy.

## Genes Associated with Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies

All described [inherited predispositions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) to hematologic malignancies follow well-defined Mendelian inheritance patterns: [autosomal dominant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793860&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), [autosomal recessive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), and [X-linked](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339348&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). [Penetrance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) varies depending on the hereditary hematologic malignancy (HHM).

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the genetics of hereditary hematologic malignancies. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Cancer Genetics Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/genetics "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/genetics"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

The lead reviewers for Genetics of Hereditary Hematologic Malignancies are:

- Julia Cooper, MS, CGC (Ohio State University)
- Courtney DiNardo, MD, MSC (University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center)
- Marcin Wlodarski, MD, PhD (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)

Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us"). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Cancer Genetics Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/genetics) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
