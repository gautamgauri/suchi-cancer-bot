# Childhood Cervical and Vaginal Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Risk Factors and Clinical Presentation

Adenocarcinoma of the cervix and vagina is rare in childhood and adolescence.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[2](#cit/section_1.2)] Two-thirds of cases in previous reports have been associated with exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) *in utero*.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] However, the few case reports of vaginal cancer in children in the last decade have not been associated with exposure to DES *in utero*.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)]

The median age at presentation is 15 years, with a range of 7 months to 18 years. Most patients present with vaginal bleeding. Adults with adenocarcinoma of the cervix or vagina present with stage I or stage II disease 90% of the time.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] In children and adolescents, there is a high incidence of stage III and stage IV disease (24%). This difference may be explained by the practice of routine pelvic examinations in adults and the hesitancy to perform them in children.

## Stage Information for Cervical and Vaginal Cancer

The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) system is used to stage cervical and vaginal cancer. For more information, see the [Staging Information for Cervical Cancer](/types/cervical/hp/cervical-treatment-pdq#_11) section in Cervical Cancer Treatment and the [Staging Information for Vaginal Cancer](/types/vaginal/hp/vaginal-treatment-pdq#_7) section in Vaginal Cancer Treatment.

## Treatment and Outcome of Childhood Cervical and Vaginal Cancer

Treatment options for childhood carcinoma of the cervix and vagina include the following:

1. Surgery.
2. Radiation therapy, for residual microscopic disease or lymphatic metastases.

The treatment of choice is surgical resection,[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] followed by radiation therapy for residual microscopic disease or lymphatic metastases. The role of chemotherapy in management is unknown. However, drugs commonly given for the treatment of gynecological malignancies, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, have been used.[[2](#cit/section_3.2),[3](#cit/section_3.3)]

In a retrospective report, 37 patients with cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma or cervical mesonephric adenocarcinoma were treated with various modalities (surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy). The 3-year event-free survival rate was 71% (± 11%) for patients with all stages of tumors, 82% (± 11%) for patients with stage I and stage II tumors, and 57% (± 22%) for patients with stage III and stage IV tumors.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)]

## Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Childhood Cervical and Vaginal Cancer

Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search"). For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the [ClinicalTrials.gov website](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/").

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Ophthalmologists.
- Rehabilitation
specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families. Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)-[5](#cit/section_5.5)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] The U.S. [Rare Diseases Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf "https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf") defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.

The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[8](#cit/section_5.8)] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:

- A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)]
- The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)]

Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as [Cervical Cancer Treatment](/types/cervical/hp/cervical-treatment-pdq) and [Vaginal Cancer Treatment](/types/vaginal/hp/vaginal-treatment-pdq).
