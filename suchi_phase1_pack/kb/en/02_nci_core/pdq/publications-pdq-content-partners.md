# PDQ® Content Partners - NCI

# PDQ® Content Partners

As a public service that is fully funded by the U.S. government, PDQ health professional cancer information summaries are freely available to U.S. and global audiences through publication on NCI’s website. Most of the health professional summaries are also available in a patient-focused format.

In addition to publishing the PDQ summaries on the NCI website, PDQ has many content partners in the U.S. and around the world that include academic and research institutions, nonprofit institutions, and commercial web and print publishers.

## Types of Partners

### Content Distribution Partners

These partners use NCI-produced content in their websites and information products and may syndicate it to their partners and customers, further extending its dissemination. The summaries are made available to these partners through the [NCI content syndication program](/syndication). In addition to the organizations listed below, there are 120+ organizations who display the NCI Dictionary of Cancer terms on their website.
