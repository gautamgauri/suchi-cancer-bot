# Agnostic Cancer Therapies (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Introduction

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both gene- and immune-targeted drugs for tissue-agnostic, genomic biomarker–based indications in patients with lethal solid tumors and blood cancers. High response rates were the basis for these approvals.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

Precision medicine has rapidly changed the oncology field. Next-generation sequencing can identify patients with specific gene alterations or immune markers for which there are targeted therapies. Biomarker-based treatments are increasingly emerging, and the FDA has approved the following tissue-agnostic therapies:[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

- Pembrolizumab.
- Dostarlimab.
- Entrectinib.
- Larotrectinib.
- Repotrectinib.
- Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib.
- Selpercatinib.
- Pemigatinib.
- Trastuzumab deruxtecan.

Precision medicine is constantly evolving, and improved diagnostic tools allow for more comprehensive genomic definition of the tumor. Tissue-agnostic targeted therapies are a promising treatment strategy tailored to the specific tumor genomic profile, leading to improved patient survival outcomes.

The list of drugs approved for tumors with genomic alterations will likely expand as understanding of the science driving these cancers continues to advance. As oncology drug development continues to move rapidly, the location where the cancer originated will become less critical.

Companion tests can determine the presence of specific genomic alterations or immune markers. These tests may have been approved by the FDA as part of the agnostic drug approval. Most insurance companies have not required these specific tests before covering the prescribed medications.

## Microsatellite Instability–High or Mismatch Repair–Deficient Solid Tumors

### Pembrolizumab

**Indication.** Pembrolizumab is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability–high (MSI-H)/microsatellite unstable or mismatch repair–deficient (dMMR) solid tumors whose disease progressed after prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The MSI-H phenotype is associated with germline defects in the *MLH1*, *MSH2*, *MSH6*, and *PMS2* genes and is the primary phenotype observed in tumors from patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome. Patients can also have the MSI-H phenotype because one of these genes was silenced via DNA methylation. Molecular genetic tests look for microsatellite instability in the tumor tissue, and immunohistochemistry tests for the loss of mismatch repair proteins. For more information, see the [Immunotherapy](/types/colorectal/hp/colon-treatment-pdq#_645) section in Colon Cancer Treatment.

**Evidence.** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was based on data from the following five uncontrolled, multicohort, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials that included 149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers:[[1](#cit/section_2.1)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- [KEYNOTE-016](/clinicaltrials/NCT01876511) (NCT01876511) (median follow-up, 5.3 months).[[2](#cit/section_2.2)]
- [KEYNOTE-164](/clinicaltrials/NCT02460198) (NCT02460198) (median follow-up, 31.3 months).[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]
- [KEYNOTE-012](/clinicaltrials/NCT01848834) (NCT01848834) (median follow-up, 9 months).[[4](#cit/section_2.4)]
- [KEYNOTE-028](/clinicaltrials/NCT02054806) (NCT02054806) (median follow-up, 9.8 months).[[5](#cit/section_2.5)]
- [KEYNOTE-158](/clinicaltrials/NCT02628067) (NCT02628067) (median follow-up, 13.4 months).[[6](#cit/section_2.6)]

These trials included 90 patients with colorectal cancer and 59 patients with other cancers who were diagnosed with one of 14 other cancer types. Patients received either 200 mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every 2 weeks.

**Efficacy.** The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate, assessed by blinded independent central radiologist review according to RECIST 1.1, and response duration. The pooled objective response rate was 39.6%. A total of 11 patients (7.4%) had a complete response and 48 patients (32.2%) had a partial response. The objective response rate was 36% in patients with colorectal cancer, and 46% in patients with other cancers (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%–59%).[[7](#cit/section_2.7),[8](#cit/section_2.8)] Responses lasted 6 months or longer for 78% of patients who responded to pembrolizumab.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

**Identification of biomarker.** For most patients (135 of 149), tumor status was prospectively determined using local laboratory-developed, investigational polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (for MSI-H) or immunohistochemistry (for dMMR).[[9](#cit/section_2.9)] For 14 of the 149 patients, MSI-H status was determined in a retrospective assessment of tumor samples from 415 patients using a central laboratory-developed PCR test.

### Dostarlimab

**Indication.** Dostarlimab is indicated for adult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, whose disease progressed during or after prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication is not approved in the pediatric population.

**Evidence.** [GARNET](/clinicaltrials/NCT02715284) (NCT02715284) was a nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label, multicohort trial that evaluated the efficacy of dostarlimab.[[10](#cit/section_2.10)] The expansion cohorts were as follows:[[11](#cit/section_2.11)-[14](#cit/section_2.14)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

1. dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancers.
2. Mismatch repair–proficient or microsatellite stable endometrial cancers.
3. Non-small cell lung cancers.
4. Non-endometrial dMMR/MSI-H and *POLE*-mutated cancers.
5. High-grade serous, endometrioid, or clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer without *BRCA* variants.

**Efficacy.** The efficacy population consisted of 209 patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors whose disease progressed after systemic therapy and who had no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The objective response rate was 41.6% (95% CI, 34.9%–48.6%), with a 9.1% complete response rate and a 32.5% partial response rate. The median follow-up was 27.7 months.[[10](#cit/section_2.10)]

**Identification of biomarker.** The VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel is a companion diagnostic device to select patients with dMMR solid tumors for treatment with dostarlimab.

## Tumor Mutational Burden–High (≥10 Mutations/Megabase) Solid Tumors

### Pembrolizumab

**Indication.** Pembrolizumab is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic tumor mutational burden–high (TMB-H) solid tumors, whose disease progressed after prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. TMB-H is defined as ≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb), as determined by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved test.

**Evidence.** FDA approval was based on a retrospective analysis of 10 cohorts of patients with various previously treated unresectable or metastatic TMB-H solid tumors enrolled in [KEYNOTE-158](/clinicaltrials/NCT02628067) (NCT02628067), a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label trial. Patients received 200 mg of pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

**Efficacy.** A total of 102 patients (13%) had TMB-H tumors (defined as TMB ≥10 mut/Mb). The objective response rate for these patients was 29% (95% confidence interval, 21%–39%), with a 4% complete response rate and 25% partial response rate.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The median follow-up was 13.4 months.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

**Identification of biomarker.** The FoundationOne CDx assay is a companion diagnostic test for pembrolizumab.

## NTRK Gene Fusion–Positive Solid Tumors

### Entrectinib

**Indication.** Entrectinib is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors and an *NTRK* gene fusion without a known acquired resistance variant; with disease that is metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity; and who have disease progression after treatment or have no satisfactory standard therapy.

**Evidence.** Five multicenter single-arm clinical trials evaluated the efficacy of entrectinib in patients with *NTRK*-positive tumors. Three of these trials evaluated a total of 54 adult patients who received entrectinib at various doses and schedules. Two of these trials evaluated a total of 33 pediatric patients.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- [ALKA-372-001](/clinicaltrials/NCT02097810); adult patients.
- [STARTRK-1](/clinicaltrials/NCT02097810) (NCT02097810); adult patients.
- [STARTRK-2](/clinicaltrials/NCT02568267) (NCT02568267); adult patients.
- [STARTRK-NG](/clinicaltrials/NCT02650401) (NCT02650401); pediatric patients.
- [TAPISTRY](/clinicaltrials/NCT04589845) (NCT04589845); pediatric patients.

**Efficacy.** Among the 54 adult patients, the overall response rate, as determined by independent review, was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43%–71%). The median follow-up was 15 months.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] Among the 33 pediatric patients, the objective response rate was 70% (95% CI, 51%–84%), and the median duration of response was 25.4 months (95% CI, 14.3–not evaluable). The median follow-up was not defined.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

**Identification of biomarker.** Identification of positive *NTRK* gene fusion status was determined at local laboratories or a central laboratory using nucleic acid-based tests prior to enrollment. Not all *NTRK* variants are gene fusions. Entrectinib has not shown clinical efficacy in patients with nonfusion *NTRK* variants..

### Larotrectinib

**Indication.** Larotrectinib is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors and an *NTRK* gene fusion without a known acquired resistance variant; with disease that is metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity; and who have disease progression after treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

**Evidence.** U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was based on data from three multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trials: [LOXO-TRK-14001](/clinicaltrials/NCT02122913) (NCT02122913), [SCOUT](/clinicaltrials/NCT02637687) (NCT02637687), and [NAVIGATE](/clinicaltrials/NCT02576431) (NCT02576431).[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[4](#cit/section_4.4)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

**Efficacy.** Among 55 patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors harboring an *NTRK* gene fusion enrolled across the three trials, the overall response rate was 75% (95% CI, 61%–85%). The complete response rate was 22%, and the partial response rate was 53%. The median follow-up was 8.3 months.[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

**Identification of biomarker.** *NTRK* gene fusion status was prospectively determined at local laboratories using next-generation sequencing (NGS) or fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH). Not all *NTRK* variants are gene fusions. Entrectinib has not shown clinical efficacy in patients with nonfusion *NTRK* variants..

### Repotrectinib

**Indication.** Repotrectinib is indicated for adult and pediatric patients with an *NTRK* gene fusion and solid tumors that are locally advanced or metastatic for which surgical resection may cause severe morbidity.

**Evidence.** FDA approval was based on data from [TRIDENT-1](/clinicaltrials/NCT03093116) (NCT03093116), a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, multicohort trial.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)-[8](#cit/section_4.8)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

**Efficacy.** In 88 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic *NTRK* gene fusion–positive solid tumors, the overall response rate was 58% (95% CI, 41%–73%) for patients who had not received prior NTRK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (n = 40) and 50% (95% CI, 35%–65%) for patients who had previously received NTRK TKIs (n = 48). The median duration of response was not estimable in the TKI-naïve group and was 9.9 months (95% CI, 7.4–13.0) in the TKI-pretreated group. The median follow-up was 24.0 months.[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8)]

**Identification of biomarker.** *NTRK* gene fusion status was prospectively determined at local laboratories using NGS, Sanger sequencing, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, or FISH. Not all *NTRK* variants are gene fusions. Repotrectinib has not shown clinical efficacy in patients with nonfusion *NTRK* variants.

## BRAF V600E Variant–Positive Solid Tumors

### Dabrafenib in Combination With Trametinib

**Indication.** The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib is indicated for adult and pediatric patients aged 6 years or older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors and a *BRAF* V600E variant. Patients must have progressive disease after prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib is not indicated for patients with colorectal cancer because of known intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition.

**Evidence.** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval was based on data from the following populations:[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Two open-label multiple cohort trials included 131 adult patients: [BRF117019](/clinicaltrials/NCT02034110) (NCT02034110) (median follow-up, 47 weeks), and [NCI-MATCH](/clinicaltrials/NCT02465060) (NCT02465060) protocol H (median follow-up, 23.0 months).[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[3](#cit/section_5.3)]
- One trial included 36 pediatric patients: [CTMT212X2101](/clinicaltrials/NCT02124772) (NCT02124772) (median follow-up, not defined).[[4](#cit/section_5.4)]

The approval was also supported by results from [COMBI-d](/clinicaltrials/NCT01072175) (NCT01072175), [COMBI-v](/clinicaltrials/NCT01597908) (NCT01597908), and [BRF113928](/clinicaltrials/NCT01336634) (NCT01336634).[[6](#cit/section_5.6)]

**Efficacy.** For the 131 adult patients, the overall response rate was 41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%–50%). For the 36 pediatric patients, the overall response rate was 25% (95% CI, 12%–42%).[[5](#cit/section_5.5)]

**Identification of biomarker.** Biomarker status was determined at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or CLIA-equivalent laboratory.

## RET Gene Fusion–Positive Solid Tumors

### Selpercatinib

**Indication.** Selpercatinib is indicated for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a *RET* gene fusion whose disease meets either of the following criteria: disease progressed during or after prior systemic treatment, or disease with no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication is not approved for the pediatric population.

**Evidence.** Forty-one patients with *RET* gene fusion–positive tumors (other than non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] and thyroid cancer) with disease progression during or after prior systemic treatment or who had no satisfactory alternative treatment options were evaluated in the multicenter, open-label, multicohort [LIBRETTO-001](/clinicaltrials/NCT03157128) trial (NCT03157128).[[1](#cit/section_6.1),[2](#cit/section_6.2)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

**Efficacy.** For the 41 evaluable patients with cancers other than NSCLC or thyroid cancer, the objective response rate was 44% (95% confidence interval, 28%–60%). A total of 16 patients had a partial response and 2 patients had a complete response, with a median follow-up of 14.9 months.[[1](#cit/section_6.1),[2](#cit/section_6.2)]

**Identification of biomarker.** Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or CLIA-equivalent locally obtained molecular testing was performed at a certified laboratory, with the use of either next-generation sequencing, fluorescence *in situ* hybridization, or polymerase chain reaction assay.

## FGFR1-Rearranged Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms

### Pemigatinib

**Indication.** Pemigatinib is indicated for adult patients with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with an *FGFR1* rearrangement. This indication is not approved for the pediatric population.

**Evidence.** Twenty-eight patients with relapsed or refractory MLNs with *FGFR1* rearrangement were evaluated in the multicenter open-label, single-arm [FIGHT-203](/clinicaltrials/NCT03011372) trial (NCT03011372). Eligible patients were either not candidates for, or had relapsed disease after, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or a disease-modifying therapy (e.g., chemotherapy).[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[2](#cit/section_7.2)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

**Efficacy.** For all 28 patients (including three patients without evidence of morphologic disease), the complete cytogenetic response rate was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59%–92%). Among the 18 patients with chronic phase disease in the marrow with or without extramedullary disease (EMD), 14 achieved a complete response (78%; 95% CI, 52%–94%). Among the four patients with blast-phase disease in the marrow with or without EMD, two achieved a complete response (duration, 1+ and 94 days). For the three patients with EMD only, one achieved a complete response (duration, 64+ days) with a median follow-up of 25.3 months.[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[2](#cit/section_7.2)]

**Identification of biomarker.** Biomarker identification was performed using local cytogenetics and both local and central fluorescence *in situ* hybridization results.

## Potential Emerging Agnostic Targets Not Yet Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

### Tumor Mutational Burden–High (TMB-H) (≥16 Mutations/Megabase [mut/Mb]) Solid Tumors

#### Atezolizumab

**Target and mechanism.** Atezolizumab blocks the interaction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and CD80 receptors (B7-1Rs).

**Current approvals.** Atezolizumab is approved for non-small cell lung cancer,[[1](#cit/section_9.1)-[5](#cit/section_9.5)] small-cell lung cancer,[[6](#cit/section_9.6)] hepatocellular carcinoma,[[7](#cit/section_9.7)] melanoma,[[8](#cit/section_9.8)] and alveolar soft part sarcoma.[[9](#cit/section_9.9)]

**Supporting study.** Atezolizumab was evaluated in a phase IIa, multibasket, MyPathway study. The preplanned primary end point was objective response rate in patients with TMB-H (≥16 mut/Mb) tumors by FoundationOne TMB testing.[[10](#cit/section_9.10)]

**Study population.** This study included 120 patients with advanced solid tumors with TMB ≥10 mut/Mb by any Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified assay. Among patients with local or central FoundationOne TMB testing results, 42 had TMB ≥16 mut/Mb tumors, comprising the primary efficacy population, and 49 had TMB ≥10 and <16 mut/Mb tumors, of whom 48 were efficacy evaluable.[[10](#cit/section_9.10)]

**Efficacy.** In the primary analysis population of 42 patients with TMB ≥16 mut/Mb tumors, the confirmed objective response rate was 38.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.6%–54.4%) and the disease-control rate (the best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease >4 months) was 61.9% (95% CI, 45.6%–76.4%), with a median follow-up of 9.9 months.[[10](#cit/section_9.10)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
