## General Information

714-X was developed more than 30 years ago in a privately funded laboratory in
Quebec, Canada, where it continues to be produced. The primary component of
714-X is naturally derived [camphor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44001&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is chemically modified by the introduction
of [ammonia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691409&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) chloride moiety. Numerous [trace elements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44573&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have also been found
in batches of 714-X.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

The private laboratory markets 714-X worldwide through its own distribution
company.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] In Canada, this [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is legally available on compassionate grounds
only and must be obtained through a [physician.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390246&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)] Because the production of 714-X is not regulated, there is no
guarantee that rigorous quality control procedures are followed to ensure
manufacturing consistency or product safety. The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) has not approved 714-X for use as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or any other medical condition. In addition, the FDA has placed an import [ban](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_149.html "http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_149.html") on 714-X.

Before researchers can conduct [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) research in the United States, they must file an [Investigational](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44763&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) New Drug (IND) application with the FDA.
The IND application process is confidential, and information about an IND can
be disclosed only by the applicants. No investigators have announced
that they have applied for an IND to study 714-X as a treatment for
cancer.

714-X is usually administered by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) near [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [groin.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46375&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) It can also
be administered [nasally](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44061&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), using a [nebulizer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44063&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Nasal administration is used
for [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment and for the treatment of patients with [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancers. The producers of 714-X do not
recommend [intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or oral
administration. A usual treatment cycle consists of a single daily injection
for 21 days followed by a 2- to 3-day rest period. Between 6 and 12
treatment cycles have been recommended by the producers. The producers of 714-X advise a 50%
reduction in [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [pediatric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46245&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
patients who weigh less than 30 [kg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44576&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (66 lb).[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

It has been suggested that 714-X is more effective if administered early in
the disease process and before [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The
producers claim, however, that 714-X can also be used in conjunction with [conventional treatments](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It
has been further suggested that the use of [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment with
nonconventional therapies such as shark or bovine (i.e., cow) [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (and other [angiogenesis inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46739&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)),
[vitamin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390323&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) B12 supplements, and [vitamin E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supplements be avoided during 714-X
treatment.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

## History

Little documentation exists regarding the development of 714-X and its
mechanism of action. It appears to have been developed in the 1960s on the
basis of earlier studies that used a high-magnification [dark-field microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44021&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called
a somatoscope.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] With dark-field microscopes, researchers are able
to examine living [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in samples of fresh [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) taken from
healthy individuals and individuals with serious diseases, including
[cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The developer of 714-X states that the study of living cells (as opposed to the dead cells examined with a
conventional [light microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44052&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
or an [electron microscope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44025&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov))
led to the theory that [microorganisms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44059&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) distinct from [bacteria](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [viruses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45941&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [fungi](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44571&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exist normally in the blood and play
a role in the development of cancer. These microorganisms, which are called
somatids, are said to exist in multiple forms, some of which appear only in
individuals [affected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460124&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) by [degenerative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44138&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) diseases. The forms associated
with degenerative diseases or cancer reportedly secrete growth [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [toxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substances that disrupt
normal [cellular metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44126&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and damage
the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In this compromised environment, cells that have become
[cancerous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are allowed to [proliferate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44572&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It was also suggested
that cancer cells trap nitrogen, thereby depriving the rest of the body of the
nitrogen needed for normal cellular metabolism. In addition, it was proposed
that cancer cells secrete a toxic substance, cocancerogenic K factor, that
further inhibits the immune system.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

The producers of 714-X state that cancer can be [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and its
development and spread can be predicted, by studying blood samples with the
somatoscope. No evidence has been published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals to support these proposals, and the somatidian theory of cancer
development is not widely accepted.

714-X reportedly works by protecting, stabilizing, and reactivating the
patient’s immune system so that the body can defend itself against cancer cell
growth and [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[3](#cit/section_3.3)] 714-X is said to accomplish this, in part, by helping to increase the
“fluidity” of [lymph](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46305&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] In addition, the
[camphor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44001&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) component of 714-X is purportedly attracted to cancer cells, where the
added nitrogen is released, thus preventing malignant cells from depleting the
nitrogen required by normal cells (including immune system cells) for proper
metabolism and function.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

## Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies

No [laboratory study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the safety and/or effectiveness of 714-X has been
published in scientific literature. A few animal experiments have been
conducted, but the results of these experiments have not been reported in
peer-reviewed scientific journals. The [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) utilized a [lymphosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44115&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumor model](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44091&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in rats and [lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumor models in dogs and cows.
714-X was not found to be effective as an anticancer treatment in these
studies.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

A few laboratory and animal studies have suggested that [camphor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44001&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is able
to enhance the response of the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to [vaccine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) administration and to increase the
[sensitivity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322883&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) of [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[2](#cit/section_4.2)-[6](#cit/section_4.6)] In one series of
studies, investigators used camphor vapors as a [conditioned stimulus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44012&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to
promote an [immune response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45722&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[2](#cit/section_4.2)-[5](#cit/section_4.5)] These studies demonstrated that mice exposed
to camphor vapors at the same time they received an antilymphoma vaccine
showed decreased growth of [transplanted](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46631&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lymphoma cells and increased survival
when they were re-exposed to camphor vapors plus the vaccine or to camphor
vapors alone, in comparison with mice re-exposed to only the vaccine.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[3](#cit/section_4.3)]
These investigators also demonstrated that exposure to camphor vapors led to
an increase in [natural killer
cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44062&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [[4](#cit/section_4.4)] and an increase in tumor-specific [cytotoxic T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[5](#cit/section_4.5)] Another
study reported that [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [adenocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells transplanted
under the skin of mice responded better to local radiation therapy when small
[doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of camphor were administered by [intraperitoneal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) before
the radiation treatment.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)]

Finally, researchers examined nine [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including a
camphor-containing compound, for their ability to inhibit the activity of
estrone sulfatase, an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) involved in the production of estrone, which is a
precursor of the various forms of [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Estrogens are thought to
promote the growth of [hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-dependent [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells. The
camphor-containing compound showed only modest inhibition of estrone sulfatase
activity in human breast cancer cells grown *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)*.[[7](#cit/section_4.7)]

## Summary of the Evidence for 714-X

To assist readers in evaluating the results of human/clinical studies of
integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a scoring system has been devised that allows
studies of individual treatments to be ranked according to the strength of
their evidence (i.e., their level of evidence). Not all studies, however,
are given a level of evidence score. To be eligible, a study must:

- Evaluate
a [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) outcome(s), such as
[tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), improvement in
survival, or carefully measured improvement in [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Be reported in
a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
- Have its [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) findings
published in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made.

Evidence from studies that do not meet these requirements is considered extremely weak. In addition to scoring individual studies, a summary of the evidence is usually made.

Because no study of the use of 714-X in humans has been reported in a
peer-reviewed scientific journal, no level of evidence [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is possible
for this treatment. Therefore, at this time, the use of 714-X as a treatment
for cancer cannot be recommended outside the context of well-designed [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

For additional information about [levels of evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) analysis, refer to [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).
