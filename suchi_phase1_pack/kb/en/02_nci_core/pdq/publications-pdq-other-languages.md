# PDQ® Cancer Information Summaries in Other Languages

The National Cancer Institute, along with several of its trusted content partners, provides translations of selected PDQ cancer Information summaries for health professionals and patients and other NCI patient content in Spanish and Japanese.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) translates most of the PDQ cancer information summaries for health professionals and patients and other NCI content into Spanish.
- ### [Japanese](https://cancerinfo.tri-kobe.org)

The Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation at Kobe (FBRI) translates the PDQ cancer information summaries for patients and health professionals, the patient-focused NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms, and the NCI drug information summaries into Japanese and makes them available through the Cancer Information Japan website. The National Cancer Institute is not responsible for the accuracy of the translations.
