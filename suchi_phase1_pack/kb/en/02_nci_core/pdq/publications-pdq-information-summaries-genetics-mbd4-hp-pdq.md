# MBD4-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Introduction

The association between [germline,](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) [biallelic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *MBD4* loss-of-function variants and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was first described in 2018.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] In this initial report, hallmark mutational features from three patients with biallelic germline *MBD4* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) were described, including an increased somatic variant rate with the accumulation of CG>TG somatic leukemogenic variants in [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies. Additional published reports suggest that biallelic *MBD4* pathogenic variants may be associated with a multicancer predisposition syndrome, called *MBD4*-associated neoplasia syndrome (MANS). In addition to increasing the risk of developing AML, MANS increases the risk of gastrointestinal polyposis (comparable to attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) and may also increase the risk of schwannoma.[[2](#cit/section_1.2),[3](#cit/section_1.3)] There are conflicting data from a limited number of studies on whether [heterozygous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339341&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) germline pathogenic variants in *MBD4* increase the risk of developing uveal melanoma.[[4](#cit/section_1.4),[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

## Genetics and Molecular Biology of MBD4-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

The *MBD4* [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) codes for a [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) glycosylase (similar to MUTYH and NTHL1) that is recruited in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. In mouse studies, MBD4 helped repair methylation damage incurred by spontaneous deamination of 5’-methylcytosine to thymine, which is characterized by mismatched CG>TG.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)] Individuals with [biallelic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *MBD4* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) lack the ability to use MBD4 for BER of GT mismatches. In turn, cancer risk is increased. Resulting cancers also appear to have elevated mutational burden and are enriched for this specific CG>TG signature.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

*MBD4* is located at [chromosome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) 3q21.3. Germline disease-causing *MDB4* variants described in acute myeloid leukemia are loss-of-function homozygous or [compound heterozygous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=766214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) variants. Therefore, MANS has an [autosomal recessive inheritance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) pattern. The types of loss-of-function variants reported include [nonsense variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783965&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (conferring abnormal splicing), [deletions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460141&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), and duplications.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

## Clinical Manifestations of MBD4-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

### Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in *MBD4*-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

Nine patients with this syndrome have been reported in the literature.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[3](#cit/section_3.3)] Based on these reports, individuals with [germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) *MBD4*-associated AML tend to develop early onset disease, with all reported AML cases (four) occurring between 33 and 49 years. A fifth patient was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome at age 37 years. There are not enough cases to estimate [penetrance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). Germline genetic testing for *MBD4*-associated neoplasia syndrome (MANS) may be indicated for patients with AML and the following: 1) increased mutational burden on myeloid neoplasm somatic sequencing, especially when the mutational burden is enriched for CG>GT variants; and/or 2) a personal history of colonic polyposis, schwannomatosis, or uveal melanoma (UVM). Because MANS is [autosomal recessive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), it may arise in individuals who do not have family histories of leukemia or other MANS-associated manifestations.

### Colorectal Polyposis in *MBD4*-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

There are nine reported cases of MANS in the scientific literature.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[3](#cit/section_3.3)] Of these nine individuals, eight underwent colonoscopy at the time these cases were published. Almost all polyps were adenomas, and counts exceeded 20 polyps over multiple colonoscopies. One individual had more than 130 polyps.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Another individual had 75 polyps, leading to colectomy at age 32 years.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Another individual developed colorectal cancer (CRC) at age 40 years.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

One study ran [whole-exome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=740459&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) or [whole-genome sequencing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=740456&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) on 309 individuals who previously underwent genetic testing, which did not find a [pathogenic variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] These individuals had one of the following: 1) multiple colorectal adenomas, or 2) family histories of multiple individuals with CRC. Patients with a [biallelic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) loss of *MBD4* presented with oligopolyposis. Cancers observed in [affected individuals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460124&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) included UVM, CRC, and AML. Most of the adenomas that were found had an accumulation of CG>TG transitions in well-known CRC driver [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) like *APC*, *KRAS*, and *AMER1*.

One differential diagnosis for individuals with a history of early onset leukemia and polyposis is a history of receiving total body radiation as a part of a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These individuals are also at an increased risk for gastrointestinal polyps. A case series reported on five patients (all < 1 yr) who underwent HSCT for leukemia after receiving total-body radiation.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] Every patient developed symptomatic gastrointestinal polyps 0.75 to 5.75 years after HSCT.

### Uveal Melanoma in *MBD4*-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

It is unclear if MANS is associated with an increased risk for UVM. UVM was reported in two individuals with MANS: one individual developed two primary UVMs at age 38 years and age 45 years, and one individual developed UVM at age 53 years.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Interestingly, both individuals with UVM and MANS carried at least one c.939dup *MBD4* variant.

### Other Manifestations in *MBD4*-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

There are two reports of schwannomas in individuals with MANS. One individual had a vestibular schwannoma at age 34 years.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Another individual had two schwannomas at age 50 years and also had a meningioma at age 41 years.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

## Management and Prognosis for MBD4-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines provide management recommendations for individuals with molecularly confirmed *MBD4*-associated neoplasia syndrome (MANS):[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

- NCCN recommends colonoscopy beginning at age 18 to 20 years or at the time of diagnosis to screen for colorectal polyps. Colonoscopy can be repeated every 2 to 3 years.
- NCCN recommends annual ophthalmologic exam when the individual is diagnosed with MANS.
- NCCN recommends complete blood count (CBC) when the individual is diagnosed with MANS, but it does not comment on the frequency of CBC afterwards. There is no consensus on the ideal frequency for CBC in patients with MANS.

Individualized treatment recommendations do not yet exist for individuals with MANS.
