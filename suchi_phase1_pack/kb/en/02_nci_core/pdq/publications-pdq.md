# PDQ® Cancer Information - NCI

# PDQ® Cancer Information for Health Professionals

The PDQ health professional cancer information summaries are part of the **comprehensive, evidence-based, up-to-date** cancer content made available as a public service of the NCI. They are intended to

- **improve the overall quality of cancer care** by informing and educating health professionals about the current published evidence related to individual cancer-related topics and
- **support informed decision making between clinicians and patients.**

Selected PDQ cancer information is translated into Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese by NCI and trusted content partners. Learn more about [PDQ® in Other Languages](/publications/pdq/other-languages).
