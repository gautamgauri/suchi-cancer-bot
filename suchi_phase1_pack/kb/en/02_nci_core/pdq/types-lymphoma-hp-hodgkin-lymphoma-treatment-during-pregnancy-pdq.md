## General Information About Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment During Pregnancy

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) primarily affects young women, some of whom may be pregnant. When treating a pregnant woman, an oncologist will provide therapy that minimizes risk to the fetus. Treatment choice must be individualized,
taking the following into consideration:

- The mother’s wishes.
- The severity and aggressiveness of the
HL.
- The trimester of the pregnancy.

## Stage Information for Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy

To avoid exposing a pregnant woman to ionizing
radiation, magnetic resonance imaging
is the preferred method for staging evaluation.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] The presenting stage, clinical behavior, prognosis, and histological subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in pregnant women do not differ from those in nonpregnant women during their childbearing years.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)] For more information, see the [Stage Information for HL](/types/lymphoma/hp/adult-hodgkin-treatment-pdq#_12) section in Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment.

## Treatment Options for Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy

Treatment options for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) during pregnancy include:

1. Watchful waiting.
2. Radiation therapy.
3. Chemotherapy.

In one study, the 20-year survival rate of pregnant women with HL did not differ from the 20-year survival rate of nonpregnant women who were matched for similar stage of disease, age at diagnosis, and calendar year of treatment.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

The long-term effects on children after chemotherapy exposure in utero are unknown.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[5](#cit/section_3.5)]

Based on anecdotal series, there is no evidence that a pregnancy after completion of therapy increases the relapse rate for patients in remission.[[6](#cit/section_3.6),[7](#cit/section_3.7)]

### Therapy During the First Trimester

HL that is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy does not constitute an absolute indication for therapeutic abortion. Treatment options for each patient must take into account disease stage, rapidity of growth of the lymphoma, and the patient's wishes.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)]

#### Watchful waiting

If the HL presents in
early stage above the diaphragm and is growing slowly, patients can
be observed carefully, with plans to induce delivery early and proceed with
definitive therapy.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)]

#### Radiation therapy

Alternatively, these patients can receive radiation
therapy with proper shielding.[[10](#cit/section_3.10)-[13](#cit/section_3.13)] Investigators at the MD Anderson Cancer Center reported no
congenital abnormalities in 16 babies delivered after the mothers had received
supradiaphragmatic radiation while the uterus was shielded with five half-value
layers of lead.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)] Because of theoretical risks of the fetus developing future malignancies from even minimal scattered radiation doses outside the radiation field, postponing radiation therapy—if possible, until after delivery—should be considered.[[15](#cit/section_3.15)]

#### Chemotherapy

Evidence (chemotherapy during the first trimester):

1. Chemotherapy that is administered during the first trimester has been
associated with congenital abnormalities in as many as 33% of infants.[[2](#cit/section_3.2),[16](#cit/section_3.16)]
Consequently, some
women may opt to continue the pregnancy and agree to radiation therapy or
chemotherapy if immediate treatment is required after the first trimester.
2. A multicenter retrospective analysis of 40 patients described pregnancy termination in 3 patients, deferral of therapy to the postpartum period in 13 patients (median 30-week gestation), and antenatal therapy given to the remaining 24 patients (median 21-week gestation, all done after the first trimester).[[17](#cit/section_3.17)]

- With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 85%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 97%, often with the use of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine).[[17](#cit/section_3.17)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
3. A retrospective analysis of 39 patients from the MD Anderson Cancer Center described pregnancy termination in 3 patients, deferral of therapy to the postpartum period in 12 patients, and antenatal therapy given to 24 patients.[[18](#cit/section_3.18)]

- Two women had a miscarriage after receiving doxorubicin-based chemotherapy during the first trimester.
- With a median follow-up of 68 months from diagnosis, the 5-year PFS rate was 75%, and the OS rate was 82%. These rates did not differ between the antenatal and postpartum timing of therapy.[[18](#cit/section_3.18)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### Therapy Later in Pregnancy

#### Watchful waiting

In the second half of pregnancy, patients can be observed carefully,
and therapy can be postponed until induction of delivery at 32 to 36 weeks.[[4](#cit/section_3.4),[5](#cit/section_3.5),[16](#cit/section_3.16)]

#### Radiation therapy

As an
alternative, a short course of radiation therapy can be used before delivery in
cases of respiratory compromise caused by a rapidly enlarging mediastinal mass.

#### Chemotherapy

If
chemotherapy is mandatory before delivery—such as for patients with
symptomatic advanced-stage disease—vinblastine alone, given intravenously at 6 mg/m² every 2 weeks until induction of delivery, may
be considered because it has not been associated with fetal abnormalities in the
second half of pregnancy.[[4](#cit/section_3.4),[5](#cit/section_3.5)] Combination chemotherapy with ABVD appears to be safe in the second half of pregnancy.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] If chemotherapy is required after the first trimester, many clinicians prefer the combination of drugs over single-agent drugs or radiation therapy. Steroids are used both for their
antitumor effect and for hastening fetal pulmonary maturity.

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria.

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

The lead reviewer for Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment During Pregnancy is:

- Eric J. Seifter, MD (Johns Hopkins University)

Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us"). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/treatment) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
