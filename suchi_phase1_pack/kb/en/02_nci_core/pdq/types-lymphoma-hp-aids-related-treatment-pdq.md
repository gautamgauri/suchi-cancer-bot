### Background and Definitions

AIDS was first described in 1981, and
the first definitions included certain opportunistic infections, Kaposi
sarcoma, and central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas.
In 1984, a multicenter
study described the clinical spectrum of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in the
populations at risk of AIDS.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] The incidence of NHL has increased in a course almost parallel
to that of the AIDS epidemic and accounts for 2% to 3% of newly diagnosed AIDS
cases.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid-1990s, the incidence of lymphomas has decreased, and outcomes have improved.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] Higher CD4-positive T-lymphocyte (CD4) counts in the HAART era have been associated with a shift in histological diagnoses. The shift is away from primary effusion lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma, which occur with the lowest CD4 counts, and toward histologies that occur at higher CD4 counts, such as Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).[[4](#cit/section_1.4)-[6](#cit/section_1.6)] In contrast to less-frequent incidences of all the lymphoproliferative disorders in the HAART era, the incidence rate of anal cancer has not changed.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]

### Histology

Pathologically, AIDS-related lymphomas comprise a narrow spectrum of
histological types consisting almost exclusively of B-cell tumors of aggressive
type. These include:

- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (including B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma).
- Small
noncleaved lymphoma, either Burkitt or Burkitt-like.

The HIV-associated lymphomas
can be categorized as:

- Aggressive B-cell lymphoma (see above).
- Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL).
- Primary effusion lymphoma.
- Plasmablastic multicentric Castleman disease.
- HL.

#### HIV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma

Multiple reviews of HL occurring in patients
at risk of AIDS have been done;[[8](#cit/section_1.8),[9](#cit/section_1.9)] however, HL is still
not part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of AIDS because no clear
demonstration of its increased incidence in conjunction with HIV has been shown, as is the
case for aggressive NHL. The CDC, in conjunction with the
San Francisco Department of Public Health, has reported a cohort study in which
HIV-infected men had an excess risk that was attributable to the HIV infection
in 19.3 cases of HL per 100,000 person-years and 224.9 cases of
NHL per 100,000 person-years. Although this report found an excess incidence
of HL in HIV-infected homosexual men, additional epidemiologic studies will be needed before the CDC will reconsider
HL as an HIV-associated malignancy.[[10](#cit/section_1.10)]

HIV-associated HL presents in an aggressive fashion, often with
extranodal or bone marrow involvement.[[8](#cit/section_1.8),[9](#cit/section_1.9),[11](#cit/section_1.11)] A distinctive feature of
HIV-associated HL is the lesser frequency of mediastinal
adenopathy compared with non–HIV-associated HL. Most patients in
these series had either mixed cellularity or lymphocyte-depleted HL, expression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated proteins in Reed-Sternberg cells, B symptoms, and a median CD4 lymphocyte count of 300/dL or
lower.[[12](#cit/section_1.12)]
In a retrospective multicenter review of 62 patients, those receiving HAART with chemotherapy had a 74% 2-year overall survival (OS) rate versus a 30% OS rate for those not receiving HAART (*P* < .001).[[13](#cit/section_1.13)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Among 201 patients with classical HL and HIV positivity, the 2- to 5-year OS rate of 88% to 90% after treatment with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), or similar regimens, and HAART, was not significantly different from the OS rate of HIV-negative patients with newly diagnosed HL in two uncontrolled comparisons.[[14](#cit/section_1.14),[15](#cit/section_1.15)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] These studies confirm that patients with HL who were treated with standard regimens and HAART have outcomes that are similar to those of the uninfected population.[[16](#cit/section_1.16)] Furthermore, immune function recovers over the course of 6 to 9 months after completion of chemotherapy.[[15](#cit/section_1.15)]

#### Primary effusion lymphoma

Primary effusion lymphoma has been associated with Kaposi
sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpes virus type 8 (HHV8).[[17](#cit/section_1.17),[18](#cit/section_1.18)]
Primary effusion lymphoma presents as a liquid phase spreading along serous membranes in the absence of masses or adenopathy.[[17](#cit/section_1.17)] In addition to HHV8, many cases are also associated with EBV. Extension of lymphoma from the effusion to underlying tissue may occur. A series of 20 patients, including 19 treated with modified infusional etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide and prednisone (modEPOCH), had a 3-year cancer-specific survival rate of 47% and a median OS of 22 months.[[19](#cit/section_1.19)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

#### Multicentric Castleman disease

The plasmablastic type of multicentric Castleman disease is also associated with a coinfection of KSHV/HHV8 and HIV.[[20](#cit/section_1.20)] Patients typically present with fever, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Patients may progress to primary effusion lymphoma or to plasmablastic or anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Anecdotal responses to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab alone (along with HAART), have been reported.[[21](#cit/section_1.21)-[24](#cit/section_1.24)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] For a prospective cohort of 84 patients treated with rituximab for HIV and HHV8 multicentric Castleman disease, the 5-year rate of relapse-free survival was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72%–92%), and all patients responded again to rituximab at relapse.[[24](#cit/section_1.24)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### Incidence and Prevention

An international database of 48,000 HIV-seropositive individuals from the
United States, Europe, and Australia found a 42% decline in the incidence of
NHLs from 1997 to 1999 compared with the same incidences in 1992 to 1996, both for
PCNSL and for systemic lymphoma.[[25](#cit/section_1.25)] The introduction of HAART is the proposed explanation for this decline.[[26](#cit/section_1.26)] The diagnosis of AIDS precedes the onset of
NHL in approximately 50% of the patients; however, in the other half of the patients, the
diagnosis of AIDS is made at the time of the diagnosis of NHL and HIV positivity.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] The geographic distribution of these lymphomas
is also similar to the geographic spread of AIDS. Unlike KS,
which has a predilection for homosexual men and appears to be on the decline in
incidence, all risk groups appear to have an excess number of NHLs; these risk groups include intravenous drug users and children of
HIV-positive individuals.

### Clinical Presentation

In general, the clinical setting and response to treatment of patients with
AIDS-related lymphoma is very different from that of the non-HIV patients with
lymphoma. The HIV-infected individual with aggressive lymphoma usually
presents with advanced-stage disease that is frequently extranodal.[[27](#cit/section_1.27)]

Common extranodal sites include:

- Bone marrow.
- Liver.
- Meninges.
- Gastrointestinal tract.

Very unusual sites are also characteristic and include:

- Anus.
- Heart.
- Bile duct.
- Gingiva.
- Muscles.

The clinical course is
more aggressive, and the disease is both more extensive and less responsive to
chemotherapy. Immunodeficiency and cytopenias, common in these patients at the
time of initial presentation, are exacerbated by the administration of
chemotherapy. Treatment of the malignancy increases the risk of
opportunistic infections, which further compromise the delivery of
adequate treatment.

### Prognosis and Survival

Prognoses of patients with AIDS-related lymphoma have been associated with:[[28](#cit/section_1.28)]

- Stage (i.e., extent of disease, extranodal involvement, lactate dehydrogenase level, and bone marrow involvement).
- Age.
- Severity of the underlying immunodeficiency (measured by CD4 lymphocyte count
in peripheral blood).
- Performance status.
- Prior AIDS diagnosis (i.e., history of opportunistic infection or KS).

Patients with AIDS-related
PCNSL appear to have more severe underlying HIV-related disease
than do patients with systemic lymphoma. In one report, this severity was
evidenced by patients with PCNSL who had a higher incidence of
previously diagnosed AIDS (73% vs. 37%), lower median number of CD4 lymphocytes
(30/dL vs. 189/dL), and a worse median survival time (2.5 months vs. 6.0
months).[[29](#cit/section_1.29)] This report also showed that patients with poor risk factors—defined as Karnofsky Performance Status score lower than 70%, history of previously diagnosed AIDS, and bone marrow involvement—had a median survival time of 4.0
months compared with patients in a good prognosis group who had none of these risk factors,
and who had a median survival time of 11.3 months.

In another report (NIAID-ACTG-142), prognostic
factors were evaluated in a group of 192 patients with newly diagnosed
AIDS-related lymphoma who were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose
methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
dexamethasone (m-BACOD) or standard-dose m-BACOD with granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor.[[30](#cit/section_1.30)] No differences existed between these two
treatments in terms of efficacy for disease-free survival, median survival, or
risk ratio for death.[[30](#cit/section_1.30)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] On multivariate analysis,
factors associated with decreased survival included age older than 35 years,
history of intravenous drug use, stage III or stage IV disease, and CD4 counts lower than 100 cells/mm3. The
International Prognostic Index may also be predictive for survival.[[31](#cit/section_1.31)-[33](#cit/section_1.33)]
In a multicenter cohort study of 203 patients, in a multivariable Cox model, response to HAART was independently associated with prolonged survival (relative hazard, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.62).[[34](#cit/section_1.34)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Cellular Classification of AIDS-Related Lymphoma

Pathologically, AIDS-related lymphomas comprise a narrow spectrum of
histological types consisting almost exclusively of B-cell tumors of aggressive
type. These include:

- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma).
- Small
noncleaved lymphoma, either Burkitt or Burkitt-like.

AIDS-related lymphomas, though usually of B-cell origin as demonstrated by
immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement studies, have also been shown to
be oligoclonal, polyclonal, and monoclonal in origin. Although HIV
does not appear to have a direct etiologic role, HIV infection does lead to an
altered immunologic milieu. HIV generally infects T lymphocytes with the loss of
regulation function that leads to hypergammaglobulinemia and polyclonal B-cell
hyperplasia. B cells are not the targets of HIV infection. Instead,
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is thought to be at least a cofactor in the etiology
of some of these lymphomas. The EBV genome has been detected in most patients with AIDS-related lymphomas; molecular analysis suggests
that the cells were infected before clonal proliferation began.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] The rare primary effusion lymphoma consistently
harbors human herpes virus type 8 and frequently contains EBV.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)] HIV-related T-cell
lymphomas have also been identified and appear to be associated with EBV
infection.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

## Stage Information for AIDS-Related Lymphoma

Although stage is important in selecting the treatment of patients with
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who do not have AIDS, most patients with AIDS-related lymphomas have far-advanced
disease.

### Staging Subclassification System

#### Lugano classification

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has adopted the Lugano classification to evaluate and stage lymphoma.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The Lugano classification system replaces the Ann Arbor classification system, which was adopted in 1971 at the Ann Arbor Conference,[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] with some modifications 18 years later from the Cotswolds meeting.[[3](#cit/section_3.3),[4](#cit/section_3.4)]

Table 1. Lugano Classification for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomaa

| Stage | Stage Description | Illustration |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; CT = computed tomography; DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; NHL = non-Hodgkin lymphoma. | | |
| aHodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. In: Amin MB, Edge SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.: *AJCC Cancer Staging Manual*. 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 937–58. | | |
| bStage II bulky may be considered either early or advanced stage based on lymphoma histology and prognostic factors. | | |
| cThe definition of disease bulk varies according to lymphoma histology. In the Lugano classification, bulk ln Hodgkin lymphoma is defined as a mass greater than one-third of the thoracic diameter on CT of the chest or a mass >10 cm. For NHL, the recommended definitions of bulk vary by lymphoma histology. In follicular lymphoma, 6 cm has been suggested based on the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 and its validation. In DLBCL, cutoffs ranging from 5 cm to 10 cm have been used, although 10 cm is recommended. | | |
| *Limited stage* | | |
| I | Involvement of a single lymphatic site (i.e., nodal region, Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen). | [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614643.jpg)Stage I adult lymphoma; drawing shows cancer in one lymph node group and in the spleen. Also shown are the Waldeyer’s ring and the thymus. An inset shows a lymph node with a lymph vessel, an artery, and a vein. Cancer cells are shown in the lymph node. |
| IE | Single extralymphatic site in the absence of nodal involvement (rare in Hodgkin lymphoma). |  |
| II | Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. | [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614648.jpg)Stage II adult lymphoma; drawing shows cancer in two lymph node groups above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm. An inset shows a lymph node with a lymph vessel, an artery, and a vein. Cancer cells are shown in the lymph node. |
| IIE | Contiguous extralymphatic extension from a nodal site with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. | [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614650.jpg)Stage IIE adult lymphoma; drawing shows cancer that has spread from a group of lymph nodes to a nearby area. Also shown is a lung and the diaphragm. An inset shows a lymph node with a lymph vessel, an artery, and a vein. Cancer cells are shown in the lymph node. |
| II bulkyb | Stage II with disease bulk.c |  |
| *Advanced stage* | | |
| III | Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement. | [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/614684.jpg)Stage III adult lymphoma; drawing shows the right and left sides of the body. The right side of the body shows cancer in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm. The left side of the body shows cancer in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and cancer in the spleen. |
| IV | Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement; or *noncontiguous* extralymphatic organ involvement in conjunction with nodal stage II disease; or *any* extralymphatic organ involvement in nodal stage III disease. Stage IV includes *any* involvement of the CSF, bone marrow, liver, or lungs (other than by direct extension in stage IIE disease). | [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/629626.jpg)Stage IV adult lymphoma; drawing shows four panels: (a) the top left panel shows cancer in the liver; (b) the top right panel shows cancer in the left lung and in two groups of lymph nodes below the diaphragm; (c) the bottom left panel shows cancer in the left lung and in a group of lymph nodes above the diaphragm and below the diaphragm; and (d) the bottom right panel shows cancer in both lungs, the liver, and the bone marrow (pullout). Also shown is primary cancer in the lymph nodes and a pullout of the brain with cerebrospinal fluid (in blue). |
| Note: Hodgkin lymphoma uses A or B designation with stage group. A/B is no longer used in NHL. | | |

Occasionally, specialized staging systems are used. The physician should be
aware of the system used in a specific report.

The E designation is used when extranodal lymphoid malignancies arise in
tissues separate from, but near, the major lymphatic aggregates. Stage IV
refers to disease that is diffusely spread throughout an extranodal site, such
as the liver. If pathological proof of involvement of one or more extralymphatic
sites has been documented, the symbol for the site of involvement, followed by
a plus sign (+), is listed.

Table 2. Notation for Identification of Sites

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N = nodes | H = liver | L = lung | M = marrow |
| S = spleen | P = pleura | O = bone | D = skin |

Current practice assigns a clinical stage (CS) based on the findings of the
clinical evaluation and a pathological stage (PS) based on the findings made as a
result of invasive procedures beyond the initial biopsy.

For example, on percutaneous biopsy, a patient with inguinal adenopathy and a
positive lymphangiogram without systemic symptoms might be found to have
involvement of the liver and bone marrow. The precise stage of such a patient
would be CS IIA, PS IVA(H+)(M+).

A number of other factors that are not included in the above staging system are
important for the staging and prognosis of patients with NHL. These factors
include:

- Age.
- Performance status (PS).
- Tumor size.
- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values.
- The number of extranodal sites.

## Treatment Option Overview for AIDS-Related Lymphoma

The treatment of patients with AIDS-related lymphomas presents the challenge of integrating therapy
appropriate for the stage and histological subset of malignant lymphoma with the
limitations imposed by HIV infection.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] In
addition to antitumor therapy, essential components of an optimal non-Hodgkin
lymphoma treatment strategy include:[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[3](#cit/section_4.3)]

- Highly active antiretroviral therapy.
- Prophylaxis for
opportunistic infections.
- Rapid recognition and treatment of intercurrent
infections.

Patients with HIV positivity and underlying immunodeficiency
have poor bone marrow reserve, which compromises the potential for drug dose
intensity. Intercurrent opportunistic infection is a risk that may
also lead to a decrease in drug delivery. Furthermore, chemotherapy itself
compromises the immune system and increases the likelihood of opportunistic
infection.

## Treatment of AIDS-Related Peripheral/Systemic Lymphoma

The treatment of AIDS-related lymphomas involves overcoming several problems. These are all
aggressive lymphomas, which by definition are diffuse large cell/immunoblastic
lymphoma or small noncleaved cell lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma). These lymphomas frequently involve
the bone marrow and central nervous system (CNS) and, therefore, are usually in an
advanced stage. In addition, the immunodeficiency of AIDS and the leukopenia
that is commonly seen with HIV infection makes the use of immunosuppressive
chemotherapy challenging.

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a marked reduction in opportunistic infections, prolonged survival with HIV infection, and a median overall survival (OS) for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma that is comparable with the outcome in the nonimmunosuppressed population.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[7](#cit/section_5.7)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The use of HAART has also allowed standard-dose and even intensive chemotherapy regimens to be given with reasonable safety to patients with AIDS-related lymphomas, which is comparable with the outcome in patients without HIV.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[10](#cit/section_5.10)]

Several prospective nonrandomized trials and pooled individual data from 19 prospective trials that included 1,546 patients show that the addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy improves the complete response rate, progression-free survival, and OS.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)-[6](#cit/section_5.6)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Several other prospective nonrandomized trials and the pooled individual data from the same 1,546 patients also show that infusional EPOCH (infusional etoposide, infusional vincristine, infusional doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) produced better outcomes than did CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) (hazard ratioOS, 0.33; *P* = .03).[[3](#cit/section_5.3),[6](#cit/section_5.6),[7](#cit/section_5.7)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Concurrent use of HAART with the infusional EPOCH regimen is controversial; one group advocated for HAART after completion of chemotherapy,[[7](#cit/section_5.7)] while others allowed concurrent therapy.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)]

For patients with Burkitt lymphoma, dose-modified regimens such as R-CODOX (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate, cytarabine and rituximab)-M/IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine) or R-EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, and doxorubicin in combination with rituximab) have shown good results with concurrent or sequential HAART.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[11](#cit/section_5.11),[12](#cit/section_5.12)]

Patients at risk of subsequent CNS involvement
include those with bone marrow involvement or those with EBV
identified in the primary tumor or in the cerebrospinal fluid (i.e., by polymerase
chain reaction).[[13](#cit/section_5.13),[14](#cit/section_5.14)] Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually considered for
patients who are at higher risk of CNS involvement.

Highly selected patients with resistant or relapsed lymphoma after first-line chemotherapy and with continued responsiveness to HAART underwent second-line chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous peripheral stem cell transplant. Long-term survivors have been reported anecdotally for these highly selected patients who relapsed.[[15](#cit/section_5.15)-[18](#cit/section_5.18)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Treatment of AIDS-Related Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma

As with other
AIDS-related lymphomas, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive B-cell neoplasm, either
diffuse large B-cell or diffuse immunoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). AIDS-related PCNSL has
been reported to have a 100% association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] These patients usually
have evidence of low CD4-positive T lymphocyte counts, high HIV viral load, severe debilitation, and
focal neurological symptoms such as seizures, changes in mental status, and
paralysis.

Computed tomographic scans show contrast-enhancing mass lesions that may not
always be distinguished from other CNS diseases, such as toxoplasmosis, that
occur in patients with AIDS.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)] Magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium
contrast may be a more useful initial diagnostic tool in differentiating
lymphoma from cerebral toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy. Lymphoma tends to present with large lesions, which are
enhanced by gadolinium. In cerebral toxoplasmosis, ring enhancement is very
common, lesions tend to be smaller, and multiple lesions are seen.[[3](#cit/section_6.3)-[5](#cit/section_6.5)] Use of
positron emission scanning has demonstrated an improved ability to distinguish
PCNSL from toxoplasmosis.[[6](#cit/section_6.6),[7](#cit/section_6.7)] PCNSL
has an increased uptake while toxoplasmosis lesions are metabolically inactive.
Antibodies against toxoplasmosis may also be very useful because most cerebral toxoplasmosis occurs as a consequence of reactivity of a
previous infection. If the immunoglobulin G titer is less than 1:4, the disease is unlikely
to be toxoplasmotic. A lumbar puncture may be useful to detect as many as 23%
of patients with malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Evaluating the CSF for EBV DNA may be a useful lymphoma-specific tool because EBV
is present in all patients with PCNSL. Despite the many evaluations,
however, most patients with PCNSL require a pathological
diagnosis.[[8](#cit/section_6.8)-[10](#cit/section_6.10)] Diagnosis is made by biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy is
attempted only after failure of antibiotics for toxoplasmosis, which will
produce clinical and radiographic improvement within 1 to 3 weeks in patients
with cerebral toxoplasmosis.[[11](#cit/section_6.11)]

Radiation therapy alone has usually been used in this group of patients. With
doses in the range of 35 Gy to 40 Gy, median duration of survival has been only
72 to 119 days.[[2](#cit/section_6.2),[12](#cit/section_6.12),[13](#cit/section_6.13)] Survival is longer in younger patients with better
performance status and the absence of opportunistic infection.[[14](#cit/section_6.14)] In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, a median survival of 18 months has been seen with radiation therapy alone.[[15](#cit/section_6.15)] An anecdotal report using HAART and high-dose methotrexate for patients with AIDS-related PCNSL showed a median survival that had not been reached with a median follow-up of 27 months.[[16](#cit/section_6.16)] Most patients
respond to treatment by showing partial improvement in neurological symptoms.
Autopsies have revealed that these patients die of opportunistic infections as
well as tumor progression. Treatment of these patients is also complicated by
other AIDS-related CNS infections, including subacute AIDS encephalitis,
cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and toxoplasmosis encephalitis. Spontaneous
remissions have been reported after HAART.[[17](#cit/section_6.17)]
