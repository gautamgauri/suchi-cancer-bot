## General Information About Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

[Go to Patient Version](/types/head-and-neck/patient/adult/lip-mouth-treatment-pdq)

### Anatomy

The oral cavity extends from the skin-vermilion junctions of the anterior lips
to the junction of the hard and soft palates above and to the line of
circumvallate papillae below and is divided into the following specific areas:

- Lip.
- Anterior two thirds of tongue.
- Buccal mucosa.
- Floor of mouth.
- Lower gingiva.
- Retromolar trigone.
- Upper gingiva.
- Hard palate.

### Histopathology

The main routes of lymph node drainage are into the first station nodes
(i.e., buccinator, jugulodigastric, submandibular, and submental). Sites close to
the midline often drain bilaterally. Second station nodes include the parotid,
jugular, and the upper and lower posterior cervical nodes.

Precancerous lesions of the oropharynx include leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and mixed erythroleukoplakia.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Leukoplakia, the most common of the three conditions, is defined by the World Health Organization as “a white patch or plaque that cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease.”[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] The diagnosis of leukoplakia is one of exclusion; conditions such as candidiasis, lichen planus, leukoedema, and others must be ruled out before a diagnosis of leukoplakia can be made.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

The prevalence of leukoplakia in the United States is decreasing as a result of reduced tobacco consumption.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] Although erythroplakia is not as common as leukoplakia, it is much more likely to be associated with dysplasia or carcinoma.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[4](#cit/section_1.4)]

### Prognostic Factors

Early cancers (stage I and stage II) of the lip and oral cavity are highly curable
by surgery or radiation therapy. The choice of treatment is dictated by
the anticipated functional and cosmetic results of treatment and by the
availability of a surgeon or radiation
oncologist with the required expertise.[[5](#cit/section_1.5)-[7](#cit/section_1.7)] A positive surgical margin
or a tumor depth of more than 5 mm significantly increases the risk of
local recurrence.[[8](#cit/section_1.8),[9](#cit/section_1.9)] The risk of occult nodal metastases increases based on depth of invasion of the primary tumor. Depth of invasion holds prognostic significance and was included in tumor staging definitions in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging classification.[[10](#cit/section_1.10),[11](#cit/section_1.11)] Extranodal extension in a lymph node is a significant adverse prognostic factor and was incorporated into the 8th edition AJCC staging system.[[12](#cit/section_1.12),[13](#cit/section_1.13)]

Advanced cancers (stage III and stage IV) of the lip and oral cavity represent a
wide spectrum of challenges for the surgeon and radiation oncologist. Most patients with stage III or stage IV tumors are candidates for treatment by a
combination of surgery and radiation therapy. The exception is patients with small T3 lesions and no regional lymph node and no distant
metastases or who have no lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter, for whom
treatment by radiation therapy alone or surgery alone might be appropriate.[[6](#cit/section_1.6)] Furthermore, because local
recurrence and/or distant metastases are common in this group of patients, clinical trials can be considered. Such trials evaluate the potential
role of radiation modifiers or combination chemotherapy combined with surgery
and/or radiation therapy.

### Survival

Patients with head and neck cancers have an increased chance of developing a
second primary tumor of the upper aerodigestive tract.[[14](#cit/section_1.14),[15](#cit/section_1.15)] A study has shown
that daily treatment with moderate doses of isotretinoin
for 1 year can significantly reduce the incidence of
second tumors. However, no survival advantage has been demonstrated, in
part due to recurrence and death from the primary malignancy.
An additional trial showed no benefit of retinyl palmitate or retinyl palmitate plus beta-carotene when compared with isotretinoin alone.[[16](#cit/section_1.16)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

The cure rates of cancers of the lip and oral cavity depend
on the stage and specific site. Most patients present with early cancers of
the lip, which are highly curable by surgery or by radiation therapy with cure
rates of 90% to 100%. Small cancers of the retromolar trigone, hard palate,
and upper gingiva are highly curable by either radiation therapy or surgery
with survival rates of as high as 100%. Local control rates as high as 90% can be
achieved with either radiation therapy or surgery in small cancers of the
anterior tongue, the floor of the mouth, and buccal mucosa.[[17](#cit/section_1.17)]

Moderately advanced and advanced cancers of the lip also can be controlled
effectively by surgery, radiation therapy, or both. The
choice of treatment is generally dictated by the anticipated functional and
cosmetic results of the treatment. Moderately advanced lesions of the
retromolar trigone without evidence of spread to cervical lymph nodes are
usually curable and have shown local control rates as high as 90%. Such lesions of the
hard palate, upper gingiva, and buccal mucosa have a local control rate of up to 80%. In the absence of clinical evidence of spread to cervical lymph nodes,
moderately advanced lesions of the floor of the mouth and anterior tongue are
generally curable, with survival rates of as high as 70% and 65%, respectively.[[17](#cit/section_1.17),[18](#cit/section_1.18)]

## Cellular Classification of Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

Most head and neck cancers are of squamous cell histology and may be preceded
by various precancerous lesions. Minor salivary gland tumors are not uncommon
in these sites. Specimens removed from the lesions may show the carcinomas to
be noninvasive, in which case the term carcinoma *in situ* is applied. An
invasive carcinoma will be well differentiated, moderately
well differentiated, poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated.

Tumor grading is recommended using Broder classification (Tumor Grade [G]):

- G1: well differentiated.
- G2: moderately well differentiated.
- G3: poorly differentiated.
- G4: undifferentiated.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

No statistically significant correlation between degree of differentiation and
the biological behavior of the cancer exists; however, vascular invasion is a
negative prognostic factor.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

Because leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and mixed erythroleukoplakia are exclusively clinical terms that have no specific histopathologic connotations,[[3](#cit/section_2.3)] the term leukoplakia should be used solely as a clinically descriptive term
to mean that the observer sees a white patch that does not rub off, the
significance of which depends on histological findings. Leukoplakia can
range from hyperkeratosis to an early invasive carcinoma, or it may
represent a fungal infection, lichen planus, or other benign oral disease.

## Stage Information for Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

The staging systems for lip and oral cavity cancer are all clinical staging and are based on the best possible
estimate of the extent of disease before treatment. The assessment of the
primary tumor is based on inspection and palpation when possible and by both
indirect mirror examination and direct endoscopy when necessary. The tumor
must be confirmed histologically, and any other pathological data obtained on
biopsy may be included. The appropriate nodal drainage areas are examined by
careful palpation. Information from diagnostic imaging studies may be used in
staging. Magnetic resonance imaging offers an advantage over computed
tomographic scans in the detection and localization of head and neck tumors and
in the distinction of lymph nodes from blood vessels.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] If a patient's disease
relapses, complete restaging must be done to select the appropriate additional
therapy.[[2](#cit/section_3.2),[3](#cit/section_3.3)]

### American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions

The AJCC has designated staging by TNM
(tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define lip and oral cavity cancer. The staging system reflects the whole oral cavity, which includes the mucosa of the lip but not the external (dry) lip.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] The staging described below is used for patients who have not had a lymph node dissection of the neck.

## Treatment Option Overview for Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

The selection of treatment for lip and oral cavity cancer depends on the site and extent of the primary tumor and the status of the
lymph nodes. Some options for treatment of this cancer include:[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

- Surgery
alone.
- Radiation therapy alone.
- A combination of the surgery and radiation therapy.

For lesions of the oral cavity, surgery must adequately encompass all of the
gross as well as the presumed microscopic extent of the disease. If regional
nodes are positive, cervical node dissection is usually done in continuity.
With modern approaches, the surgeon can successfully ablate large posterior
oral cavity tumors and with reconstructive methods can achieve satisfactory
functional results. Prosthodontic rehabilitation is important, particularly in
early-stage cancers, to assure the best quality of life.

Radiation therapy for lip and oral cavity cancers can be given by external-beam
radiation therapy (EBRT) or interstitial implantation alone, but for many sites the use of both
modalities produces better control and functional results. Small superficial
cancers can be very successfully treated by local implantation using any one of
several radioactive sources, by intraoral cone radiation therapy, or by
electrons. Larger lesions are frequently managed using EBRT to include the primary site and regional lymph nodes, even if they are
not clinically involved. Supplementation with interstitial radiation sources
may be necessary to achieve adequate doses to large primary tumors and/or bulky
nodal metastases. A review of published clinical results of radical radiation
therapy for head and neck cancer suggests a significant loss of local control
with prolonged radiation therapy; therefore,
lengthened standard treatment schedules should be avoided whenever
possible.[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[7](#cit/section_4.7)]

Early cancers (stage I and stage II) of the lip, floor of the mouth, and retromolar
trigone are highly curable by surgery or radiation therapy. The choice of
treatment is dictated by the anticipated functional and cosmetic results. Availability of a surgeon or
radiation oncologist with the required expertise for the individual patient is also a factor in treatment choice.

Advanced cancers (stage III
and stage IV) of the lip, floor of the mouth, and retromolar trigone represent a wide
spectrum of challenges for the surgeon and radiation oncologists. Most patients with stage III or stage IV tumors are candidates for treatment with a
combination of surgery and radiation therapy. The exceptions are patients with small T3 lesions and no regional lymph nodes, and no distant
metastases or patients who have no lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter, for whom
treatment by radiation therapy alone or surgery alone might be appropriate. Because local
recurrence and/or distant metastases are common in this group of patients, clinical trials that are evaluating the following should be considered:

- The
potential role of radiation modifiers to improve local control or decrease
morbidity.
- The role of combinations of chemotherapy with surgery and/or radiation
therapy to improve local control and to decrease the frequency of distant
metastases.

Early cancers of the buccal mucosa are equally curable by radiation therapy or
adequate excision. Patient factors and local expertise influence the choice
of treatment. Larger cancers require composite resection with reconstruction
of the defect by pedicle flaps.

Early lesions (T1 and T2) of the anterior tongue may be managed by surgery or
by radiation therapy alone. Both modalities produce 70% to 85% cure rates in
patients with early lesions. Moderate excisions of tongue, even hemiglossectomy, can often
result in little speech disability provided the wound closure is
such that the tongue is not bound down. However, if the resection is more
extensive, problems may include aspiration of liquids and solids, difficulty
swallowing, and speech difficulties. Occasionally, patients with
tumor of the tongue require almost total glossectomy. Large lesions generally
require combined surgical and radiation treatment. The control rates for
larger lesions are about 30% to 40%. According to clinical and radiological
evidence of involvement, cancers of the lower gingiva that are exophytic and
amenable to adequate local excision may be excised to include portions of bone.
More advanced lesions require segmental bone resection, hemimandibulectomy, or
maxillectomy, depending on the extent of the lesion and its location.

Early lesions of the upper gingiva or hard palate without bone involvement can
be treated with equal effectiveness by surgery or radiation therapy alone.
Advanced infiltrative and ulcerating lesions should be treated by a combination
of radiation therapy and surgery. Most primary cancers of the hard palate are
of minor salivary gland origin. Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the hard
palate is uncommon, and these tumors generally represent invasion of squamous
cell carcinoma arising on the upper gingiva, which is much more common. Management of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper gingiva and hard palate is
usually considered together. Surgical treatment of cancer of the hard palate
usually requires excision of underlying bone producing an opening into the
antrum. This defect can be filled and covered with a dental prosthesis, which is a
maneuver that restores satisfactory swallowing and speech.

Patients who smoke while receiving radiation therapy appear to have lower response
rates and shorter survival durations than those who do not;[[8](#cit/section_4.8)] therefore,
patients should be counseled to stop smoking before beginning radiation
therapy. Dental status evaluation should be performed prior to therapy to
prevent late sequelae.

### Fluorouracil Dosing

The *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[9](#cit/section_4.9),[10](#cit/section_4.10)] Patients with the *DPYD\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)-[11](#cit/section_4.11)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)-[14](#cit/section_4.14)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[15](#cit/section_4.15)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)]

## Treatment of Stage II Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

Surgery and/or radiation therapy may be used, depending on the exact site.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]

### Treatment Options for Small Lesions of the Lip

Treatment options for stage II small lesions of the lip include:

1. Surgery is used for patients with smaller T2 lesions on the lower lip, if simple closure
produces an acceptable cosmetic result.
2. Radiation therapy, which may include external-beam and/or interstitial techniques, as appropriate, has
the advantage of producing a relatively better functional and cosmetic result,
with intact skin and muscle innervation, if a reconstructive surgical procedure is required.

### Treatment Options for Small Anterior Tongue Lesions

Treatment options for stage II small anterior tongue lesions include:

1. Radiation therapy is usually selected for patients with T2 lesions that have minimal
infiltration to preserve speech and swallowing.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)]
2. Surgery is reserved for
patients for whom radiation treatment failed.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)]
3. Neck dissection may be
considered when primary brachytherapy is used.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)]
4. Surgery, radiation therapy,
or a combination of both are used for deeply infiltrative lesions.

### Treatment Options for Small Lesions of the Buccal Mucosa

Treatment options for stage II small lesions of the buccal mucosa include:

1. Radiation therapy is the usual treatment for patients with small T2 lesions (≤3 cm).
2. Surgery, radiation
therapy, or a combination of these are used, if indicated to treat large T2 lesions (>3 cm). Radiation therapy is often used if the lesion involves the commissure. Surgery is often used, if tumor invades the mandible or maxilla.

### Treatment Options for Small Lesions of the Floor of the Mouth

Treatment options for stage II small lesions of the floor of the mouth include:

1. Surgery is often used for patients with small T2 lesions (≤3 cm) if the lesion is attached to the periosteum.
2. Radiation therapy is often used to treat patients with small T2 lesions (≤3 cm) if the lesion encroaches on the tongue.
3. Surgery and radiation therapy are
alternative methods of treatment for patients with large T2 lesions (>3 cm), the choice of which depends primarily on the
expected extent of disability from surgery.
4. External-beam radiation therapy with or without interstitial radiation therapy should be
considered postoperatively for larger lesions.

### Treatment Options for Small Lesions of the Lower Gingiva

Treatment options for stage II small lesions of the lower gingiva include:

1. Intraoral resection with or without a rim
resection of bone and repair with a split-thickness skin graft are used to treat patients with small lesions.

## Treatment of Stage III Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

Surgery and/or radiation therapy are used, depending on the exact tumor
site.[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[2](#cit/section_7.2)] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as given in clinical trials, has been
used to shrink tumors and render them more definitively treatable with
either surgery or radiation. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given prior to the
other modalities, as opposed to standard adjuvant chemotherapy, which is given
after or during definitive therapy with radiation or after surgery. Many drug
combinations have been used as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)-[6](#cit/section_7.6)] However, randomized, prospective trials have yet to demonstrate a benefit in either
disease-free survival or overall survival for patients receiving neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.[[7](#cit/section_7.7)]

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Lip

These lesions, including those involving bone, nerves, and lymph nodes,
generally require a combination of surgery and radiation therapy.

Treatment options for stage III advanced lesions of the lip include:

1. Surgery using a variety of approaches, the choice of which is dependent on the size and location of the lesion and the need for reconstruction.
2. Radiation therapy using a variety of techniques, including external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without brachytherapy, the choice of which is dictated by the size and location of the lesion.
3. Clinical trials for advanced tumors evaluating the use of chemotherapy
preoperatively, before radiation therapy, as adjuvant therapy after surgery, or
as part of combined modality therapy are appropriate.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)-[6](#cit/section_7.6),[8](#cit/section_7.8)-[10](#cit/section_7.10)]
4. Superfractionated radiation therapy (under clinical evaluation).[[11](#cit/section_7.11)]

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced (Late T2, Small T3) Lesions of the Anterior Tongue

Treatment options for stage III moderately advanced (late T2, small T3) lesions of the anterior tongue include:

1. EBRT with or
without interstitial implant is used to treat minimally infiltrative lesions.
2. Surgery with postoperative radiation
therapy is used to treat deeply infiltrative lesions.[[2](#cit/section_7.2)]

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Buccal Mucosa

Treatment options for stage III advanced lesions of the buccal mucosa include:

1. Radical surgical resection alone.
2. Radiation therapy alone.
3. Surgical resection plus radiation therapy, generally postoperative.
4. Clinical trials for advanced tumors evaluating the use of chemotherapy
preoperatively, before radiation therapy, as adjuvant therapy after surgery, or
as part of combined modality therapy are appropriate.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)-[6](#cit/section_7.6),[8](#cit/section_7.8)-[10](#cit/section_7.10),[12](#cit/section_7.12)]

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Floor of the Mouth

neck dissection, as appropriate.
2. Radiation therapy using EBRT alone or EBRT plus an interstitial implant.
3. Clinical trials for advanced tumors evaluating the use of chemotherapy
preoperatively, before radiation therapy, as adjuvant therapy after surgery, or
as part of combined modality therapy are appropriate.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)-[6](#cit/section_7.6),[8](#cit/section_7.8)-[10](#cit/section_7.10),[12](#cit/section_7.12)]
4. Clinical trials using novel radiation therapy fractionation schemas.[[13](#cit/section_7.13)]

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Lower Gingiva

Treatment options for stage III moderately advanced lesions of the lower gingiva include:

1. Combined radiation therapy and radical resection or radical
resection alone are used to treat extensive lesions with moderate bone destruction and/or nodal metastases. Radiation therapy may be administered either preoperatively or
postoperatively.

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Retromolar Trigone

Treatment options for stage III advanced lesions of the retromolar trigone include:

1. Surgical composite resection, which may be followed by postoperative radiation
therapy.
2. Clinical trials for advanced tumors evaluating the use of chemotherapy
preoperatively, before radiation therapy, as adjuvant therapy after surgery, or
as part of combined modality therapy are appropriate.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)-[6](#cit/section_7.6),[8](#cit/section_7.8)-[10](#cit/section_7.10),[12](#cit/section_7.12)]
3. Clinical trials using novel radiation therapy fractionation schemas.[[13](#cit/section_7.13)]

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Upper Gingiva

Treatment options for stage III moderately advanced lesions of the upper gingiva include:

1. Radiation therapy alone is used to treat superficial lesions with extensive involvement of the gingiva, hard palate, or soft palate.
2. A combination of surgery and radiation therapy is used to treat deeply invasive lesions involving bone.

### Treatment Options for Moderately Advanced Lesions of the Hard Palate

Treatment options for stage III moderately advanced lesions of the hard palate include:

1. Radiation therapy alone is used to treat superficial lesions with extensive involvement of the gingiva, hard palate, or soft palate.
2. A combination of
surgery and radiation therapy or surgery alone is used to treat deeply invasive lesions involving bone.

### Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for All Stage III Lip and Oral Cavity Cancers

1. Chemotherapy has been combined with radiation therapy in patients who have
locally advanced disease that is surgically unresectable.[[8](#cit/section_7.8),[10](#cit/section_7.10),[14](#cit/section_7.14),[15](#cit/section_7.15)]

A meta-analysis of 63 randomized prospective trials published between 1965 and
1993 showed an 8% absolute survival advantage in the subset of patients
who received concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[[16](#cit/section_7.16)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Patients who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy had no
survival advantage. Cost, quality of life, and morbidity data were
not available. No standard regimen existed, and the trials were felt to be
too heterogenous to provide definitive recommendations. The results of 18
ongoing trials may further clarify the role of concurrent chemotherapy and
radiation therapy in the management of oral cavity cancer.

The best chemotherapy to use and the appropriate way to integrate the two
modalities is still unresolved.[[17](#cit/section_7.17)]

Similar approaches in the patient with resectable disease, in whom resection

## Treatment of Stage IV Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

Randomized prospective trials have yet to demonstrate a benefit in either
disease-free survival or overall survival for patients receiving neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.[[1](#cit/section_8.1)] The use of isotretinoin daily for 1
year to prevent development of second upper aerodigestive tract primaries is
under clinical evaluation.[[2](#cit/section_8.2)]

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Lip

These lesions, including those involving bone, nerves, and lymph nodes,
generally require a combination of surgery and radiation therapy.

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the lip include:

1. Surgery using a variety of approaches, the choice of which is dependent on the size and location of the lesion and the need for reconstruction. Treatment of both
sides of the neck is indicated for selected patients.
2. Radiation therapy using a variety of techniques, including external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without brachytherapy, the choice of which is dictated by the size and location of the lesion.
3. Superfractionated radiation therapy (under clinical evaluation).[[3](#cit/section_8.3)]

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Anterior Tongue

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the anterior tongue include:

1. Combined surgery (i.e., total glossectomy, sometimes requiring
laryngectomy), possibly followed by postoperative radiation therapy, may be used to treat selected patients.[[4](#cit/section_8.4)]
2. Palliative radiation therapy may be used to treat patients with very advanced lesions.

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Buccal Mucosa

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the buccal mucosa include:

1. Radical surgical resection alone.
2. Radiation therapy alone.
3. Surgical resection plus radiation therapy, which is generally administered postoperatively.

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Floor of the Mouth

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the floor of the mouth include:

1. A combination of surgery and radiation therapy, which is generally administered postoperatively, is often used.
2. Preoperative radiation therapy is often used for fixed nodes (≥5 cm).

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Lower Gingiva

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the lower gingiva include:

1. Surgery, radiation therapy, or a
combination of both are poor controls for advanced tumors with extensive destruction of the mandible and with nodal metastases.

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Retromolar Trigone

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the retromolar trigone include:

1. Surgical composite resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy.

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Upper Gingiva

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the upper gingiva include:

1. Surgery in combination with radiation therapy is generally used to treat lesions that are extensive and infiltrating.

### Treatment Options for Advanced Lesions of the Hard Palate

Treatment options for stage IV advanced lesions of the hard palate include:

1. Surgery in combination with radiation therapy is generally used to treat lesions that are extensive and infiltrating.

### Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for All Stage IV Lip and Oral Cavity Cancers

1. Chemotherapy has been combined with radiation therapy in patients who
have locally advanced disease that is surgically unresectable.[[5](#cit/section_8.5)-[8](#cit/section_8.8)]

A meta-analysis of 63 randomized prospective trials published between 1965 and
1993 showed an 8% absolute survival advantage in the subset of patients
who received concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[[9](#cit/section_8.9)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Patients who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy had no
survival advantage. Cost, quality of life, and morbidity data were
not available. No standard regimen existed, and the trials were felt to be
too heterogenous to provide definitive recommendations. The results of 18
ongoing trials may further clarify the role of concurrent chemotherapy and
radiation therapy in the management of oral cavity cancer.

The best chemotherapy to use and the appropriate way to integrate the two
modalities is still unresolved.[[10](#cit/section_8.10)]

Similar approaches in the patient with resectable disease, in whom resection
would lead to a major functional deficit, are also being explored in randomized
trials but cannot be recommended at this time as standard.
2. Clinical trials for advanced tumors evaluating the use of chemotherapy
preoperatively, before radiation therapy, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery
are appropriate.[[5](#cit/section_8.5),[11](#cit/section_8.11)-[18](#cit/section_8.18)]
3. Clinical trials of novel fractionation radiation therapy are under evaluation.[[19](#cit/section_8.19)]

## Treatment Options for Management of Lymph Node Metastases

Patients with advanced lesions should have elective lymph node radiation
therapy or node dissection. The risk of metastases to lymph nodes is increased
by high-grade histology, large lesions, spread to involve the wet mucosa of the
lip or the buccal mucosa in patients with recurrent disease, and invasion of
muscle (i.e., orbicularis oris).[[1](#cit/section_9.1)]

Treatment options for management of lymph node metastases include:

1. Radiation therapy alone or neck dissection:

- N1 (0–2 cm).
- N2b or N3; all nodes smaller than 2 cm. (A combined surgical and
radiation therapy approach should also be considered.)
2. Radiation therapy and neck dissection:

- N1 (2–3 cm), N2a, N3.
3. Surgery followed by radiation therapy, indications for which are as follows:

- Multiple positive nodes.
- Contralateral subclinical metastases.
- Invasion of tumor through the capsule of the lymph node.
- N2b or N3 (one or more nodes in each side of the neck, as appropriate, >2 cm).
4. Radiation therapy prior to surgery:

- Large fixed nodes.

## Treatment of Metastatic and Recurrent Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

For lesions of the lip, anterior tongue, buccal mucosa, floor of the mouth,
retromolar trigone, upper gingiva, and hard palate, treatment is dictated
by the location and size of the recurrent lesion as well as prior
treatment.[[1](#cit/section_10.1),[2](#cit/section_10.2)]

### Treatment Options for Metastatic and Recurrent Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer

Treatment options for metastatic and recurrent lip and oral cavity cancer include:

1. Surgery is the preferred treatment if radiation therapy was used initially.[[3](#cit/section_10.3)]
2. Surgery,[[3](#cit/section_10.3)] radiation
therapy, or a combination of these treatments may be considered if surgery was used to treat the lesion initially.

evaluating new chemotherapy drugs, chemotherapy and re-irradiation, or

radiation therapy after primary surgery give poor results.[[14](#cit/section_10.14),[15](#cit/section_10.15)]

#### Immunotherapy

###### Pembrolizumab

Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody and an inhibitor of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway. Studies have evaluated pembrolizumab in patients with incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Evidence (pembrolizumab as first-line therapy):

1. [KEYNOTE-048](/clinicaltrials/NCT02358031) (NCT02358031) was a nonblinded, randomized, phase III study of participants with untreated locally incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC that was performed at 200 sites in 37 countries.[[6](#cit/section_10.6)] A total of 882 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab alone (n = 301), pembrolizumab plus a platinum and fluorouracil (5-FU) (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy) (n = 281), or cetuximab plus a platinum and 5-FU (cetuximab with chemotherapy) (n = 300). Investigators, patients, and representatives of the sponsor were masked to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) results; PD-L1 positivity was not required for study entry. A total of 754 patients (85%) had a CPS of 1 or higher and 381 patients (43%) had a CPS of 20 or higher.

The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Progression was defined as radiographically confirmed disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, in the intention-to-treat population.

1. At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab alone showed improved or noninferior OS compared with cetuximab with chemotherapy. The median OS results were reported as follows:[[6](#cit/section_10.6)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Among the population with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median OS was 14.9 months in patients who received pembrolizumab alone and 10.7 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45–0.83; *P* = .0007).
- Among the population with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 12.3 months in patients who received pembrolizumab alone and 10.3 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96; *P* = .0086).
- Among the total population, patients who received pembrolizumab alone had noninferior OS (11.6 months) compared with patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (10.7 months) (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.03; *P* = .0456).
2. Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy showed improved OS versus cetuximab with chemotherapy. The OS results were reported as follows:

- At the second interim analysis, among the total population, the median OS was 13.0 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 10.7 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93; *P* = .0034).
- At the final analysis, among the population with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median OS was 14.7 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 11.0 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.82; *P* = .0004).
- At the final analysis, among the population with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 13.6 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 10.4 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.80; *P* < .0001).
3. At the second interim analysis, neither pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved PFS.
4. At the final analysis, grade 3 or higher all-cause adverse events occurred in 164 of 300 patients (55%) in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 235 of 276 patients (85%) who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and 239 of 287 patients (83%) who received cetuximab with chemotherapy.
5. Adverse events led to death in 25 patients (8%) in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 32 patients (12%) who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and 28 patients (10%) who received cetuximab with chemotherapy.

Pembrolizumab plus a platinum and 5-FU is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC. Pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1–positive metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC. These results were confirmed at a longer median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range, 41.0–49.2).[[7](#cit/section_10.7)]

Evidence (pembrolizumab after progression on platinum-based treatment):

1. The phase III [KEYNOTE-040](/clinicaltrials/NCT02252042) (NCT02252042) trial included patients with incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC who had received platinum-based treatment within 3 to 6 months.[[4](#cit/section_10.4)] Patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab arm (200 mg every 3 weeks [247 patients]) or to the standard therapy arm of the investigator’s choice (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab [248 patients]). Patients received treatment until progression or toxicity. The maximum duration of pembrolizumab was 24 months. The primary end point was OS in the intention-to-treat population.

- The median OS was 8.4 months in the pembrolizumab arm and 6.9 months in the standard therapy arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.98; nominal *P* = .0161).[[4](#cit/section_10.4)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- Pembrolizumab was associated with fewer grade 3 or higher adverse events (pembrolizumab, 13% vs. standard therapy, 36%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were hypothyroidism (13%) in the pembrolizumab arm and fatigue (18%) in the standard therapy arm.
- In patients who received pembrolizumab, there were four treatment-related deaths resulting from large intestinal perforation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and unspecified malignant progression. Two treatment-related deaths in the standard therapy arm resulted from malignant progression and pneumonia.
- The PD-L1 CPS was 1 or higher in 79% of the patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 77% of the patients in the standard therapy arm.
- Compared with patients treated with standard therapy, a reduced HRdeath was noted for patients who received pembrolizumab and had PD-1 expression on their tumors or in the tumor microenvironment as noted by a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.93; nominal *P* = .0049) or a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or higher (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.81; nominal *P* = .0014).

###### Nivolumab

Nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

Evidence (nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in patients who have not previously received systemic therapy):

1. The [CheckMate 651](/clinicaltrials/NCT02741570) trial (NCT02741570) evaluated first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME (cetuximab, cisplatin/carboplatin, and 5-FU for up to six cycles followed by cetuximab maintenance) in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.[[9](#cit/section_10.9)] The primary end points were OS in all randomly assigned patients and patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher. Secondary end points included OS in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher and PFS, objective response rate, and duration of response in all randomly assigned patients and patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher.

- Among all randomly assigned patients, there was no statistically significant difference in OS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME (median OS, 13.9 vs. 13.5 months; HR, 0.95; 97.9% CI, 0.80–1.13; *P* = .4951). Among patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher, there was also no statistically significant OS difference between the two treatments (median OS, 17.6 vs. 14.6 months; HR, 0.78; 97.51% CI, 0.59–1.03; *P* = .0469).[[9](#cit/section_10.9)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- In patients with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 15.7 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2 months for patients who received EXTREME (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97).
- Among patients with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median PFS was 5.4 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 7.0 months for patients who received EXTREME. The objective response rate was 34.1% for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.0% for patients who received EXTREME.
- Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 28.2% of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 70.7% of patients who received EXTREME.
- CheckMate 651 did not meet its primary end points of OS in the randomly assigned or CPS of 20 or higher populations.

The absence of a survival benefit for immune checkpoint inhibitors in this trial was an unexpected outcome, given the similarity of nivolumab to pembrolizumab in the studies of patients with cisplatin-refractory disease.[[4](#cit/section_10.4),[5](#cit/section_10.5)] An editorial accompanying the CheckMate 651 trial analyzed some of the factors that may have contributed to a different result. The editorial suggested that survival in the control group, which was longer than that reported in prior studies, may have been impacted by the greater availability of second-line immunotherapy in the control group (46% in CheckMate 651 compared with 25% in the KEYNOTE-048 trial). The authors also suggested that the coadministration of ipilimumab detracted from the activity of nivolumab, as shown in the CheckMate 714 trial.[[8](#cit/section_10.8)]
2. [CheckMate 714](/clinicaltrials/NCT02823574) (NCT02823574), a double-blind phase II trial, evaluated the clinical benefit of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in 425 patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.[[10](#cit/section_10.10)] Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously [IV] every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks) or nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) plus placebo. Treatment continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or consent withdrawal. The primary end points were objective response rate and duration of response between treatment arms by blinded independent central review in the population with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic disease. These were patients who had recurrent disease less than 6 months after completion of platinum-based chemotherapy (adjuvant or neoadjuvant, or as part of multimodal treatment [chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy]). Among the 241 patients (56.7%) with platinum-refractory disease, 159 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 82 were assigned to receive nivolumab alone. Among the 184 patients (43.3%) with platinum-eligible disease, 123 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 61 were assigned to receive nivolumab alone.[[10](#cit/section_10.10)][[Level of evidence B3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810031&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- At primary database lock, the objective response rate in the population with platinum-refractory disease was 13.2% (95% CI, 8.4%–19.5%) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 18.3% (95% CI, 10.6%–28.4%) with nivolumab alone (odds ratio, 0.68; 95.5% CI, 0.33–1.43; *P* = .29).
- The median duration of response was not reached (NR) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group (95% CI, 11.0 months–NR) and was 11.1 months (95% CI, 4.1–NR) in the nivolumab-alone group.
In the population with platinum-eligible disease, the objective response rate was 20.3% (95% CI, 13.6%–28.5%) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 29.5% (95% CI, 18.5%–42.6%) with nivolumab alone.
- Among the population with platinum-refractory disease, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 25 of 158 patients (15.8%) who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 12 of 82 patients (14.6%) who received nivolumab alone. Among the population with platinum-eligible disease, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 30 of 122 patients (24.6%) who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 8 of 61 patients (13.1%) who received nivolumab alone.
- This trial did not meet its primary end point of objective response rate benefit with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in patients with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.

Evidence (nivolumab after progression on platinum-based treatment):

1. A phase III open-label trial included 361 patients with recurrent SCC of the head and neck and disease progression within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was OS.[[5](#cit/section_10.5)]

- The median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.5–9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0–6.0) in the standard therapy group. OS was statistically significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy (HRdeath, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51–0.96; *P* = .01). The estimated 1-year survival rate was approximately 19% higher in patients who received nivolumab (36.0%) than in those who received standard therapy (16.6%).[[5](#cit/section_10.5)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- There was no statistically significant difference in median PFS between treatment groups. The 6-month PFS rate was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy.
- The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard therapy group.
- Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group compared with 35.1% of the patients in the standard therapy group.
- Quality-of-life outcomes—including physical, role, and social functioning and pain, sensory, and social contact problems—were stable in the nivolumab group but worse in the standard therapy group. These outcomes were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Core Module (QLQ-C30) and the Head and Neck Module (QLQ-H&N35).
- In the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 1% or higher, the HRdeath among patients treated with nivolumab versus standard therapy was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.36–0.83). In the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level lower than 1%, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.54–1.45; *P* = .17 for interaction).
2. A randomized, phase III, superiority study in India evaluated the dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of palliative care for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. Low-dose IV nivolumab (20 mg every 3 weeks) was added to a triple metronomic chemotherapy regimen of oral methotrexate (9 mg/m2 once weekly), celecoxib (200 mg twice daily), and erlotinib (150 mg once daily). Notably, this nivolumab dose is less than 10% of the dose recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to receive either triple metronomic chemotherapy alone (n = 75) or triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (n = 76). The primary end point was 1-year OS.[[11](#cit/section_10.11)]

- The addition of low-dose nivolumab to triple metronomic chemotherapy improved the 1-year OS rate from 16.3% (95% CI, 8.0%–27.4%) to 43.4% (95% CI, 30.8%–55.3%) (HR, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.362–0.820; *P* = .0036).[[11](#cit/section_10.11)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- The median OS was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8–8.1) for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy alone and 10.1 months (95% CI, 7.4–12.6) for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (*P* = .0052).
- The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 50% for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy alone and 46.1% for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (*P* = .744).

Although the control arm in this study cannot be considered standard care, lower doses of immunotherapy appeared to have some benefit in this setting.[[12](#cit/section_10.12)]
