## Incidence, Risk Factors, and Clinical Presentation

[Go to Patient Version](/types/mesothelioma/patient/child-mesothelioma-treatment-pdq)

Mesothelioma is extremely rare in children and adolescents, with only 2% to 5% of patients presenting during the first two decades of life.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Fewer than 300 cases in children have been reported.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] An analysis from the National Cancer Database identified 46 pediatric patients (aged 0–21 years) and 524 young adult patients (aged 22–39 years) with mesothelioma (363 peritoneal and 207 pleural).[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] Patients with peritoneal mesothelioma were more frequently female (63.1%). The mean overall survival was higher in patients with peritoneal mesothelioma (125 months) than in those with pleural mesothelioma (69 months), which remained significant after stratification of pediatric and young adult patients.

In adults, increased mesothelioma risk is associated with inherited *BAP1* variants, exposures to asbestos, and exposures to radiation therapy during previous cancer treatments. These risk factors are rare in pediatric patients, and there are limited data that address cancer risk in children with asbestos exposures. The amount of radiation exposure required to develop cancer is
also unknown.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)-[8](#cit/section_1.8)]

Mesothelioma may present in the thoracic/pleural region or in the peritoneum. These presentations have different clinical courses and prognoses. This cancer can involve the membranous coverings of the lung, the heart, or the
abdominal organs.[[9](#cit/section_1.9)-[11](#cit/section_1.11)]; [[12](#cit/section_1.12)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Mesothelioma can spread onto organ surfaces
without invading far into the underlying tissue. This cancer may also spread to regional or
distant lymph nodes.

Benign and malignant mesotheliomas cannot be differentiated using histological
criteria. Benign mesotheliomas are exceedingly rare and often occur in the peritoneal cavity. A poor prognosis is associated with mesotheliomas that are diffuse and
invasive or with mesotheliomas that recur.

## Genomic Alterations

Malignant mesotheliomas found in children, adolescents, and young adults are not often associated with asbestos exposures. This differs from most malignant mesotheliomas seen in adults. Recurring *ALK* gene fusions have been described in children and adolescents with mesothelioma. These fusions occur most often in female patients with peritoneal primary mesotheliomas. *ALK* gene fusions involve various partner genes, including *STRN*, *TPM1*, and *EML4*.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

## Diagnostic Evaluation

In suspicious cases of malignant mesotheliomas, diagnostic thoracoscopy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Cross-sectional imaging may suggest the diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma, but diagnostic biopsy by laparoscopy or open laparotomy is required.

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Ophthalmologists.
- Rehabilitation
specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families. Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[[3](#cit/section_4.3)-[5](#cit/section_4.5)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)] The U.S. [Rare Diseases Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf "https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf") defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.

The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[[7](#cit/section_4.7),[8](#cit/section_4.8)] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:

- A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)]
- The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[[10](#cit/section_4.10)] These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as [Malignant Mesothelioma Treatment](/types/mesothelioma/hp/mesothelioma-treatment-pdq).

## Treatment of Childhood Mesothelioma

Treatment options for pediatric patients with malignant pleural mesotheliomas are controversial. Outcomes are often poor in these individuals despite treatment with radical surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Treatments that use newer chemotherapy agents and immunotherapies are under investigation.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]

Treatment options for childhood malignant mesothelioma include the following:

1. [Surgery](/types/mesothelioma/hp/child-mesothelioma-treatment-pdq#_2464).
2. [Chemotherapy](/types/mesothelioma/hp/child-mesothelioma-treatment-pdq#_2465).
3. [Surgery and hyperthermic compartmental chemotherapy](/types/mesothelioma/hp/child-mesothelioma-treatment-pdq#_2467).
4. [Radiation therapy](/types/mesothelioma/hp/child-mesothelioma-treatment-pdq#_2468).
5. [Targeted therapy (ceritinib)](/types/mesothelioma/hp/child-mesothelioma-treatment-pdq#_2469).

### Surgery

Radical surgical resection has been attempted in patients with mesotheliomas, with mixed results.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] In adults, durable responses may be achieved with multimodal therapy that includes extrapleural pneumonectomy and radiation therapy after combination chemotherapy with pemetrexed-cisplatin.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] However, this approach remains highly controversial.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)]

### Chemotherapy

The European Cooperative Study Group on Pediatric Rare Tumors retrospectively reviewed children, adolescents, and young adults (aged ≤21 years) with mesotheliomas who were treated between 1987 and 2018.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] Investigators identified 15 male patients and 18 female patients with mesotheliomas. Only one patient had a documented asbestos exposure. In most patients, the primary tumor was located in the peritoneum (23 patients). Tumor histologies were either multicystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum (6 patients) or malignant mesothelioma (27 patients).

- The response rate to treatment with cisplatin-pemetrexed was 50% (6 of 12 cases).
- After a median follow-up period of 6.7 years (range, 0–20 years), the 5-year overall survival rate was 82.3%, and the event-free survival rate was 45.1%.
- All patients with multicystic mesothelioma remained alive after either surgery (5 patients) or cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (1 patient).

### Surgery and Hyperthermic Compartmental Chemotherapy

Hyperthermic intrapleural/intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been used to treat pleural and intraperitoneal mesotheliomas. HIPEC, in conjunction with radical surgical resection, has been used to treat adults with pleural mesotheliomas. Although results have been encouraging, HIPEC has not been validated in controlled clinical trials because pleural mesotheliomas are rare.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[6](#cit/section_5.6),[7](#cit/section_5.7)] A single-institution study followed seven children with intraperitoneal mesotheliomas who were treated with surgery and HIPEC.[[8](#cit/section_5.8)] At last available follow-up, five of the seven patients were alive and had either minimal disease or no evaluable disease.

### Radiation Therapy

Pain is an infrequent symptom in patients with mesotheliomas. However, if pain occurs, radiation therapy may be
used for palliation.

### Targeted Therapy (Ceritinib)

In one case report, a 13-year-old patient with a peritoneal mesothelioma and a *STRN*::*ALK* fusion gene responded to ceritinib treatment.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)]

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of childhood mesothelioma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
