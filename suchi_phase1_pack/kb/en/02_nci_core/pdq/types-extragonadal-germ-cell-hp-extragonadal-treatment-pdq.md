### Incidence and Mortality

Extragonadal germ cell tumors are rare and account for only a small percentage
of all germ cell tumors. However, the true incidence of these tumors may
conceivably be higher than originally thought because of failure to diagnose
them properly.

## Cellular Classification of Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors

Extragonadal germ cell tumors can be benign (teratoma) or malignant. The
latter group can be divided into seminoma and nonseminoma germ cell tumors, which include:

- Embryonal carcinomas.
- Malignant teratomas.
- Endodermal sinus tumors.
- Choriocarcinomas.
- Mixed germ cell tumors.

Extragonadal germ cell tumors occur much more often in males than in females [[1](#cit/section_2.1)] and are usually seen in young adults. These aggressive neoplasms can arise virtually anywhere, but the site of origin is typically
in the midline (mediastinum, retroperitoneum, or pineal
gland). Gonadal origin should be excluded by careful testicular examination
and ultrasound. The diagnosis can be difficult and should be considered in any
patient with a poorly defined epithelial malignancy, particularly young
individuals with midline masses.[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

An international germ cell tumor prognostic classification has been developed
based on a retrospective analysis of 5,202 patients with metastatic
nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and 660 patients with metastatic seminomatous germ cell
tumors.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] All patients received treatment with cisplatin-containing or carboplatin-containing therapy as their first chemotherapy course. The prognostic
classification, shown below, was agreed on in early 1997 by all major clinical
trial groups worldwide and should be used for the reporting of clinical trial
results of patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.

## Treatment of Benign Teratoma

Benign teratomas are treated with surgical excision only. These tumors are
frequently very large, and the surgical procedure can be formidable.

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. [General information](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials") about clinical trials is also available.

## Treatment of Seminoma

The diagnosis of seminoma requires that the serum alpha-fetoprotein be
normal, with no other germ cells present. Management decisions in patients presenting with these tumors can be difficult.

As in testicular seminoma, these tumors
are very radiosensitive. About 60% to 80% of patients will remain disease free after
treatment with radiation therapy.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] Craniospinal radiation therapy for intracranial germinomas (the
intracranial counterpart of seminoma) is associated with relapse-free and
overall survival rates of 90% to 95% at 5 years, respectively, as evidenced in the GER-GPO-MAKEI-86/89 trial, for example.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Initial chemotherapy with regimens used in nonseminoma testicular cancer is also
efficacious. Practically speaking, patients with localized relatively
small tumors are usually treated initially with radiation therapy, while those with
very bulky tumors or nonlocalized tumors are treated with etoposide-based and
cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens.

As in testicular seminoma, many patients will be left with a residual mass posttreatment. If the residual mass is smaller than 3.0 cm,
most experts agree that observation is appropriate. In those with larger residual
masses, some experts favor surgical excision while others favor
observation.[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

## Treatment of Nonseminoma

Patients with nonseminomas should receive chemotherapy at diagnosis. These
patients tend to have a large tumor volume at diagnosis and are usually
symptomatic. Initial debulking surgery is rarely useful. Many high-risk
patients qualify for clinical trials.
Standard therapy is generally four courses of
BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin).[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

A randomized study comparing
four courses of BEP with four courses of VIP (etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin)
showed similar overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment failure for the two
regimens in patients with advanced disseminated germ cell tumors who had not
received previous chemotherapy.[[3](#cit/section_5.3),[4](#cit/section_5.4)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Of the 304 patients in this study, 66 had extragonadal primary tumors. In this subset
of patients, responses to the two regimens were similar. Hematologic toxic effects in OS were substantially worse with the VIP regimen than with the BEP
regimen.

Patients with a residual mass after
chemotherapy may achieve long-term disease-free survival after postchemotherapy surgery with resection of all
residual disease.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Patients with nonseminomatous extragonadal germ cell tumors
who relapse after front-line chemotherapy generally have poor prognoses with
poor responses to salvage chemotherapy regimens, including autologous bone
marrow transplant, that have had success for recurrent testicular
cancer.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)-[8](#cit/section_5.8)] Such patients are candidates for studies of new
approaches.

### Mediastinal Nonseminoma

Mediastinal nonseminomas have certain unique aspects. The tumors are more frequent in
individuals with Klinefelter syndrome and are associated with a risk of
subsequent development of hematologic neoplasia that is not treatment related.[[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10)] Approximately 50% of patients with mediastinal nonseminomas will survive with appropriate
management.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)] High risk is partially related to tumor bulk, chemotherapy
resistance, and a predisposition to develop hematologic neoplasia and other
nongerm cell malignancies.
In an uncontrolled study, some patients with a postchemotherapy residual mediastinal mass achieved long-term disease-free survival after complete resection, even when serum tumor markers were elevated.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Patient selection factors may play a role in these favorable outcomes.

### Retroperitoneal Nonseminoma

The prognosis of retroperitoneal nonseminoma is reasonably good and, similar to
the situation with nodal metastasis from a testicular primary tumor, is related to
tumor volume.

## Treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors

A randomized controlled trial compared conventional doses of salvage chemotherapy to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous marrow rescue in 263 patients with recurrent or refractory germ cell tumors. Of the 263 patients, 43 of whom had extragonadal primary tumors, more toxic effects and treatment-related deaths were seen in the high-dose arm, without any improvement in response rate or overall survival.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
