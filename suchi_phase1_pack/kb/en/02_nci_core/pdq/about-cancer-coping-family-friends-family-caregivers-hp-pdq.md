# Informal Caregivers in Cancer: Roles, Burden, and Support (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Overview

[Go to Patient Version](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-pdq)

**Informal caregiving** is broadly defined as services provided by an unpaid person, such as helping with personal needs and household chores, managing a person's finances, arranging for outside services, or visiting regularly.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[2](#cit/section_1.2)] An informal caregiver is usually a relative or friend and may or may not live in the same household as the person with cancer.

Informal caregiving provides significant practical and economic benefits. This summary describes the experiences of informal caregivers of people with cancer, explains the risk factors for caregiver burden (which is often associated with negative psychological consequences), and evaluates evidence-based interventions designed to reduce the burden of informal caregiving. The goal of the summary is to provide the oncology clinician with both a deeper appreciation of the importance of informal caregivers, and the information necessary to recognize burdened caregivers and effectively intervene.

### Who Are Informal Caregivers and What Roles Do They Play?

In 2016, the National Alliance for Caregiving reported an analysis of the survey responses of 111 caregivers who self-identified as providing care to a person with cancer.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] The respondents were part of a much larger study that identified a representative sample of adult caregivers who provided unpaid care to an adult relative or friend in the 12 months preceding the time of the survey.

The following findings provide a snapshot of informal caregivers of people with cancer and the challenges they face:

- 58% were women.
- 88% cared for a relative.
- 39% lived with the person being cared for.
- 50% reported high emotional stress related to caregiving.
- 25% reported high financial strain.
- 50% were employed while caregiving, working an average of 35 hours per week.
- 73% were involved in discussions about care during hospitalization; however, only about half of them (54%) were asked what help was needed after discharge.
- 72% assisted with medical tasks.
- 43% reported needing help to manage emotional and physical stress.
- 40% wanted help making end-of-life decisions.
- 33% wanted help keeping their friend or relative safe at home.
- Caregiving for patients with cancer was noted to be episodic and lasted for approximately 2 years on average.

Caregiving is also relational.[[4](#cit/section_1.4),[5](#cit/section_1.5)] In addition, there are important implications for the interconnectedness between patient and caregiver that the oncology clinician should be aware of, including the following:

- Patients and caregivers influence each other’s mental and physical health (partner effects) in addition to their own outcomes (actor effects).[[6](#cit/section_1.6)]
- The psychological well-being of caregivers seems to influence patients’ evaluations of the quality of their care. One survey of 689 patients and their caregivers demonstrated that higher levels of depression in caregivers were associated with patients’ ratings of lower quality of care.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]
- There are important distinctions between the experiences of patients and informal caregivers. A semistructured interview study of 23 patients with advanced colorectal cancer and 23 caregivers demonstrated the prevalence and nature of these differences.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)] Participants agreed on four challenges:

- Emotionally processing the initial diagnosis or recurrence.
- Managing the practical and emotional aspects of patient care.
- Facing an uncertain future.
- Encountering symptom-related suffering.

In no instance, however, did patient and caregiver identify the same key challenge. Clinicians are advised to assess caregiver needs independent of patient needs.
- The caregiver may not be an accurate informant of the patient’s experience. One study demonstrated that caregivers correctly reported 67% of patients’ physical difficulties, 69% of patients’ psychological difficulties, and 40% of patients’ social difficulties.[[9](#cit/section_1.9)] There were no predictive demographic factors. In further support of the need for caution, an analysis of office visits recorded on audiotape revealed that caregivers often spoke on behalf of patients without validation by the patients.[[10](#cit/section_1.10)] In addition to this pseudo-surrogacy, caregivers often conflated their concerns with those of the patients.

### The Psychological Consequences of Caregiving

The psychological consequences of caregiving vary widely. Some caregivers report positive outcomes such as post-traumatic growth and benefit finding. But a minority of caregivers experience anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

**Benefit finding:** Results of several qualitative studies (interviews or narrative questionnaires) of caregivers of either adult cancer survivors [[11](#cit/section_1.11),[12](#cit/section_1.12)] or childhood cancer survivors [[13](#cit/section_1.13),[14](#cit/section_1.14)] revealed common themes on the positive aspects of caregiving:

- Closer relationships with others, including partners and children.
- Greater appreciation of life.
- Clarification of life priorities.
- Increased faith.
- More empathy for others.
- Better health habits.

These common themes are more quantitatively measured by using the Benefit Finding Scale. Six domains of caregivers’ personal growth have been identified [[15](#cit/section_1.15)] and are consistent for both caregivers of survivors and those in bereavement:[[16](#cit/section_1.16)]

- Acceptance.
- Empathy.
- Appreciation.
- Family.
- Positive self-view.
- Reprioritization.

**Anxiety and depression:** Several large survey studies provide more accurate estimates of the prevalence and potential covariates or risk factors for anxiety and depression:

- In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies representing 11,396 caregivers of people with cancer, the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 42.08% (95% confidence interval, 34.71%–49.45%). Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they used validated instruments to assess depression. However, the authors did not differentiate between studies that used cutoff scores associated with mild depressive symptoms and clinically significant depression.[[17](#cit/section_1.17)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- A telephone survey of 196 caregivers of patients with renal cell carcinoma studied the associations between psychological adjustment and caregivers’ experiences and unmet needs. Investigators demonstrated that 64% of caregivers had at least one significant unmet need, 53% had three or more unmet needs, and 29% had ten or more unmet needs.[[18](#cit/section_1.18)] Investigators found elevated anxiety in 29% of respondents and depression in 11%. Unmet information needs and worse experiences of care during surgery were risk factors for caregiver depression. Unmet information needs were the only risk factor for anxiety.
- A cross-sectional analysis assessed baseline data on caregivers of patients with advanced-stage lung or colorectal cancers enrolled in a randomized trial of early palliative care.[[19](#cit/section_1.19)] A significant proportion of caregivers reported elevated levels of anxiety (42.2%) or depression (21.5%). Risk factors for caregiver depression were patients’ expectation of cure and patients’ use of emotional support coping. Patients’ use of acceptance coping was associated with less caregiver anxiety. A study of caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer reported similar results: 39% of caregivers had elevated levels of anxiety, and 14% had elevated levels of depression, compared with community norms.[[20](#cit/section_1.20)]

**PTSD:** One of the negative consequences of caregiving that persists is PTSD. A preliminary study of caregivers of patients with head and neck cancer 6 months after diagnosis demonstrated that approximately 20% met the criteria for PTSD.[[21](#cit/section_1.21)] Risk factors for PTSD included the following:

- Caregiver perception of low treatment benefit.
- Caregiver perception of many patient symptoms.
- Caregiver use of avoidant coping strategies.

The same investigators also showed in a similar population that differences in illness perceptions were dynamic over 6 months, but greater differences were correlated with reduced health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients.[[22](#cit/section_1.22)]

**Decline in caregiver QOL:** Several investigators have published measures of caregiver QOL while patients were undergoing active treatment. One study demonstrated that caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant experience a decline in their QOL, as measured by the physical and mental component of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

Patients receiving palliative therapy also rely heavily on informal caregivers. In a study of 201 informal caregivers of patients undergoing palliative radiation therapy for advanced cancer, additional employment of the caregiver, cohabitation, poor patient performance status, and interest in accessing more support services were significantly correlated with higher caregiver burden (poorer QOL).[[23](#cit/section_1.23)]

In summary, a caregiver provides essential support and resources to the person with cancer. However, the role of informal caregiver creates demands that may exceed the caregiver’s resources and, ultimately, cause negative psychological consequences. The rest of this summary focuses on the significant minority of caregivers who experience unmet needs and increased physical and psychological distress. After a brief review of the concept of caregiver burden, information about the demands on caregivers, resources valued by caregivers, potential moderators of caregiver burden, and coping strategies will be presented.

## Caregiver Burden

The term **caregiver burden** describes a caregiver’s perceptions of the demands of caregiving and the resources available for addressing those demands. The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping is a useful framework for describing the relationships among caregiver demands, resources, burden, and the psychological consequences of being burdened.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] From this perspective, a burden is perceived when the demands on the caregiver exceed the resources available. See the [figure](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_242) below for an illustration of how this framework may be applied to caregiver burden.

The process begins with the primary appraisal, which is a judgment about the relevance of the health threat and any demands on the caregiver. A demand that is judged to be relevant receives a secondary appraisal to evaluate the likelihood that available resources have the potential to reduce or overcome the demand. Burden is perceived to be high when the difficulty of the demand outweighs the available resources. Coping strategies may also determine whether the psychological consequences of the perceived burden are negative or positive.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/799645.jpg)![Chart showing the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, including the primary appraisal of health threats (illness that endangers personal goals and values) and antecedents (age, gender, health status, and employment); secondary appraisal of caregiver demands (daily living tasks, information, transportation, and decision making) and resources (social support, health team, interventions, and palliative care consults); coping (when resources are greater than demands and when demands are greater than resources) and coping strategies (problem focused, emotion focused, and meaning focused); and caregiver outcomes (acceptable burden and negative and positive psychological consequences of being burdened).](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/799645-750.jpg "Chart showing the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, including the primary appraisal of health threats (illness that endangers personal goals and values) and antecedents (age, gender, health status, and employment); secondary appraisal of caregiver demands (daily living tasks, information, transportation, and decision making) and resources (social support, health team, interventions, and palliative care consults); coping (when resources are greater than demands and when demands are greater than resources) and coping strategies (problem focused, emotion focused, and meaning focused); and caregiver outcomes (acceptable burden and negative and positive psychological consequences of being burdened).")

The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping may explain why some caregivers experience burden and negative psychological consequences. Clinicians may intervene to reduce demands, increase resources, or foster adoptive coping. The text for antecedents, demands, and resources is from examples in the text of this summary.

The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping shown above has not been validated and serves to organize the rest of the summary.

### Primary Appraisal: Demands on Informal Caregivers

**Qualitative analysis of interviews:** A mixed-methods study of 48 informal caregivers of patients undergoing chemotherapy demonstrated several notable findings.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)] First, 68% of the caregivers had one or no unmet needs. A minority (23%) had five to ten unmet needs. Second, the most common needs were for information about the risks and potential benefits of chemotherapy (79%) and managing side effects at home (78%). Other information-related needs included information about self-care, complementary and alternative therapies, and local community-based resources.

Another group of investigators interviewed six patients with head and neck cancer and their spouses within 6 months of completing treatment. Thematic analysis identified several unmet needs, including the following:[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

- Better preparation for side effects.
- Clearer timeline of recovery.
- Strategies to deal with the emotions experienced by patients and spouses during treatment.

The complexity of a caregiver’s life was further highlighted in a systematic review of qualitative studies of informal caregivers of patients with cancer and symptoms or signs of cachexia.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] Several themes were identified:

- Impact on everyday life.
- Attempts of caregiver to take charge.
- Need for health care provider input.
- Conflict with patient.
- Negative emotions.

**Surveys:** To provide a more accurate assessment of caregiver needs, investigators developed and demonstrated the psychometric validity of the Supportive Care Needs Survey—Partners and Caregivers (SCNS–P&C).[[5](#cit/section_2.5)] More than 500 caregivers of patients enrolled in a cancer survivor study returned surveys for analysis. The mean age of caregivers was 60.6 years (range, 16–85 years).

The diagnoses of survivors included the following:

- Prostate cancer (32%).
- Blood cancer (16.3%).
- Breast cancer (13.2%).
- Melanoma (11.5%).
- Colorectal cancer (11.3%).
- Head and neck cancer (8.6%).
- Lung cancer (7.1%).

Analysis revealed four domains of needs:

- Health care service.
- Psychological and emotional.
- Work and social.
- Informational.

Investigators used the SCNS–P&C to conduct a telephone survey of 196 caregivers of patients with renal cell carcinoma. They found that 64% of caregivers had at least one significant unmet need, 53% had three or more unmet needs, and 29% had ten or more unmet needs.[[6](#cit/section_2.6)] For each domain of needs, the proportion of respondents reporting a moderate or high unmet need was:

- Health care service, 30%.
- Psychological and emotional, 30%.
- Work and social, 23%.
- Informational, 18%.

In another study, 188 patient-caregiver dyads completed the SCNS–P&C.[[7](#cit/section_2.7)] The caregivers were predominantly female Their average age was 57.8 years. Caregivers reported higher levels of distress and anxiety than patients. A minority (14%) reported no unmet needs, and a plurality (44%) reported ten or more unmet needs. The principal unmet caregiver needs were:

- Support in managing fears about the patient’s condition.
- Receiving disease-related information.
- Receiving emotional support for themselves.

There were no strong predictors of caregiver needs. However, unmet patient needs and caregiver anxiety were modestly associated with unmet needs in caregivers.

Similarly, the SCNS–P&C was administered to 166 lung cancer patient–caregiver dyads in Taiwan.[[8](#cit/section_2.8)] The top unmet needs were information needs.

**Caregiver tasks:** A cross-sectional study demonstrated that assisting patients in activities of daily living (ADLs) increased caregiver burden.[[9](#cit/section_2.9)] This study enrolled 100 caregivers of older adults (age >65 years) with cancer. The caregivers were mostly women, married to and living with the patients. Employment status and participation in ADLs were risk factors for increased burden on multivariate analysis. Similarly, a survey of 590 caregivers showed that primary caregivers assumed a significant workload.[[10](#cit/section_2.10)] As a consequence, they experienced challenges in maintaining employment and social relations, and had financial difficulties. On the other hand, primary caregivers experienced the most personal growth through their experiences. A subsequent systematic review supported the results of the two studies.[[11](#cit/section_2.11)] A more nuanced view is that the perceived burden and psychological consequences may relate to the sense of mastery for any given caregiver task.[[12](#cit/section_2.12)]

### Secondary Appraisal: Resources for Informal Caregivers

This list captures the resources that caregivers identified in multiple studies as important:

- Recognition by health care providers of the informal caregivers’ roles, responsibilities, and challenges.
- Information about treatment plans, goals, anticipated complications or side effects, and likely outcomes.
- Guidance for how to respond to changes in patients’ physical and emotional health over the disease trajectory.
- Support in coping with the stress of caregiving (for which they are most often unprepared and untrained).
- Detailed education about medical and nursing tasks they are expected to perform, such as giving injections, providing wound care, and managing side effects.

### Potential Moderators of Caregiver Burden

Factors associated with increased caregiver burden include the following:

- Female gender.
- Age (younger or older with impaired health status).
- Race and ethnicity.
- Lower socioeconomic status.
- Employment status.
- Role strain.
- Site of care.
- Patient characteristics (e.g., level of anxiety, depression, functional status, and quality of life [QOL]).[[13](#cit/section_2.13)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

#### Female gender

Female gender is an established risk factor for increased burden.[[14](#cit/section_2.14),[15](#cit/section_2.15)][[Level of evidence: II]](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English) A survey of 308 self-identified caregivers of patients with advanced cancer sought to characterize potential determinants of the increased burden for female caregivers.[[16](#cit/section_2.16)] Results demonstrated that hope and perceived fulfillment of support needs were the most significant protective factors against burden for any gender. Women who were employed or who used emotion-focused coping were more likely to perceive burden. These results suggest that interventions to address role strain and alternative coping strategies may be useful.

#### Age

Family caregivers often feel unprepared, have inadequate knowledge, and receive little guidance from the oncology team for caring for a cancer patient.[[17](#cit/section_2.17)] Older caregivers are especially vulnerable because they may present with comorbidities, be living on fixed incomes, and have reduced social support networks. In addition, older caregivers of cancer patients may neglect their own health needs, have less time to exercise, forget to take their own prescription medications, and become fatigued from interrupted sleep. It is common for older caregivers to have poor physical health, depression, and even increased mortality.[[18](#cit/section_2.18),[19](#cit/section_2.19)]

Younger caregivers generally juggle work, family responsibilities, and sacrifices involving their social lives. Middle-aged caregivers typically worry about missed workdays, interruptions at work, taking leaves of absence, and reduced productivity.[[20](#cit/section_2.20),[21](#cit/section_2.21)]

#### Race and ethnicity

Differences among racial and ethnic groups in caregiver time commitment, levels of support and resources, and attitudes have been noted. In a meta-analysis of 116 empirical studies, Asian American caregivers provided more caregiving hours than White, African American, and Hispanic caregivers; used lower levels of formal support services; and had fewer financial resources, lower levels of education, and higher levels of depression than other groups.[[22](#cit/section_2.22)] These findings are important for the oncology team because caregivers with no outside help are more depressed than are those who receive help.

A study involving unmet needs and service barriers among Asian American caregivers found that caregivers refused outside help because they “felt too proud to accept it” or “didn’t want outsiders coming in.” Other barriers included “bureaucracy too complex” or “can’t find qualified providers.”[[23](#cit/section_2.23)] A study of hospice use by Asian American patients found that family reluctance to discuss a patient's health status among themselves resulted in lower rates of hospice enrollment. This reluctance was rooted in the belief that talking about death or dying is bad luck, which could complicate discussions about prognosis and informed consent.[[24](#cit/section_2.24)] Keeping a cancer diagnosis secret from a patient and avoiding discussions about disease progression can add to a caregiver’s sense of burden and responsibility.

Similarly, Hispanic and African American patients and caregivers underutilize community health resources, including counseling and support groups, home care, residential care, and hospice services. Strong family ties may prevent these caregivers from seeking help outside of the family unit.[[25](#cit/section_2.25)] A study that compared African American, White, and Hispanic caregivers found that 75% of Hispanic patients and 60% of African American patients lived with the family of the primary caregiver. The racial and ethnic minority families relied more on informal caregiving from friends and relatives and had larger social support networks than the White families. However, this increased sense of obligation to care for older family members was associated with more caregiving hours, greater resignation about caregiving, higher levels of caregiver strain, and a larger reduction in household income compared with White caregivers.[[25](#cit/section_2.25),[26](#cit/section_2.26)] For more information, see the [Disparities in Hospice Utilization](/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/hospice-hp-pdq#_437) section in Hospice.

Another study analyzed reports of employment loss due to caregiving responsibilities. Results showed that African American and Hispanic caregivers were more likely than White caregivers to reduce their work hours to care for patients. In addition, African American and Hispanic caregivers were reluctant to use formal nursing home services for their loved ones. The decision to reduce work hours rather than place a relative in a nursing home was associated with increased psychological, social, and financial burden.[[27](#cit/section_2.27)]

#### Socioeconomic status

Substantial out-of-pocket costs related to caregiving can create financial strain for the families of patients with cancer. Low personal and household incomes and limited financial resources may also place families at risk of treatment noncompliance or making treatment-related decisions based on income.[[28](#cit/section_2.28)]

Investigators assessed caregiver burden in 414 caregivers of older patients with advanced cancer in a secondary analysis of longitudinal data (at baseline, 4–6 weeks, and 3 months) collected during the Improving Communication in Older Cancer Patients and their Caregivers trial.[[29](#cit/section_2.29)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The authors used the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, which includes five subscales measuring domains of caregiving burden: self-esteem, disrupted schedule, financial problems, lack of family support, and health problems. Also assessed was caregivers' rurality, defining rural residence as living in 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes other than 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 4.1, 5.1, 7.1, 8.1, or 10.1. In the analysis, rural residence was significantly associated with more disrupted schedules, financial problems, and lack of social support among caregivers with a high school education or less.

#### Employment status

Informal caregiving is known to impose economic burdens on families. One study analyzed data from 458 cancer survivors who responded to the U.S. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Experiences with Cancer
Survivorship Survey (ECSS) and from 4,706 cancer survivors who responded to the LIVESTRONG 2012 Survey for People Affected by Cancer (SPAC). Results demonstrated that 25% of those responding to the MEPS ECSS and 29% of those responding to the SPAC reported that their caregivers made extended employment changes, including taking paid or unpaid time off and making changes in hours, duties, or employment status.[[30](#cit/section_2.30)] The work productivity of 70 caregivers of patients with advanced cancer showed a 23% decline because of missed work.[[31](#cit/section_2.31)] More hours of caregiving were associated with greater loss in productivity, which was associated with higher rates of caregiver depression and anxiety. In a study of 89 caregivers of advanced-cancer patients, 69% of caregivers reported some form of adverse impact on work. This portion increased to 77% during the end-of-life period.[[32](#cit/section_2.32)]

Some research has shown an incremental increase in the economic burden of caregiving, assessed from disease and demographic characteristics. A study of 78 caregivers of women with advanced breast cancer showed that loss of productivity (absenteeism and reduced productivity at work) was greater for caregivers of women with progressive disease than for caregivers of those who were free of disease.[[33](#cit/section_2.33)] A survey of 1,629 caregivers of people with lung and colorectal cancers demonstrated that economic burden was highest for caregivers of individuals with lung cancer or stage IV disease.[[34](#cit/section_2.34)] In a study of 54 caregivers, African American and Hispanic caregivers reported greater distress related to employment and finances than White caregivers.[[35](#cit/section_2.35)] A study of partner caregivers of men with prostate cancer showed that caregivers with lower incomes (<$40,000/year) spent more time on informal caregiving than those with higher incomes.[[36](#cit/section_2.36)]

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 was designed to give employees the option of taking time off from work for their own serious medical condition or that of a relative without losing their jobs or benefits.[[37](#cit/section_2.37)] Family members are entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks’ leave under the law.

#### Role strain

Role strain is experienced when the perceived rights, duties, and behaviors of one socially defined role (e.g., employee) conflict with the rights, duties, and behaviors of a different role (e.g., student). The multiple roles performed by caregivers of cancer patients can compete for caregivers’ physical and emotional resources. A study of 457 middle-aged caregivers showed that the more social roles a caregiver performed, the more likely the caregiver was to experience stress and negative affect.[[38](#cit/section_2.38)] In a population-based study of 1,234 adult-child and spousal caregivers of patients with lung or colorectal cancer, caregiver employment was associated with higher social/emotional caregiver burden.[[39](#cit/section_2.39)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] It is important to recognize, however, that employed caregivers may benefit from the respite provided by work and from the support of employers and coworkers, which enable them to replenish their psychological resources.[[38](#cit/section_2.38)] Thus, multiple roles do not always engender strain.

#### Site of care

Cancer care is provided in multiple locations that vary in their ability to provide support services for caregivers. Thus, site of care may be considered a risk factor for caregiver burden. This claim is further supported by the results of a qualitative interview study of 12 patients and 12 caregivers about the challenges faced in transitioning from hospital to home.[[40](#cit/section_2.40)] The investigators identified four salient themes:

- Ongoing concerns related to disease and its treatment.
- Needing timely help.
- Resuming control and normality.
- Appreciating the care transition.

An independent study of dyads demonstrated that the transition to home is stressful because of the need to deal with symptoms, and uncertainty about prognosis and disease progression.[[41](#cit/section_2.41)] Increased caregiver burden caused by transitions in sites of care should be recognized and ameliorated, when possible, with home nursing visits.

Unplanned changes in sites of care, such as hospital readmission, also place increased demands on caregivers. A total of 129 dyads of older adults with cancer and their family caregivers were studied to determine factors for unplanned hospital admissions.[[42](#cit/section_2.42)] Investigators found that severity of symptoms, rather than caregiver knowledge—a target of many interventions—predicted unplanned hospital admissions in older adults with cancer during the active treatment. These results suggest that symptom management interventions may reduce stressful events more than increasing caregiver knowledge about symptoms.

#### Patient characteristics

Patient characteristics may also influence caregiver burden. In a cross-sectional study of 441 older patient-caregiver dyads with advanced cancer, patients with higher levels of anxiety and depression, worse functional status, and poorer QOL were associated with increased reports of caregiver burden, regardless of time spent caregiving.[[13](#cit/section_2.13)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Similarly, in a cross-sectional study of 172 dyads of patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers, caregivers of patients admitted to an acute palliative care unit reported worse stress burden and mental health than caregivers of patients receiving outpatient supportive care.[[43](#cit/section_2.43)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Coping Strategies and Self-Efficacy

As conceptualized, coping strategies mediate the relationship between positive or negative consequences and the perception that the demands of caregiving exceed the available resources. One group of investigators interviewed and surveyed 50 family caregivers of cancer patients receiving palliative care.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The aim was to describe the relationships between coping strategies and anxiety in caregivers. Anxiety was common in caregivers (76%). Emotion-based coping was associated with less anxiety, while dysfunctional coping was associated with increased anxiety. Perceived burden was also associated with increased anxiety.

As shown in the [Transactional Model of Stress and Coping](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_242), caregivers and patients are interconnected. Evidence demonstrates a link between patient coping style and caregiver adjustment. A cross-sectional study of baseline data from a trial of subspecialty palliative care confirmed the relationship in 275 family caregivers of patients with incurable lung or colorectal cancer.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] The investigators demonstrated that caregivers experienced greater depressive symptoms when patients used emotional support coping or expressed optimism about their prognosis. Among patients, less use of emotional support coping was associated with greater caregiver anxiety.

This interconnectedness between caregiver and patient also involves threat appraisal (the first step in the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping). A study of 484 dyads demonstrated that patient and caregiver symptom distress influenced their own, and in some cases each other’s, cognitive appraisals.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)]

## Assessment of Caregivers

Caregiver assessment can be performed at any point of contact within the health care system. Ideally, a comprehensive caregiver assessment should be performed when the following occurs:[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

- The patient is first diagnosed with cancer.
- The patient presents in the emergency department.
- A major transition is planned.

In systems where caregivers are assessed, practitioners can acknowledge caregivers as valued members of the health care team. Caregiver assessment can identify family members most at risk of developing physical and mental health difficulties, so that additional services can be planned accordingly.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

Multiple instruments to measure caregiver burden are available, including the Zarit Burden Interview,[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] among others.[[3](#cit/section_4.3)-[10](#cit/section_4.10)] Objective measures of caregiver burden comprise variables such as the number of hours spent providing care and a count of tasks the caregiver performs.[[11](#cit/section_4.11)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)][[12](#cit/section_4.12)] Objective measures are usually short and easy to answer, often pointing to a clear direction for problem solving and direct intervention.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)] Caregiver assessment should reflect culturally competent practices.[[14](#cit/section_4.14)]

Although there are many tools for measuring caregiver burden, a review [[15](#cit/section_4.15)] found only eight tools in English for the psychometric evaluation of cancer caregivers. Of the eight, the Caregiver Reaction Assessment and Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer had the best psychometric performance. Additionally, 16 conceptual domains within five overarching themes were identified across the eight instruments. Although the tools showed overlap in several domains, no single tool measured all domains. In assessing caregiver burden, it is prudent to use two or more instruments to obtain an evaluation across all domains.

## The Needs of Caregivers During the Cancer Trajectory

The cancer experience can be viewed in several distinct phases, from screening to diagnosis to treatment to either long-term survivorship or the end of life.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] The phases differ in likely activities, goals, and outcomes for the patient. It seems reasonable to assume that the experiences of the caregiver also vary, given the interdependence of caregiver and patient.

### Studies Comparing Caregivers at Different Points in the Cancer Trajectory

Few studies directly compare caregivers of cancer patients across the disease trajectory or patients at different stages of disease.
One research group conducted a qualitative study and interviewed 15 cancer caregivers before, during, and 4 months after bone marrow transplant. Although the exemplars varied across the trajectory, two consistent themes emerged: caregivers' uncertainty and the need for more information.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

Another study compared the results of two cross-sectional studies of caregivers of cancer patients who were in the late palliative phase or were attending a pain clinic (which the authors termed the curative phase).[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] The authors found no differences in the mean scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale or the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey as measures of quality of life (QOL). The results should be interpreted with caution, given the different inclusion criteria and different time periods of the study. Furthermore, the group means may obscure meaningful changes in individual caregivers over time.

A separate analysis demonstrated that symptom burdens in patients did not vary between cohorts, but both groups scored high on measures of weakness and fatigue.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)] Caregivers reported higher rates of depression when patients had insomnia, but the association did not vary between cohorts. However, the methodology of the studies limits the drawing of firm conclusions.

In a cross-sectional study of 1,580 caregivers of patients with different cancer types, caregivers of patients undergoing active treatment had a significantly lower mean score on the Distress Thermometer than caregivers of patients in follow-up.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Mean scores on another measure of caregiver distress, the Caregiver Risk Screen, were not significantly different across groups. Conversely, caregivers of patients undergoing active treatment reported significantly worse QOL on the Caregiver Quality of Life Index–Cancer than caregivers of patients in follow-up. One possible explanation for these findings is that while patients’ physical and practical needs may decrease after treatment, caregivers may experience heightened uncertainty and fear of cancer recurrence during survivorship.[[6](#cit/section_5.6),[7](#cit/section_5.7)]

### Survivorship

The evidence demonstrates that although the prevalence of unmet needs diminishes over time, many caregivers continue to experience needs related to the cancer experience during the survivorship phase.

For example, a longitudinal study was designed to track the psychosocial, financial, and occupational impact of having ongoing needs as a caregiver in Australia.[[8](#cit/section_5.8)] The investigators analyzed responses to the Supportive Care Needs Survey—Partners and Caregivers (SCNS–P&C) from 547 caregivers at 6 months, 519 caregivers at 12 months, and 443 caregivers at 24 months after the cancer diagnosis. Of note, 444 of the original 547 participants completed surveys at 12 months, and 372 completed surveys at 24 months.

Several findings deserve emphasis:

- The proportion of caregivers reporting any unmet need decreased from 50.2% at 6 months to 30.7% at 24 months.
- A similar decline was seen for caregivers who reported at least five or ten unmet needs, although the baseline prevalence was lower.
- The most pressing unmet needs were related to concerns about cancer recurrence, reducing stress in the survivor’s life, and understanding the survivor’s experience.
- Unmet needs were negatively associated with caregivers’ well-being (although not uniformly).

In a longitudinal study of 120 dyads of patients with hepatobiliary or pancreatic cancer and their caregivers, at diagnosis 25% of caregivers reported high levels of chronic depressive symptoms, and 21% had high levels of stress.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Levels of depressive symptoms and stress at diagnosis remained high up to 18 months postdiagnosis, while those with low to moderate levels of depressive symptoms and stress at diagnosis saw those levels decline over time. Patient depressive symptoms also predicted caregiver stress. These findings suggest that caregivers with higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress at diagnosis may be the most vulnerable over time, but further research is needed in more diverse samples, as most caregivers were women (85%). Similarly, a 2021 study found that in 111 caregivers of newly diagnosed cancer patients, poorer caregiver QOL was associated with higher levels of caregiver depression, anxiety, and stress, and that caregiver QOL and levels of social support changed over the treatment trajectory.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### End of Life

The end-of-life experiences of patients with advanced cancer influence the burden on caregivers and their eventual psychological adjustment during bereavement. A longitudinal study of caregivers of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer provides valuable insights into the caregiver’s experience in the last year of the patient’s life.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)] Ninety-nine caregivers completed measures every 3 months for 2 years. The caregivers reported lower-than-expected mental and physical QOL. The average distress level and number of unmet needs increased over time. Perceived social support did not change. Caregiver distress was predicted by lower optimism, higher unmet needs, and shortened time to patient death. Patient QOL was not a predictor. In the last 6 months of the patient’s life, managing emotions about poor prognosis and balancing work with caregiving demands were related to high unmet needs among caregivers.

One potential source of caregiver distress toward the end of life is the ambiguity around caregivers' role in decisions to limit potentially life-sustaining treatments such as chemotherapy or resuscitation. Two studies provide clarifying observations.[[12](#cit/section_5.12),[13](#cit/section_5.13)] One study embedded researchers during hospitalizations of patients with advanced cancer to record the participation of caregivers in decisions to limit treatment.[[12](#cit/section_5.12)] The investigators identified 70 patients, but only 63 had caregivers present. In the cohort, only 32% of relatives were involved, both positively and negatively. Clinicians were more often aware of patients’ preferences when relatives were present (78% vs. 29%, *P* = .014). However, caregivers did not always agree with patients and, in one-third of the observations, contradicted the patients. Thus, caregivers may be a source of insight but do not necessarily accurately reflect patients’ wishes.

The caregiver’s importance to the decision-making process may vary based on clinicians’ attitudes. In an interview study of oncology physicians and nurses, two broad perspectives were found: maintaining patient autonomy independent of caregiver influence and facilitating decision-making by actively involving caregivers seeking consensus.[[13](#cit/section_5.13)] These perspectives were based on a desire to enhance the positive aspects of caregivers’ support (e.g., emotional, encouragement to plan, and understanding of information) while minimizing the potential barriers (e.g., family reluctance to accept the patient is at the end of life, the need to mediate conflicts, and the increased time required to include caregivers). These findings highlight the potential value of caregivers and the need to develop specific strategies for including them in end-of-life discussions.

Hospice care can provide critical support to caregivers as well as patients. One group of investigators compared the burden and QOL of caregivers of patients with advanced cancer who were receiving active treatment with the burden and QOL of caregivers of patients who were receiving hospice care.[[14](#cit/section_5.14)] The goal was to characterize the demands unique to the hospice phase of care. The investigators found no difference in the perceived burden of caregiving and increased role limitations due to mental or emotional challenges. However, caregivers in the hospice group reported fewer physical limitations. Similarly, another group reported that longer hospice stays were associated with better patient QOL and better caregiver adjustment during bereavement.[[15](#cit/section_5.15)]

A potential explanation for the benefit of hospice is that caregivers are reassured by the higher quality of end-of-life care and the honoring of patients’ goals. One study analyzed interviews with 1,146 family members of Medicare beneficiaries who died of advanced-stage lung or colorectal cancer.[[16](#cit/section_5.16)] The results demonstrated that hospice enrollment was associated with more “excellent” ratings for quality of care reported by family members. Similarly, patients who received intensive care or had short hospice enrollments were less frequently reported to have died in their preferred place.[[17](#cit/section_5.17)] For more information, see [Hospice](/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/hospice-hp-pdq).

Caregivers may also require support to effectively participate in decisions about whether to provide patients with artificial nutrition or hydration (ANH). Investigators conducted a prospective cross-sectional survey of 39 patients with advanced cancer and 30 relatives about their views on ANH.[[18](#cit/section_5.18)] Only 24% of relatives stated they would opt out of ANH if deciding on behalf of their loved ones, and 48% were against hydration. Patients were less concerned than their relatives about adverse physical symptoms such as pain, agitation, and hunger. Patients endorsed their family members’ opinions as important in these decisions. For more information, see the [Artificial Hydration](/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq#_205) section in Last Days of Life.

## Interventions to Prevent, Reduce, or Ameliorate Caregiver Burden

Many types of interventions have been tested to address the needs of informal caregivers.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[3](#cit/section_6.3)] The interventions have focused on improving outcomes for the individual patient, caregiver, or patient-caregiver dyad.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]
The types of interventions and their goals include the following:

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT):** To use psychoeducational and social interventions to reduce caregiver burden and feelings of distress.
- **Complementary and alternative medicine therapies:** To reduce caregiver distress and burden through guided imagery, reflexology, reminiscence therapy, massage therapy, and healing touch.
- **Family/couples therapy:** To improve the functioning of the couple and family unit.
- **Interpersonal therapy:** To provide individual counseling to reduce the psychological consequences of caregiving burdens.
- **Problem solving and skill building:** To develop caregiving skills, including the ability to assess and manage patients’ symptoms, identify solutions to caregiving problems, and enhance caregivers’ ability to cope with cancer caregiving roles and responsibilities.
- **Psychoeducational:** To address the information needs of cancer caregivers, including information related to diagnosis, prognosis, coping, self-care, home care, impact on partners and family, and hospital care or follow-up and rehabilitation.[[4](#cit/section_6.4)]
- **Subspecialty palliative care:** To directly address caregivers’ concerns and improve their outcomes by improving patient outcomes.
- **Supportive therapy:** To address the emotional needs of informal caregivers.

The efficacy of these interventions has been mixed. Findings from a few meta-analyses have identified small to medium positive effects of psychosocial-educational interventions on caregivers and on patient-caregiver outcomes.[[5](#cit/section_6.5)-[7](#cit/section_6.7)] However, many studies are limited by small sample sizes and short assessments, and outcomes often vary depending on the study focus (patient vs. caregiver vs. patient-caregiver dyads).[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]

### Meta-analyses

One meta-analysis of 29 randomized clinical trials published from 1983 to 2009 [[6](#cit/section_6.6)] identified the following three major types of interventions:

- Psychoeducational.
- Skill building/problem solving.
- Therapeutic counseling.

The authors used a conceptual framework to organize the outcome data, integrating stress and coping theory, CBT, and quality of life (QOL) frameworks. Overall, all three interventions showed small to moderate effects for improving the following outcomes:

- **Caregiver burden** (11 studies; overall effect size, Hedge's g [g] = 0.22).
- **Caregivers’ ability to cope** (10 studies; overall effect size, g = 0.47 within the first 3 months, which remained significant 3 to 6 months later [overall effect size, g = 0.20] and 6 months later [g = 0.35]).
- **Self-efficacy** (8 studies; overall effect size, g = 0.25, which remained significant at 3 to 6 months’ follow-up [g = 0.20] and beyond).
- **Aspects of QOL,** including physical functioning (7 studies; g = 0.22 at 3 to 6 months’ follow-up and g = 0.26 at 6 months’ follow-up), distress and anxiety (16 studies; g = 0.20 during the first 3 months), and marital/family relationships (10 studies; g = 0.20). There was no significant improvement in depression or social functioning.

A follow-up systematic review of the literature identified 49 intervention studies that addressed caregiver demands and burden.[[3](#cit/section_6.3)] Eight different types of interventions were noted, with most studies categorized as psychoeducational, problem solving, supportive therapy, and family and couples therapy. The authors noted only three studies that used CBT. However, all three studies using CBT noted significant improvement in psychological functioning in informal caregivers. Overall, programs that were structured, integrative, and goal oriented appeared to offer the greatest benefits.[[3](#cit/section_6.3)]

This initial work was expanded upon with a synthesis and meta-analyses of the effectiveness of CBT for improving psychological functioning in informal caregivers.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)] The authors identified a small statistical effect of CBT (g = 0.08). However, this effect disappeared when randomized controlled trials were reviewed alone. The authors suggested that the broad definition of CBT and variations in the definition of informal caregivers may have limited results.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)]

Two additional reviews focused on literature published up until 2016.[[8](#cit/section_6.8),[9](#cit/section_6.9)] One group of investigators conducted a systematic review of 21 psychosocial interventions for improving QOL, depression, and anxiety in cancer caregivers.[[8](#cit/section_6.8)] This report and others have illustrated some noteworthy interventions used in multiple studies.

- **Psychoeducational intervention:** The FOCUS Program is an informational and support program that includes five core content areas: **F**amily involvement, **O**ptimistic attitude, **C**oping effectiveness, **U**ncertainty reduction, and **S**ymptom management. This intervention has shown improvement in caregiver QOL in multiple randomized controlled trials.[[10](#cit/section_6.10),[11](#cit/section_6.11)]
- **Problem-solving intervention:** COPE (**C**reativity, **O**ptimism, **P**lanning, **E**xpert Information) is a problem-solving model, used by multiple investigators, that has shown improvement in caregiver QOL,[[12](#cit/section_6.12),[13](#cit/section_6.13)] burden of patient symptoms, and caregiving task burden.[[12](#cit/section_6.12)] This program has also been used in combination with other cognitive behavioral trials with some success.[[14](#cit/section_6.14)]
- **Psychoeducational and supportive therapy:** CHESS (**C**omprehensive **H**ealth **E**nhancement **S**upport **S**ystem) is a web-based lung cancer information, communication, and coaching system for caregivers.[[15](#cit/section_6.15)] This program was tested in 285 informal caregivers of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Caregivers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The comparison group received
standard care plus a laptop computer with Internet access (if
needed) and a list of lung cancer and palliative care websites. The treatment group received standard care plus a laptop computer and
Internet access (if needed) and access to the CHESS lung cancer
website, “Coping with Lung Cancer: A Network of Support.” Caregivers assigned to CHESS had small to moderate but significant effects in improved caregiver burden and negative mood. This study is a good example of using the Web to reach informal caregivers, who often cannot attend supportive training programs in person.

### Individual Studies

A few individual landmark studies have examined interventions for informal caregivers of people with cancer.

#### Overview of study limitations and unresolved questions

A number of limitations in studies to date prevent any conclusions about choosing an optimal intervention. Salient limitations include the following:

- The variation in intervention delivery across studies, from in-person sessions to telephone, online, or web-based applications.
- The lack of consensus regarding the definition of informal caregivers and types of interventions, making comparisons across studies difficult.
- The potential lack of scalability of interventions studied in a limited number of sites, leaving the unanswered question of how to provide interventions to rural populations and those with transportation concerns.
- The frequent lack of a match between the primary outcome measure and the target of the intervention. For example, interventions focused on problem solving often failed to assess improvement in the capacity to solve problems but instead measured more distal outcomes such as psychological adjustment. Such studies raise questions about attributing intervention effects.
- The unrecognized variations in the levels of caregiver burden or distress among study participants. Researchers noted that informal caregivers who were most distressed were more likely to decline to enroll in a trial or, if enrolled, often failed to complete the intervention, which affected the evaluation. In addition, investigators have suggested that efficacy has varied because of low baseline levels of caregiver burden and distress or inadequate follow-up, resulting in the inability to identify changes in levels of distress.

These limitations can be addressed in future studies:

- Use consensus definitions for informal caregivers and interventional categories.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)]
- Identify more-vulnerable caregiving populations (e.g., socially isolated caregivers, rural residents, older people, members of lower socioeconomic groups, and people with the most complicated care and needs).[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]
- Incorporate risk stratification to target highly stressed informal caregivers and patients.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] Future studies may focus on those most in need to adequately demonstrate intervention effectiveness.
- Incorporate technology not only to improve interventions but also to improve access to interventional support.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]

#### Overview of results of selected studies

The following two tables contain brief descriptions of noteworthy reports to aid in understanding potential interventions and benefits. [Table 1](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_142) organizes studies by type of intervention and highlights positive and negative studies. As [outlined](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_91) in the previous section, however, methodological limitations prevent comparisons or conclusions.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]

## Interventions for Caregivers During the Cancer Trajectory

### Subspecialty Palliative Care

As previously described in this summary, the mental and physical health and coping of patients and caregivers are interdependent. Several trials of subspecialty palliative care interventions have specifically targeted and measured caregiver outcomes. For more information, see the sections on [Secondary Appraisal: Resources for Informal Caregivers](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_196), [The Needs of Caregivers During the Cancer Trajectory](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_44), and [The Psychological Consequences of Caregiving](/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq#_155).

- **Educate, Nurture, Advise Before Life Ends (ENABLE):** First developed for patients with advanced cancer,[[1](#cit/section_7.1)] in 2015 this intervention was expanded to include informal caregivers and improve selected outcomes. The ENABLE III intervention included three weekly structured telephone coaching sessions, monthly follow-up, and a bereavement call. It was delivered along with the COPE (**C**reativity, **O**ptimism, **P**lanning, **E**xpert Information) problem-solving program. [[2](#cit/section_7.2)] It was tested in 122 informal caregivers, with 61 receiving early intervention and 61 receiving delayed intervention (3 months later). Informal caregivers who received early intervention had better outcomes than caregivers who received delayed intervention. These outcomes included lower depression scores at 3 months and lower depression and stress burden in terminal analyses of decedents’ caregivers.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)]
- **Early integrated palliative care in advanced-stage lung and gastrointestinal cancer:** Patients and caregivers randomly assigned to the intervention arm were scheduled to meet monthly with either a subspecialty palliative care physician or an advanced-practice provider.[[4](#cit/section_7.4)] One hundred thirty-seven caregivers were assigned to early palliative care and 138 to usual care. Caregivers were invited but not required to attend. The median number of visits attended by a caregiver (not necessarily the enrolled caregiver) was 10, with a range of 1 to 51. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was administered at weeks 12 and 24. Caregivers assigned to the palliative care arm had fewer symptoms of depression at 12 weeks but not at 24 weeks. There were no differences in anxiety scores.
- **Early palliative care for patients with advanced cancer:** Ninety-four caregivers were randomly assigned to the intervention, which included palliative care office visits (which were not mandatory for the caregiver) and nurse phone contact the week after each monthly visit. Home visits were available. The median number of visits attended was two, with a range of zero to eight; 85% of caregivers attended at least one visit. Caregivers in the palliative care arm were more satisfied with care than caregivers in the usual-care arm, but there was no improvement in caregiver quality of life (QOL).[[5](#cit/section_7.5)]
- **Palliative care and hematopoietic stem cell transplant:** A trial of the effect of inpatient subspecialty palliative care visits during hospitalization for stem cell transplant demonstrated that caregivers of intervention patients experienced a smaller increase in depression than caregivers of control patients. But there were no differences in QOL or anxiety.[[6](#cit/section_7.6)] The intervention did not specifically focus on caregivers. Instead, the focus was on the patient’s physical and psychological symptoms.

### Palliative Care and End of Life

A systematic review highlighted the results of 14 studies of patients receiving end-of-life care. The review showed that cognitive behavioral therapy was conducted the most (n = 6) and demonstrated the most positive outcomes, including increased self-efficacy, improved psychological functioning, increased hope, and improved QOL across the various studies.[[7](#cit/section_7.7)]

## Parents as Caregivers

The diagnosis of childhood cancer represents the start of a period of substantial distress for parents. These parents report shock, emotional pain, difficulty coping with the necessary procedures performed on their child, rumination, and high levels of information seeking accompanied by a sense of lack of control.[[1](#cit/section_8.1)-[3](#cit/section_8.3)] One study evaluated 119 mothers and 52 fathers of children undergoing cancer treatment. The study found that all but one participant reported traumatic stress symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, physiological arousal, and avoidance.[[4](#cit/section_8.4)] In another study, parents of children undergoing treatment (n = 175) were compared with parents of children who had completed treatment (n = 238). Parents reported symptoms of traumatic stress (such as intrusion and arousal) more frequently during the acute phase of treatment than after treatment. Certain demographic factors may play a role in the degree to which parents experience significant stress that impairs function. Mothers were more likely than fathers to report higher levels of stress, and parents with fewer years of formal education and lower socioeconomic status were more likely to experience traumatic stress at any time.[[5](#cit/section_8.5)]

Patterns of parental stress in families of children treated for cancer differ from those in families of children treated for other diseases. In one large study of 675 parents, parents of children with cancer reported significantly higher levels of distress—as indicated by anxiety, physical and psychological distress, depression, and loneliness—than did parents of children with diabetes. Distress levels of the two groups of parents matched in measures of uncertainty, loss of control, self-esteem, disease-related fear, and sleep disturbances. Distress levels for parents of children with cancer decreased in intensity with longer time since diagnosis.[[6](#cit/section_8.6)]

At the same time they are dealing with increased distress, parents of children with cancer report wanting to remain strong and optimistic for their children.[[7](#cit/section_8.7)] One study found no differences in multiple measures of family distress and psychological functioning between families of children with cancer and families with healthy children.[[8](#cit/section_8.8)]

Several factors appear to predict long-term parental adjustment. Better short- and long-term adjustment is experienced by parents who:[[9](#cit/section_8.9)-[11](#cit/section_8.11)]

- Are employed.
- Have social support from family, friends, and health care team members.
- Experience lower levels of parenting stress.
- View their children’s quality of life positively.
- Have positive expectations for treatment outcome.

Factors associated with poorer parental adjustment include:[[12](#cit/section_8.12),[13](#cit/section_8.13)]

- Low parental expectations for positive outcomes.
- Feelings of helplessness, uncertainty, and anxiety.
- Low levels of social support.
- Negative interactions with health care team members.
- Negative assessment of the child’s quality of life.

Race [[14](#cit/section_8.14)] and parent gender [[15](#cit/section_8.15)] may affect the intensity of the effect of these factors on parental functioning. In rare circumstances, the stress of coping with pain, adverse side effects, lack of control or understanding of information or outcomes, and conflicts with health care professionals may lead parents to drop out of cancer treatment for their children.[[16](#cit/section_8.16)]

Most studies suggest that over time, maternal affective distress and perceived stress decline, but the perceived burden of caring for a child with cancer remains stable, as do positive characteristics such as parental control, nurturance, and responsiveness.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)] This pattern may be related to the high levels of social support provided at the time of diagnosis. Over all phases of cancer treatment, the level of support gradually declines, while the perceived quality of support remains stable.[[15](#cit/section_8.15)] In general, parents are seen as resilient,[[12](#cit/section_8.12)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] but parental loneliness and continued uncertainty may last far beyond the treatment phase if there are ongoing late effects of treatment for the child.[[17](#cit/section_8.17)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] A few studies have found that a substantial number of parents (30%–36%) of long-term cancer survivors may experience intense, long-term, stress-related symptoms that fall below the threshold for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but that are nevertheless a significant problem for these parents.[[18](#cit/section_8.18),[19](#cit/section_8.19)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Symptoms were severe enough that in 20% of families, at least one parent met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.[[19](#cit/section_8.19)]

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/supportive-care) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
