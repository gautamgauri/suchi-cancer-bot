## General Information About Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

### Incidence and Mortality

Most tumors of the paranasal sinuses present with advanced disease,
and cure rates are generally poor (≤50%). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequent
type of malignant tumor in the nose and paranasal sinuses (70%–80%).
Papillomas are distinct entities that may undergo malignant degeneration. The
cancers grow within the bony confines of the sinuses and are often asymptomatic
until they erode and invade adjacent structures.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)-[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

Nodal involvement is
infrequent. Metastases from both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses may occur, and distant metastases are found in 20% to 40% of
patients who do not respond to treatment. However, locoregional recurrence accounts for most cancer deaths because most patients die of direct extension into vital areas of the skull or of
rapidly recurring local disease.

Cancers of the maxillary sinus are the most common of the paranasal sinus
cancers. Tumors of the ethmoid sinuses, nasal vestibule, and nasal cavity are
less common, and tumors of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are rare.

### Anatomy

The major lymphatic drainage route of the maxillary antrum is through the
lateral and inferior collecting trunks to the first station submandibular,
parotid, and jugulodigastric nodes and through the superoposterior trunk to
retropharyngeal and jugular nodes.

### Clinical Evaluation and Follow-Up

Pretreatment evaluation and staging, as well as the need for
multidisciplinary planning of treatment, is very important. Generally, the
first opportunity to treat patients with head and neck cancers is the most
effective, although salvage surgery or salvage radiation therapy,
as appropriate, may occasionally be successful.

Because most treatment failures occur
within 2 years, patients must be monitored frequently and meticulously
during this period. Lifetime follow-up is essential because nearly 33% of these patients
develop second primary cancers in the aerodigestive tract.

### Carcinogenesis and Risk Factors

Data indicate that various industrial exposures may be related to cancer
of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity. The risk of a second primary head and
neck tumor is considerably increased.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)] A study has shown that a subgroup of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity SCCs are associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and that HPV-positive patients may have a better prognosis than those who are HPV negative.[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

## Cellular Classification of Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

The most common cell type for paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers is
squamous cell carcinoma. Minor salivary gland tumors comprise 10% to 15% of
these neoplasms. Malignant melanoma presents in less than 1% of neoplasms in
this region. Some 5% of cases are malignant lymphomas.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

Esthesioneuroepithelioma, sometimes confused with undifferentiated carcinoma or
undifferentiated lymphoma, arises from the olfactory nerves.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and most soft tissue sarcomas
have been reported for this region.

Inverting papilloma is considered a low-grade benign tumor with a tendency to
recur and, in a small percentage of cases, to transform into a malignant tumor.

Midline granuloma, a progressively destructive condition, also involves this region.

## Stage Information for Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

The staging systems are clinical estimates of the extent of disease. The
assessment of the tumor is based on inspection, palpation, and direct endoscopy
when necessary. The tumor must be confirmed histologically, and any other
pathological data obtained on biopsy may be included. The appropriate nodal
drainage areas are examined by careful palpation. Computed tomographic and/or
magnetic resonance imaging studies are generally required to adequately
evaluate tumor extent before surgical resection or definitive
radiation therapy. If a patient's disease relapses, complete restaging must be done to select the appropriate additional therapy.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

### American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions

Staging for nasal cavity and paranasal sinus carcinomas is not as well
established as staging for other head and neck tumors. For cancer of the maxillary sinus, the nasal cavity, and the ethmoid sinus, the
AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification. Lymphomas, sarcomas, and mucosal melanomas of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity are not staged using this system.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] The staging described below is used only for patients who have not had a lymph node dissection of the neck.

## Treatment Option Overview for Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

Except for patients with T1 mucosal carcinomas, the accepted method of treatment is a
combination of radiation therapy and surgery. The incidence of lymph node
metastases is generally low (approximately 20% of cases). Thus, routine
radical neck dissection or elective neck radiation therapy is recommended only for
patients presenting with positive nodes.

For patients with operable tumors,
radical surgery is generally performed first to remove the bulk of the tumor
and to establish drainage of the affected sinus(es). This is followed by
postoperative radiation therapy. Some institutions continue to give a full
dose of radiation therapy preoperatively for all patients with stage II and stage III tumors and
operate 4 to 6 weeks later.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[3](#cit/section_4.3)] A review of published clinical results of
radical radiation therapy for head and neck cancer suggested a significant loss
of local control with prolonged radiation therapy;
therefore, lengthening of standard treatment schedules should be avoided
whenever possible.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

### Surgery

Surgical exploration may be required to determine operability.

Relative contraindications to surgery include destruction of
the base of the skull (i.e., anterior cranial fossa), cavernous sinus, or the pterygoid
process; infiltration of the mucous membranes of the nasopharynx; or
nonresectable lymph node metastases.
Surgical approaches include fenestration with removal of the bulk tumor, which
is usually followed by radiation therapy or block resection of the upper jaw.
A combined craniofacial approach, including resection of the floor of the
anterior cranial fossa, has been used with success in selected patients.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)] Removal of
the eye is performed if the orbit is extensively invaded by cancer. Clinically
positive nodes, if resectable, may be treated with radical neck dissection.

### Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy must be carried to high doses for any significant probability
of permanent control. The treatment volume must include all of the maxillary
antrum and involved hemiparanasal sinus and contiguous areas. The orbit and
its contents are excluded except under unusual circumstances. Lymph nodes of
the neck, when palpable, should be treated in conjunction with treatment of
advanced carcinomas of the antrum. This may be unnecessary for early tumors.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a high incidence (>30%–40%) of
hypothyroidism in patients who have received external-beam radiation therapy to the
entire thyroid gland or to the pituitary gland. Thyroid function testing of
patients should be considered prior to therapy and as part of posttreatment
follow-up.[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[7](#cit/section_4.7)]

### Recurrent Disease

Patients with recurrent disease should consider chemotherapy clinical trials.
Chemotherapy for recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck has been
shown to be efficacious as palliation and may improve a patient's quality of life and
length of survival. Various drug combinations, including cisplatin,
fluorouracil, and methotrexate, are effective.[[8](#cit/section_4.8),[9](#cit/section_4.9)]

Treatment of tumors of the paranasal sinuses and of the nasal cavity should be
planned on an individual basis because of the complexity involved.

#### Fluorouracil dosing

The *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[10](#cit/section_4.10),[11](#cit/section_4.11)] Patients with the *DPYD\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)-[12](#cit/section_4.12)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)-[15](#cit/section_4.15)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)]

## Treatment of Stage I Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

Stage I disease includes small lesions.

### Maxillary Sinus Tumors

Maxillary sinus tumors are small lesions of the infrastructure.

Treatment options for stage I maxillary sinus tumors include the following:

1. Surgical resection.
2. Postoperative radiation therapy should be considered for close margins
(particularly in tumors of the suprastructure).

### Ethmoid Sinus Tumors

Ethmoid sinus tumors are usually extensive when diagnosed.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[3](#cit/section_5.3)]

Treatment options for stage I ethmoid sinus tumors include the following:

1. External-beam radiation therapy alone is generally used for
unresectable lesions.
2. Well-localized lesions can be resected, but resection of the ethmoids, maxilla, and orbit, with consideration for
a craniofacial approach, is generally required.
3. If surgery can be done with good functional and cosmetic results,
postoperative radiation therapy should be given even with clear
surgical margins.

### Sphenoid Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for stage I sphenoid sinus tumors include the following:

1. Treatment is the same as for nasopharyngeal cancers, primarily
radiation therapy. For more information, see the [Treatment of Stage I Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/nasopharyngeal-treatment-pdq#_54) section in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment.

### Nasal Cavity Tumors

For nasal cavity tumors (squamous cell carcinomas), treatment preferences
are either surgery or radiation therapy, which have equal cure rates.

Treatment options for stage I nasal cavity tumors include the following:

1. Surgery for tumors of the septum.
2. Radiation therapy for tumors of the lateral and superior walls.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)]
3. Surgery plus radiation therapy for tumors of the septal and lateral
walls.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)]

surgery is preferred, provided that no deformity is expected and a need
for reconstruction is not anticipated. Radiation therapy is preferred
for other small lesions.[[6](#cit/section_5.6),[7](#cit/section_5.7)] Treatment of the ipsilateral neck should be considered.

## Treatment of Stage IV Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

Stage IV disease includes advanced lesions.

### Maxillary Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for stage IV maxillary sinus tumors include the following:

1. High-dose radiation therapy is used because extension to the base of the skull and nasopharynx is
a potential, but not absolute, contraindication to surgery. If radiation therapy is to be used alone, localized
drainage of the sinus(es) must be established before radiation
therapy treatments are initiated.
2. Superfractionated radiation therapy (under clinical evaluation).[[1](#cit/section_8.1)]
3. Clinical trials for advanced tumors should be
considered to evaluate chemotherapy preoperatively or before radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy after surgery or after combined-modality therapy should also be considered.
4. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered.

### Ethmoid Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for stage IV ethmoid sinus tumors include the following:

1. Generally, a craniofacial resection in combination with preoperative or
postoperative radiation therapy is performed.[[2](#cit/section_8.2)-[4](#cit/section_8.4)]
2. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered for patients with inoperable tumors.
3. Clinical trials for advanced tumors should be
considered to evaluate chemotherapy preoperatively or before radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy after surgery or after combined-modality therapy should also be considered.

### Sphenoid Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for stage IV sphenoid sinus tumors include the following:

1. Treatment is the same as for nasopharyngeal cancers, primarily
radiation therapy.
For more information, see the [Treatment of Stages II, III, and IV Nonmetastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/nasopharyngeal-treatment-pdq#_70) and [Treatment of Metastatic and Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/nasopharyngeal-treatment-pdq#_80) sections in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment.
2. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered.

### Nasal Cavity Tumors

3. Radiation therapy or radical surgery may eventually be necessary.

### Melanomas and Sarcomas

Treatment options for stage IV melanomas and sarcomas include the following:

1. Surgical excision if possible.
2. Appropriate radiation therapy and various chemotherapy agents should be
considered.

### Midline Granulomas

Treatment options for stage IV midline granulomas include the following:

1. Radiation therapy to nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.

### Nasal Vestibule Tumors

Treatment options for stage IV nasal vestibule tumors include the following:

1. Generally, radiation therapy is preferred to minimize deformity. External-beam (i.e., photons or electrons) and/or interstitial implantation can be
used. Surgery is reserved for salvage. Treatment of the neck should
be considered.
2. Clinical trials for advanced tumors should be
considered to evaluate chemotherapy preoperatively or before radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy after surgery or after combined-modality therapy should also be considered.
3. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy as used in clinical trials has been used to shrink
tumors and to render them more definitively treatable with either surgery
or radiation therapy. This chemotherapy is given before the other modalities; therefore,
the designation of *neoadjuvant* is used to distinguish it from standard adjuvant therapy,
which is given after or during definitive therapy with radiation or after
surgery. Many drug combinations have been used in neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.[[6](#cit/section_8.6)-[8](#cit/section_8.8)]

## Treatment of Recurrent Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer

Chemotherapy for recurrent head and neck squamous cell cancer has shown
promise. Chemotherapy may be indicated when there is recurrence in either
distant or local disease after primary surgery or radiation therapy, and when there is
residual disease after primary treatment.[[1](#cit/section_9.1),[2](#cit/section_9.2)] Survival may be improved in
those achieving a complete response to chemotherapy.[[3](#cit/section_9.3)] Combined-modality
therapy with platinum and radiation therapy has been used in clinical trials such as UMCC-8810.[[4](#cit/section_9.4)]

### Maxillary Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for recurrent maxillary sinus tumors include the following:

1. After surgery, radiation therapy or craniofacial resection with
postoperative radiation therapy.
2. After radiation therapy, craniofacial resection if indicated.
3. Chemotherapy should be considered for patients with disease that does not respond to other treatments.
4. Clinical trials using chemotherapy should be
considered.[[5](#cit/section_9.5),[6](#cit/section_9.6)]

### Ethmoid Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for recurrent ethmoid sinus tumors include the following:

1. After limited surgery, craniofacial resection, radiation therapy, or
both.[[7](#cit/section_9.7)-[9](#cit/section_9.9)]
2. After radiation therapy, craniofacial resection.
3. Chemotherapy should be considered for patients with disease that does not respond to other treatments.
4. Clinical trials using chemotherapy should be
considered.[[5](#cit/section_9.5),[6](#cit/section_9.6)]

### Sphenoid Sinus Tumors

Treatment options for recurrent sphenoid sinus tumors include the following:

1. Treatment is the same as for nasopharyngeal cancers, primarily
radiation therapy. For more information, see the [Treatment of Metastatic and Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/nasopharyngeal-treatment-pdq#_80) section in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment.
2. Chemotherapy should be considered for patients with disease that does not respond to other treatments.

### Nasal Cavity Tumors

For nasal cavity tumors (squamous cell carcinomas), salvage is possible in
approximately 25% of patients.

Treatment options for recurrent nasal cavity tumors include the following:

1. For disease that does not respond to radiation therapy, craniofacial resection.
2. For disease that does not respond to surgery, radiation therapy.
3. Chemotherapy should be considered for patients with disease that does not respond to radiation therapy or surgery.
4. Clinical trials using chemotherapy should be
considered.[[5](#cit/section_9.5),[6](#cit/section_9.6)]

### Inverting Papillomas

Treatment options for recurrent inverting papillomas include the following:

1. Surgical excision.
2. Re-excision for surgery failures.
3. Radical surgery or radiation therapy may eventually be necessary.

### Melanomas and Sarcomas

Treatment options for recurrent melanomas and sarcomas include the following:

1. Surgical excision if possible.
2. Appropriate chemotherapy geared specifically to cell type. For more information, see the [Treatment of Metastatic and Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/nasopharyngeal-treatment-pdq#_80) section in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment and the [Treatment of Recurrent Major Salivary Gland Cancer](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/salivary-gland-treatment-pdq#_96) section in Salivary Gland Cancer Treatment.

### Midline Granulomas

Treatment options for recurrent midline granulomas include the following:

1. Radiation therapy to nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.

### Nasal Vestibule Tumors

Treatment options for recurrent nasal vestibule tumors include the following:

1. For disease that does not respond to radiation therapy, surgery.
2. For disease that does not respond to surgery, radiation therapy or a combination of surgery and
radiation therapy.
3. Chemotherapy should be considered for patients with disease that does not respond to radiation therapy or surgery.
4. Clinical trials using chemotherapy should be
considered.[[5](#cit/section_9.5),[6](#cit/section_9.6)]

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. [General information](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials") about clinical trials is also available.
