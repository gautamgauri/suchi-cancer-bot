# PDQ® Health Professional Cancer Information - NCI

# PDQ® Cancer Information Summaries for Health Professionals

The PDQ health professional cancer information summaries are part of the **comprehensive, evidence-based, up-to-date** cancer content made available as a public service of the NCI. The summaries are written by Editorial Boards of cancer experts and provide the strength of the evidence for specific interventions. The summaries are fully referenced with links to published literature.

As a public service that is fully funded by the US government, PDQ health professional cancer information summaries are freely available to US and International audiences through publication on NCI’s website. Most of the health professional summaries are also available in a patient-focused format. The summaries are also made available to other organizations for translation and reuse through the [NCI content syndication program](/syndication).

In addition to English, almost all summaries are available in Spanish from NCI, and selected content is available in Chinese and Japanese from content partners. Learn more about [PDQ® in Other Languages](/publications/pdq/other-languages).

The PDQ health professional cancer information summaries were established in response to legislative mandates originally contained in the National Cancer Act of 1971. They are not clinical practice guidelines or treatment recommendations and are not intended to be used as a basis for insurance reimbursement.
