**NOTE: There is either no new research on this topic or the recent published research is weak and not appropriate for inclusion in the summary. Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only.**

This [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information summary provides an overview of
the use of [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a treatment
for people with cancer. The summary includes a brief history of cartilage research, the
results of [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and
possible [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cartilage use.

This summary contains the following key information:

- Bovine (cow) cartilage and shark cartilage have been studied as
treatments for people with cancer and other medical conditions for more than 30
years.
- Numerous cartilage products are sold commercially in the United States
as [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Three principal mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the
[antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential of cartilage: (1) it kills cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) directly; (2) it
stimulates the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); and (3) it blocks the formation of new [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
([angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), which [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) need
for unrestricted growth.
- At least three different inhibitors of angiogenesis have been identified
in bovine cartilage, and two [angiogenesis inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46739&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
have been purified from shark cartilage.
- Few human studies of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer have been reported, and the results
are inconclusive.
- Additional [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer are now being conducted.

## General Information

Bovine (cow) [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and shark cartilage have been investigated as treatments
for people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [psoriasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44219&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [arthritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44188&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a number of other medical
conditions for more than 30 years.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)-[19](#cit/section_2.19)] At least some of
the interest in cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer arose from the mistaken
belief that sharks, whose [skeletons](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44221&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are
made primarily of cartilage, are not affected by this disease.[[16](#cit/section_2.16),[20](#cit/section_2.20),[21](#cit/section_2.21)] Although reports of [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
tumors in sharks are rare, a variety of cancers have been detected in these
animals.[[20](#cit/section_2.20)-[23](#cit/section_2.23)] Nonetheless, several substances that have
antitumor activity have been identified in cartilage.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)-[4](#cit/section_2.4),[7](#cit/section_2.7),[15](#cit/section_2.15)-[19](#cit/section_2.19),[24](#cit/section_2.24)-[49](#cit/section_2.49)] More than half a dozen [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cartilage as a
treatment for people with cancer have already been conducted.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)-[4](#cit/section_2.4),[6](#cit/section_2.6)-[9](#cit/section_2.9),[15](#cit/section_2.15)-[18](#cit/section_2.18),[49](#cit/section_2.49),[50](#cit/section_2.50)] Additional clinical studies, [MDA-ID-99303](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005838) and [AETERNA-AE-MM-00-02](/clinicaltrials/NCT00022282) have been completed.[[6](#cit/section_2.6),[15](#cit/section_2.15),[50](#cit/section_2.50)]

The absence of [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in cartilage led to the [hypothesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44209&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that cartilage [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (also
known as [chondrocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44191&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) produce one
or more substances that inhibit blood vessel formation.[[27](#cit/section_2.27)-[30](#cit/section_2.30),[35](#cit/section_2.35),[36](#cit/section_2.36),[48](#cit/section_2.48)] The formation of new blood vessels or [angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is
necessary for [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to grow larger than a few [millimeters](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44215&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [diameter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44224&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., larger than approximately
100,000 to 1,000,000 cells) because tumors, like normal tissues, must obtain
most of their oxygen and nutrients from blood.[[33](#cit/section_2.33),[34](#cit/section_2.34),[41](#cit/section_2.41),[51](#cit/section_2.51)-[54](#cit/section_2.54)] A
developing tumor, therefore, cannot continue to grow unless it establishes
connections to the [circulatory
system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44194&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of its host. It has been reported that tumors can initiate the
process of angiogenesis when they contain as few as 100 cells.[[53](#cit/section_2.53)] Inhibition
of angiogenesis at this early [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may,
in some instances, lead to complete tumor [regression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[53](#cit/section_2.53)] The possibility that
cartilage could be a source of one or more types of [angiogenesis inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46739&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
for the treatment of cancer has prompted much research.

The major structural components of cartilage include several types of the
[protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [collagen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44196&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and several types of
[glycosaminoglycans](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44206&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are
[polysaccharides](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44162&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[19](#cit/section_2.19),[29](#cit/section_2.29),[30](#cit/section_2.30),[39](#cit/section_2.39),[48](#cit/section_2.48),[54](#cit/section_2.54),[55](#cit/section_2.55)] [Chondroitin sulfate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44192&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is the
major glycosaminoglycan in cartilage.[[39](#cit/section_2.39),[54](#cit/section_2.54)] Although there is no
evidence that the collagens in cartilage, or their breakdown products, can
inhibit angiogenesis, there is evidence that shark cartilage contains at least
one angiogenesis inhibitor that has a glycosaminoglycan component (refer to the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_23) section of this summary for more information).[[46](#cit/section_2.46)] Other data indicate that
most of the [antiangiogenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44186&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
activity in cartilage is not associated with the major structural components.[[26](#cit/section_2.26),[30](#cit/section_2.30),[48](#cit/section_2.48)]

Some glycosaminoglycans in cartilage reportedly have [anti-inflammatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44187&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [immune-system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-stimulating properties,[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2),[14](#cit/section_2.14),[16](#cit/section_2.16),[56](#cit/section_2.56),[57](#cit/section_2.57)] and it has been
suggested that either they or some of their breakdown products are toxic to
tumor cells.[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3),[24](#cit/section_2.24)] Thus, the antitumor potential of cartilage
may involve more than one mechanism of action.

Cartilage products are sold commercially in the United States as [dietary
supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). More than 40 different brand names of shark cartilage alone are
available to consumers.[[17](#cit/section_2.17)] In the United States, dietary
supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. Therefore, premarket
evaluation and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not
required unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made.
Because manufacturers of cartilage products are not required to show evidence
of anticancer or other biologic effects, it is unclear whether
any of these products have [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential. In addition,
individual products may vary considerably from lot to lot because standard
manufacturing processes do not exist, and [binding agents](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44189&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [fillers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44205&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be added during
production.[[17](#cit/section_2.17)] The FDA has not approved the use of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer or any other medical condition. The FDA is notifying consumers of a refund program for purchasers of Lane Labs-USA, Inc.'s shark cartilage product, BeneFin. Consumers are eligible for a partial refund of the purchase price and any shipping and handling costs if this product was purchased between September 22, 1999 and July 12, 2004.

To conduct clinical drug research in the United States, researchers must
file an [Investigational](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44763&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. IND
status has been granted to at least four groups of [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to study
cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer; one of these trials, MDA-ID-99303, is now completed.[[7](#cit/section_2.7),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[58](#cit/section_2.58)] Because the
IND application process is confidential and because the existence of an IND
can be disclosed only by the applicants, it is not known whether other
applications have been made.

In [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), cartilage products have been administered in a variety
of ways. In some studies, [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
administration of either liquid or powdered forms has been
used.[[19](#cit/section_2.19),[39](#cit/section_2.39),[40](#cit/section_2.40),[43](#cit/section_2.43),[44](#cit/section_2.44),[59](#cit/section_2.59),[15](#cit/section_2.15),[47](#cit/section_2.47)] In other studies, cartilage
products have been given by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [intraperitoneal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), applied [topically](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or placed in slow-release
plastic pellets that were [surgically](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) implanted.[[26](#cit/section_2.26)-[28](#cit/section_2.28),[32](#cit/section_2.32),[33](#cit/section_2.33),[35](#cit/section_2.35),[38](#cit/section_2.38),[40](#cit/section_2.40),[42](#cit/section_2.42),[44](#cit/section_2.44),[46](#cit/section_2.46),[48](#cit/section_2.48)] Most of the latter studies investigated the effects of
cartilage products on the development of blood vessels in the [chorioallantoic membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44193&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
of chicken [embryos](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44202&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the [cornea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44199&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of rabbits, or the [conjunctiva](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44197&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
mice.[[26](#cit/section_2.26)-[28](#cit/section_2.28),[32](#cit/section_2.32),[35](#cit/section_2.35),[38](#cit/section_2.38),[40](#cit/section_2.40),[42](#cit/section_2.42),[44](#cit/section_2.44),[46](#cit/section_2.46),[48](#cit/section_2.48)]

In human studies (MDA-ID-99303, AETERNA-AE-MM-00-02, and [NCCTG-971151](/clinicaltrials/NCT00026117)), cartilage products have been administered topically or
orally, or they have been given by [enema](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44204&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
or [subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
injection.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)-[4](#cit/section_2.4),[6](#cit/section_2.6)-[9](#cit/section_2.9),[15](#cit/section_2.15),[16](#cit/section_2.16),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[60](#cit/section_2.60)] For oral
administration, liquid, powdered, and pill forms have been
used as described in the following completed trials: MDA-ID-99303, NCCTG-971151, [AETERNA-AE-RC-99-02](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005995), and AETERNA-AE-MM-00-02.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)-[4](#cit/section_2.4),[6](#cit/section_2.6)-[9](#cit/section_2.9),[15](#cit/section_2.15),[16](#cit/section_2.16),[18](#cit/section_2.18)] The [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and duration of
cartilage treatment have varied in human studies, in part because different
types of products have been tested.

In this summary, the brand name (i.e., registered or trademarked name) of
the cartilage product(s) used in individual studies will be identified
wherever possible.

## History

The [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential of [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been investigated for more than
30 years. As noted previously (refer to the [General Information](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_5) section of this summary for more information),
cartilage products have been tested as treatments for people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [psoriasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44219&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and
[arthritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44188&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cartilage products have also been studied as enhancers of [wound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441269&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
repair and as treatments for people with [osteoporosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [ulcerative colitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45493&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [regional enteritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44220&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [acne](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44183&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [scleroderma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44142&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [hemorrhoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44207&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), severe [anal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44185&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) itching, and the [dermatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45667&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by poison oak and
poison ivy.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[5](#cit/section_3.5)]

Early [studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cartilage’s therapeutic potential utilized extracts of bovine
(cow) cartilage. The ability of these extracts to suppress [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was first described in
the early 1960s.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The first report that bovine cartilage contains at least
one [angiogenesis inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46739&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was published in the mid-1970s.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)] The use of
bovine cartilage extracts to treat patients with cancer and the ability of
these extracts to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) directly and to stimulate animal [immune
systems](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were first described in the mid- to late-1980s.[[7](#cit/section_3.7)-[10](#cit/section_3.10)]

The first report that shark cartilage contains at least one angiogenesis inhibitor was published in the early 1980s,[[11](#cit/section_3.11)] and the only
published report of a clinical trial of shark cartilage as a treatment
for people with cancer appeared in the late 1990s.[[12](#cit/section_3.12)] The more recent interest in shark
cartilage is due, in part, to the greater abundance of cartilage in this
animal and its apparently higher level of [antiangiogenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44186&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity. Approximately 6% of the body weight of a shark is composed of cartilage,
compared with less than 1% of the body weight of a cow.[[13](#cit/section_3.13)] In
addition, on a weight-for-weight basis, shark
cartilage contains approximately 1,000 times more antiangiogenic activity than bovine
cartilage.[[11](#cit/section_3.11)]

As indicated previously (refer to the [Overview](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_1) and [General Information](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_5) sections of this summary for more information), at
least three different mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the
anticancer potential of cartilage: 1) it is [toxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to cancer cells; 2) it
stimulates the immune system; and 3) it inhibits [angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Only
limited evidence is available to support the first two mechanisms of action; however, the
evidence in favor of the third mechanism is more substantial (refer to the
[Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_23) section of this summary for more information).

The process of angiogenesis requires at least four coordinated steps, each
of which may be a target for inhibition. First, [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) must communicate with
the [endothelial cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that line
the inside of nearby [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This communication takes place, in part,
through the secretion of angiogenesis factors such as [vascular endothelial growth factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44222&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[14](#cit/section_3.14)-[18](#cit/section_3.18)] Second,
the activated endothelial cells must divide to produce new endothelial
cells, which will be used to make the new blood vessels.[[15](#cit/section_3.15),[17](#cit/section_3.17)-[20](#cit/section_3.20)] Third, the dividing endothelial cells must migrate toward the
tumor.[[15](#cit/section_3.15)-[20](#cit/section_3.20)] To accomplish this, they must produce [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [matrix metalloproteinases](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44211&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
which will help them carve a pathway through the tissue elements that separate
them from the tumor.[[18](#cit/section_3.18)-[22](#cit/section_3.22)] Fourth, the new endothelial cells
must form the hollow tubes that will become the new blood vessels.[[17](#cit/section_3.17),[18](#cit/section_3.18)] Some angiogenesis inhibitors may be able to
block more than one step in this process.

Cartilage is relatively resistant to invasion
by tumor cells,[[23](#cit/section_3.23)-[30](#cit/section_3.30)] and tumor cells use
matrix metalloproteinases when they migrate during the process of [metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[21](#cit/section_3.21),[25](#cit/section_3.25),[31](#cit/section_3.31),[32](#cit/section_3.32)] Therefore, if the angiogenesis inhibitors in cartilage are also inhibitors of
matrix metalloproteinases, then the same [molecules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be able to block both
angiogenesis and metastasis. Shark tissues other
than cartilage have also been reported to produce [antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substances.[[33](#cit/section_3.33)-[36](#cit/section_3.36)]

## Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies

The [antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential of [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been investigated extensively in
[laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some of these studies have assessed the
toxicity of cartilage products toward [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)*.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

### Powdered Cartilage Products

In one study, cells from 22 freshly isolated human [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (nine [ovary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
three [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), two brain, two [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and one each of [sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45562&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [cervix](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46133&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [testis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367406&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and three human [cultured cell lines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44016&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([breast
cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [colon cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [myeloma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45795&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) were
treated with Catrix, which is a commercially available powdered preparation of
bovine (cow) cartilage.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[3](#cit/section_4.3),[4](#cit/section_4.4)] In the study, the growth of all
three cultured cell lines and cells from approximately 70% of the tumor
specimens were inhibited by 50% or more when Catrix was used at high
concentrations (1–5 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/[mL](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of culture fluid). However, it is
unclear whether the inhibitory effect of Catrix in this study was
specific to the growth of cancer cells because the preparation’s effect on the growth of
normal cells was not tested. In addition, the [cytotoxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) component of Catrix has
not been identified, and it has not been shown that equivalent inhibitory
concentrations of this component can be achieved in the bloodstreams of
patients who may be treated with either [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) formulations of this
product. (Refer to the [Human/Clinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_36) section of this summary for more information.)

A commercially available preparation of powdered shark
cartilage (no brand name given) was reported to have no effect on the growth
of human [astrocytoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45602&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells *in
vitro*.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] The shark cartilage product tested in this study, however, was examined at
only one concentration (0.75 mg/mL).[[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

The [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)–stimulating potential of cartilage has also been
investigated in laboratory and animal studies.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)] In one study,
Catrix was shown to stimulate the production of [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by mouse [B cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (B [lymphocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45765&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) both *in vitro* and *[in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)*. However, increased antibody
production *in vivo* was observed only when Catrix was administered by [intraperitoneal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
or [intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection. It was not observed when oral formulations of
Catrix were used.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)] In most experiments, the
proliferation of mouse B cells (i.e., normal, [nonmalignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44217&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells) *in vitro* was
increasingly inhibited as the concentration of Catrix was increased (tested
concentration range, 1–20 mg/mL). Catrix has also been
reported to stimulate the activity of mouse [macrophages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44054&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) *in vivo*,[[3](#cit/section_4.3)]
but results demonstrating this effect have not been published.

The effects of shark cartilage on the immune system were also reported in two studies that used the same purified protein fraction that had exhibited the most immunostimulatory effects when tested.[[7](#cit/section_4.7),[8](#cit/section_4.8)] One study explored the effects of this fraction on tumor immune response by observing the infiltration of this fraction on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in a murine tumor model. An increase in the ratio of CD4/CD8 lymphocytes was seen in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)] The second study exploring immune system response measured antibody response, cytotoxic assay, lymphocyte transformation, and intratumor T-cell ratio in mice. The fraction exhibited the ability to augment delayed-type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells in mice and to decrease the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells. In addition, this fraction showed a strong inhibitory effect on human brain microvascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration in the fibrin matrix.[[7](#cit/section_4.7)]

Additional *in vivo* studies of the antitumor potential of shark cartilage
have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)-[11](#cit/section_4.11)] In
one study, oral administration of powdered shark cartilage (no brand name
given) was shown to inhibit chemically induced angiogenesis in the [mesenteric membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44212&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
rats.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)] In another study, oral administration of powdered shark cartilage
(no brand name given) was shown to reduce the growth of GS-9L
[gliosarcomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45701&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in rats.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)] It was reported in a third study that oral administration of two powdered shark cartilage products, Sharkilage and MIA Shark Powder, did not
inhibit the growth or the metastasis of SCCVII [squamous cell carcinomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in
mice.[[11](#cit/section_4.11)]

A large number of laboratory and animal studies concerning the [antiangiogenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44186&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential of cartilage have been published.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[9](#cit/section_4.9),[12](#cit/section_4.12)-[32](#cit/section_4.32)] Overall, these studies have revealed the presence of at least three [angiogenesis inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46739&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in bovine cartilage [[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16)-[18](#cit/section_4.18),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[23](#cit/section_4.23),[33](#cit/section_4.33)] and at least two in shark cartilage.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[9](#cit/section_4.9),[25](#cit/section_4.25),[26](#cit/section_4.26)]

### Aqueous Extracts of Cartilage

A liquid (i.e., [aqueous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43998&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) extract of
shark cartilage called AE-941/Neovastat has also been reported to inhibit
the growth of a variety of cancer cell types *in vitro*.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)]
These results have not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal and are not consistent with other results obtained by the same group of [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[27](#cit/section_4.27),[34](#cit/section_4.34)]

Three angiogenesis inhibitors in bovine cartilage have been very well
characterized.[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16)-[18](#cit/section_4.18),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[23](#cit/section_4.23),[33](#cit/section_4.33)] They are relatively
small [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [molecular
masses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44216&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that range from 23,000 to 28,000.[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16),[23](#cit/section_4.23)] These
proteins, called cartilage-derived inhibitor (CDI), cartilage-derived
antitumor factor (CATF), and cartilage-derived [collagenase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44249&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) inhibitor (CDCI) by the
researchers who purified them,[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[21](#cit/section_4.21)] have been shown to block [endothelial
cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) proliferation *in vitro* and new [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) formation in the
[chorioallantoic membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44193&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of chicken [embryos](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44202&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16)-[18](#cit/section_4.18),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[23](#cit/section_4.23),[33](#cit/section_4.33)] Two of the proteins (CDI and CDCI) have been shown to inhibit [matrix
metalloproteinase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44211&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity *in vitro*,[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16),[18](#cit/section_4.18)] and one (CDI)
has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell migration *in vitro*.[[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16)] These proteins do not block the proliferation of normal cells or of tumor
cells *in vitro*.[[14](#cit/section_4.14),[16](#cit/section_4.16),[17](#cit/section_4.17),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[33](#cit/section_4.33)] When the [amino acid sequences](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44184&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of CDI,
CATF, and CDCI were determined, it was discovered that they were the same as
those of proteins known otherwise as tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), chondromodulin I, and TIMP-2, respectively.[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[18](#cit/section_4.18),[23](#cit/section_4.23),[33](#cit/section_4.33)]

A possible fourth angiogenesis inhibitor in bovine cartilage has been
purified not from cartilage but from the culture fluid of bovine [chondrocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44191&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
grown in the laboratory.[[15](#cit/section_4.15)] This inhibitor, which has been named
chondrocyte-derived inhibitor (ChDI), is a protein that has a molecular mass
of approximately 36,000. It has been reported that ChDI and CDI/TIMP-1
have similar antiangiogenic activities,[[15](#cit/section_4.15),[16](#cit/section_4.16),[33](#cit/section_4.33)] but the
relationship between these proteins is unclear because amino acid sequence
information for ChDI is not available. Thus, whether CDI/TIMP-1 is a
breakdown product of ChDI or whether ChDI is truly the fourth angiogenesis
inhibitor identified in bovine cartilage is unknown.

As indicated previously, shark cartilage, like bovine cartilage, contains
more than one type of angiogenesis inhibitor. One shark cartilage inhibitor,
named U-995, reportedly contains two small proteins, one with a molecular mass
of approximately 14,000 and the other with a molecular mass of approximately
10,000.[[25](#cit/section_4.25)] Both proteins have shown antiangiogenic activity when tested
individually. The exact relationship between these two proteins and their relationship to the larger bovine angiogenesis inhibitors are not
known because amino acid sequence information for U-995 is not available.
U-995 has been reported to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, endothelial
cell migration, matrix metalloproteinase activity *in vitro*, and the
formation of new blood vessels in the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken
embryos.[[25](#cit/section_4.25)] It does not appear to inhibit the proliferation of other types
of normal cells or of cancer cells *in vitro*. Intraperitoneal but not
oral administration of U-995 has been shown to inhibit the growth of mouse
sarcoma-180 tumors implanted [subcutaneously](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the backs of mice and the
formation of [lung metastases](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45315&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of mouse B16-F10 melanoma cells injected into the
tail veins of mice.[[25](#cit/section_4.25)]

The second angiogenesis inhibitor identified in shark cartilage appears to
have been studied independently by three groups of investigators.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[26](#cit/section_4.26),[35](#cit/section_4.35)]
This inhibitor, which was named SCF2 by one of the groups,[[35](#cit/section_4.35)] is a
[proteoglycan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44218&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that has a molecular
mass of about 10,000. Proteoglycans are combinations of
[glycosaminoglycans](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44206&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and protein.[[30](#cit/section_4.30)] The principal
glycosaminoglycan in SCF2 is [keratan
sulfate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44210&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[35](#cit/section_4.35)] SCF2 has been shown to block endothelial cell proliferation
*in vitro*,[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[26](#cit/section_4.26),[35](#cit/section_4.35)] the formation of new blood vessels in the chorioallantoic
membrane of chicken embryos,[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[26](#cit/section_4.26)] and tumor-induced angiogenesis in the
[corneas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44199&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of rabbits.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[26](#cit/section_4.26)]

Other studies have demonstrated that AE-941/Neovastat, the previously
mentioned aqueous extract of shark cartilage, has antiangiogenic activity,[[12](#cit/section_4.12),[27](#cit/section_4.27),[28](#cit/section_4.28),[34](#cit/section_4.34),[36](#cit/section_4.36)-[39](#cit/section_4.39)] but the molecular basis for this activity has not been
defined. Therefore, whether AE-941/Neovastat contains U-995 and/or SCF2 or
some other angiogenesis inhibitor is not known. It has been reported that
AE-941/Neovastat inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and matrix
metalloproteinase activity *in vitro* and the formation of new blood vessels in
the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos.[[12](#cit/section_4.12),[27](#cit/section_4.27),[31](#cit/section_4.31)] In addition, AE-941/Neovastat has been shown to induce endothelial cell [apoptosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46524&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by activating caspases, [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) important in the promotion and regulation of apoptosis.[[32](#cit/section_4.32),[34](#cit/section_4.34),[38](#cit/section_4.38)] It
also appears to inhibit the action of [vascular endothelial growth factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44222&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), thus
interfering with the communication between tumor cells and nearby blood
vessels.[[28](#cit/section_4.28),[34](#cit/section_4.34),[37](#cit/section_4.37),[38](#cit/section_4.38)] AE-941/Neovastat may also inhibit angiogenesis through promotion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. Neovastat stimulates tPA expression in endothelial cells through an increase in the transcription of the tPA gene.[[40](#cit/section_4.40)] This transcriptional activation is associated with activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways to an extent similar to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).[[40](#cit/section_4.40)] Furthermore, AE-941/Neovastat has been reported to inhibit the growth of
DA3 [mammary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44560&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [adenocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells and the
[metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of Lewis lung [carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45963&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
cells *in vivo* in mice.[[5](#cit/section_4.5),[27](#cit/section_4.27),[34](#cit/section_4.34),[41](#cit/section_4.41)] In the Lewis lung
carcinoma experiments, AE-941/Neovastat enhanced the [antimetastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effect of the [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) drug [cisplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45230&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[5](#cit/section_4.5),[27](#cit/section_4.27),[34](#cit/section_4.34),[41](#cit/section_4.41)] All the aspects of preclinical development have been reviewed.[[42](#cit/section_4.42)]

The cartilage-derived antiangiogenic substance troponin I (TnI) has been isolated from human cartilage and has been produced by the cloning and expression of cDNA of human cartilage. It has been shown to specifically inhibit angiogenesis *in vivo* and *in vitro* and tumor metastasis *in vivo*.[[43](#cit/section_4.43)] The active site of Tnl has been located in the amino acid residues of 96 to 116. The synthetic peptide Glu94-Leu123 (pTnl) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell tube formation and endothelial cell division and to inhibit pancreatic cancer metastases in an *in vivo* liver metastases model.[[44](#cit/section_4.44)]

## Human/Clinical Studies

Since the early 1970s, at least a dozen clinical trials ([MDA-ID-99303](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005838), [NCCTG-971151](/clinicaltrials/NCT00026117), and [AETERNA-AE-MM-00-02](/clinicaltrials/NCT00022282)) of [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a treatment for people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been (or are being) conducted;[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[15](#cit/section_5.15)] (refer to the [table](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_82) at the end of this section) however, results
from only seven studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[8](#cit/section_5.8),[9](#cit/section_5.9),[16](#cit/section_5.16)] It is not clear whether any of the patients in these
studies were children.

In the first randomized trial published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, 83 incurable [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients were randomly assigned to receive either shark cartilage or [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), in addition to standard care. No difference was observed in survival or [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) between those receiving shark cartilage and those receiving placebo.[[8](#cit/section_5.8)] Additional clinical studies are under way; however, the cumulative
evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of cartilage as a
treatment for people with cancer.

### Powdered Cartilage Products

Two of the three published clinical studies evaluated the use of Catrix,
the previously mentioned (refer to the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_23) section of this summary for more information)
powdered preparation of bovine (cow) cartilage, as a treatment for various [solid
tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45301&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2)] One of these studies was a [case series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44006&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that included 31
patients;[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] the other was a [phase II clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45831&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
included 9 patients.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

In the case series,[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] all patients were treated with [subcutaneously](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
[injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) Catrix; however, three patients (one with [squamous cell
carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the skin and two with [basal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46515&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the
skin) were also treated with [topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) preparations. The individual [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
the total dose, and the duration of Catrix treatment in this series varied
from patient to patient; however, the minimum treatment duration was 7 months,
and the maximum duration was more than 10 years. Eighteen patients had been
treated with [conventional therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44198&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [radiation
therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [hormonal therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46367&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov))
within 1 year of the start of Catrix treatment; nine patients received
conventional therapy concurrently with Catrix treatment;
and seven patients received conventional therapy both prior to and during
Catrix treatment. It was reported that 19 patients had a [complete response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), 10 patients
had a [partial response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45819&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and 1 patient had [stable disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45884&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
following Catrix treatment. The remaining patient did not respond to
cartilage therapy. Eight of the patients with a complete response received no
prior or concurrent conventional therapy. Approximately half of the patients
with a complete response eventually experienced [recurrent cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

This clinical study had several weaknesses that could have affected its
outcome, including the absence of a [control group](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the receipt of
prior and/or concurrent conventional therapy by most patients.

Partial results of a third clinical study of Catrix are described in an
abstract submitted for presentation at a scientific conference,[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] but
complete results of this study have not been published in a peer-reviewed
scientific journal. In the study, 35 patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma were divided into four groups, and the individuals in each group
were treated with identical doses of subcutaneously injected and/or oral
Catrix. Three partial responses and no complete responses were observed among
22 [evaluable patients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44029&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who
were treated with Catrix for more than 3 months. Following Catrix therapy, 2 of the 22 evaluable
patients were reported to have stable disease, and 17 were reported to have
progressive disease. No relationship between Catrix dose and tumor [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) could be
established in this study.

The third published study of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer was a
[phase I/II trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45832&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that tested
the safety and the [efficacy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of orally administered Cartilade, a commercially
available powdered preparation of shark cartilage, in 60 patients with various
types of advanced solid tumors.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)] All but one patient in this trial had
been treated previously with conventional therapy. According to the design of
the study, no additional anticancer treatment could be given concurrently with
Cartilade therapy. No complete responses or partial responses were observed
among 50 evaluable patients who were treated with Cartilade for at least 6
weeks. However, stable disease that lasted 12 weeks or more was reported for
10 of the 50 patients. All ten of these patients eventually experienced
progressive disease.

Partial results of three other clinical studies of powdered shark cartilage
are described in two abstracts submitted for presentation at scientific
conferences,[[5](#cit/section_5.5),[6](#cit/section_5.6)] but complete results of these studies have not been
published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. All three studies were phase
II clinical trials that involved patients with advanced disease; two of the
studies were conducted by the same group of [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] These three
studies enrolled 20 patients with [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] 12 patients with [prostate
cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] and 12 patients with [primary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) brain tumors.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] All patients had
been treated previously with conventional therapy. No other anticancer
treatment was allowed concurrently with cartilage therapy. In two of the
studies,[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] the name of the cartilage product was not identified; however, in
the third study,[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] the commercially available product BeneFin was used. Ten
patients in each study completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and therefore were considered evaluable for response. No complete responses or
partial responses were observed in any of the studies. Two evaluable patients
in the breast cancer study were reported to have stable disease that lasted 8
weeks or more; two evaluable patients in the brain tumor study had stable
disease that lasted 20 weeks or more; and three evaluable patients in the
prostate cancer study had stable disease that also lasted 20 weeks or
more.

### Aqueous Extracts of Cartilage

In the phase II trial,[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] Catrix was administered by subcutaneous injection
only. All patients in this trial had [progressive disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45850&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) following
radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Identical individual doses of Catrix
were administered to each patient, but the duration of treatment and the total
delivered dose varied because of disease progression or death. The minimum
duration of Catrix treatment in this study was 4 weeks. One patient (with [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [renal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44988&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) reportedly had a
complete response that lasted more than 39 weeks. The remaining eight
patients did not respond to Catrix treatment. The researchers in this trial
also investigated whether Catrix had an effect on [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) function in
these patients. No consistent trend or change in the numbers, percentages, or
ratios of [white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(i.e., total [lymphocyte](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45765&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) counts, total [T cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) counts, total [B cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) counts,
percentage of T cells, percentage of B cells, and ratio of [helper T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44594&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to
[cytotoxic T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) was
observed, though increased numbers of T cells were found in three
patients.

The safety and the efficacy of AE-941/Neovastat, the previously mentioned
[aqueous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43998&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) extract of shark cartilage, has also been examined in clinical
studies.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)-[11](#cit/section_5.11),[15](#cit/section_5.15),[17](#cit/section_5.17)] It has been reported that AE-941/Neovastat has little [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[10](#cit/section_5.10),[11](#cit/section_5.11),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] In addition, there is evidence from a randomized clinical trial that examined the effect of AE-941/Neovastat on [angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) associated with surgical wound repair that this product contains at least one [antiangiogenic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44186&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) component that is orally [bioavailable](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44225&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[17](#cit/section_5.17)]

AE-941/Neovastat was administered to 331 patients with advanced solid tumors (including lung, prostate, breast, and kidney tumors) in two phase I/II trials.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] The results of these trials, however, have not been fully reported. A [retrospective](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44120&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) analysis involving a subgroup of patients with advanced [non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NSCLC) suggests that AE-941/Neovastat is able to lengthen the survival of patients with this disease.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] Furthermore, in a [prospective](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44079&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) analysis involving 22 patients with [refractory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45863&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) renal cell carcinoma, survival was longer in patients treated with 240 [mL](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/day AE-941/Neovastat than in patients treated with only 60 mL/day.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[10](#cit/section_5.10),[16](#cit/section_5.16)]

In 2003, the results of a phase I/II trial of AE-941/Neovastat in 80 patients with advanced NSCLC reported that there was a significant survival advantage for patients receiving the highest doses (2.6 mL/kg/day) of AE-941/Neovastat. A survival analysis of 48 patients with unresectable stage IIIA, IIIB, or IV NSCLC showed a median survival advantage of *P* = .0026 in patients receiving the highest doses. The trial was principally conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of orally administered AE-941/Neovastat when administered in escalating doses (30, 60, 120, and 240 mL/day). No dose-limiting toxicity was found, and no tumor response was observed.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)]

In 2001, a phase II trial (AETERNA-AE-MM-00-02) of AE-941/Neovastat was initiated in patients with [relapsed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or refractory [multiple myeloma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45793&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This trial closed approximately 1 year later, and no results have been reported.[[18](#cit/section_5.18)]

Two randomized phase III trials of AE-941/Neovastat in patients
with advanced cancer have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In one trial (MDA-ID-99303), which is completed, treatment
with oral AE-941/Neovastat plus chemotherapy and radiation therapy
was compared with treatment with placebo plus the same chemotherapy and radiation
therapy in patients with [stage III NSCLC](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45367&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In the second trial, which closed to patient recruitment in 2002, treatment
with oral AE-941/Neovastat was compared with treatment with placebo in
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Results from this second phase III trial have not been reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.[[19](#cit/section_5.19)] Despite AE-941/Neovastat being granted orphan drug status by the FDA in 2002 for use in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, the company that produces AE-941/Neovastat, Aeterna Laboratories, announced in early 2004 that this application would be discontinued in favor of a focus on the treatment of NSCLC.[[19](#cit/section_5.19),[20](#cit/section_5.20)]

In 2010, the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial aimed at assessing the effect of adding AE-941 to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy on the overall survival of patients with nonresectable stage III NSCLC were reported. A total of 379 eligible patients received induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy with chest radiation
therapy; participating centers used one of two chemotherapy regimens, either carboplatin and paclitaxel, or cisplatin and vinorelbine. No statistically significant difference in overall survival was observed between the group (n = 188) receiving chemotherapy and radiation
therapy plus AE-941 (120 mL administered orally twice daily) and the group receiving chemotherapy and radiation
therapy plus placebo (n = 191). Both AE-941 and placebo were well tolerated.[[21](#cit/section_5.21)]

## Adverse Effects

The [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) associated with [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy are generally described
as mild to moderate in severity. [Inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sites, [dysgeusia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44201&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), nausea, [dyspepsia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44200&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fever, dizziness, and [edema](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45676&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the [scrotum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46573&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been reported after treatment
with the bovine (cow) cartilage product Catrix.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[3](#cit/section_6.3)] Nausea, vomiting, [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cramping and/or bloating,
constipation, [hypotension](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [hyperglycemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44208&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), generalized weakness,
and [hypercalcemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45363&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been
associated with the use of powdered shark cartilage.[[4](#cit/section_6.4)-[6](#cit/section_6.6)] The high level of
[calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in shark cartilage may contribute to the development of
hypercalcemia.[[5](#cit/section_6.5),[7](#cit/section_6.7)] In addition, one case of [hepatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been associated with the
use of powdered shark cartilage.[[8](#cit/section_6.8)] Nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia are the most
commonly reported side effects following treatment with AE-941/Neovastat, the
[aqueous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43998&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) extract of shark cartilage.[[9](#cit/section_6.9)]

## Summary of the Evidence for Cartilage

Although at least a dozen [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a treatment for
people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been conducted since the early 1970s, relatively few results have
been reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. There are small amounts of reported data
from [phase III clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45833&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Additional clinical studies are now under
way. At present, the use of cartilage (bovine [cow] or shark) as a
treatment for people with cancer cannot be recommended outside the context of
well-designed clinical trials.

Separate [levels of evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and [scientific](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the use of cartilage (bovine and shark) in the treatment of people with cancer. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us"). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
