**NOTE: There is either no new research on this topic or the recent published research is weak and not appropriate for inclusion in the summary. Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only.**

This [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information summary provides an overview of
the use of [Newcastle disease virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NDV) as a treatment for people with cancer. The
summary includes a brief history of NDV research, a review of [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and
[animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the results of [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and possible [side
effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of NDV-based therapy. Several different strains of NDV will be
discussed in the summary, including the Hungarian strain MTH (More Than
Hope)-68.
Information presented in some sections of the summary can
also be found in tables located at the end of those sections.

This summary contains the following key information:

- NDV is usually thought to be an avian (i.e., bird) virus, but it also
[infects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) humans. Although NDV causes a potentially fatal, noncancerous disease
(Newcastle disease) in birds, it causes only minor illness in humans.
- NDV appears to [replicate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44621&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e.,
reproduce) substantially better in human cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) than it does in most
normal human cells.
- Individual strains of NDV are classified as [lytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44837&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [nonlytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44838&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Viruses of both strain types can
kill cancer cells, but lytic strains have the potential to do this more
quickly because they damage the [plasma membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44615&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of infected cells. Nonlytic strains appear to
kill by interfering with cell [metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Lytic strains of NDV have been studied in humans for their ability to kill
cancer cells directly, but viruses of both strain types have been used to make
[vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in an attempt to stimulate the
[immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to fight cancer.
- NDV-based anticancer therapy has been reported to be of benefit in more
than a dozen [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
but the results of these studies must be considered inconclusive because the
study designs were weak and the study reports were generally incomplete.

Many of the medical and scientific terms used in the summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the [NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/ "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/"), which is oriented toward nonexperts.

## General Information

Information presented in this section about the use of [Newcastle disease virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NDV) in the treatment
of human [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is summarized in [Table 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_158) below.

NDV is a [paramyxovirus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44614&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
causes Newcastle disease in a wide variety of birds (most notably, in
chickens).[[1](#cit/section_2.1)-[3](#cit/section_2.3)] This often fatal disease is characterized by
[inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [respiratory tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44490&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and of either
the brain or the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2),[4](#cit/section_2.4),[5](#cit/section_2.5)] NDV can also [infect](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
humans, but, in humans, it is generally not very [virulent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44842&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), causing only mild flu-like
symptoms or [conjunctivitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44197&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or
[laryngitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44605&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[6](#cit/section_2.6)-[14](#cit/section_2.14)] The
perception that NDV can [replicate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44621&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) up to 10,000 times better in human cancer
[cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) than in most normal human cells [[2](#cit/section_2.2),[6](#cit/section_2.6)-[10](#cit/section_2.10),[12](#cit/section_2.12),[13](#cit/section_2.13),[15](#cit/section_2.15)-[23](#cit/section_2.23)]
has prompted much interest in this virus as a potential anticancer agent. This phenomenon is apparently caused by defects in intracellular antiviral defenses of some cancer cells.[[24](#cit/section_2.24)-[26](#cit/section_2.26)] NDV was historically considered a complementary and alternative medicine approach, but in recent years it has been extensively studied by the conventional medical community. Also, genetically engineered NDV strains are being developed and studied for their anticancer activity.[[27](#cit/section_2.27)]

The [genetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46391&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) material of NDV is [RNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46568&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rather
than [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[3](#cit/section_2.3),[13](#cit/section_2.13),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[23](#cit/section_2.23),[28](#cit/section_2.28)-[31](#cit/section_2.31)] As
with other types of viruses, essentially all of NDV’s [replication cycle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44624&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) takes place
inside infected cells, which are also known as [host cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44597&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[13](#cit/section_2.13),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[30](#cit/section_2.30),[32](#cit/section_2.32)]
During a replication cycle, new virus [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and copies of the NDV genetic
material (i.e., [genome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44593&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are made in the
host cell’s [cytoplasm](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44586&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). NDV is also an
[enveloped virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44588&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which means
that [progeny](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44616&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) virus particles are
released from infected cells by budding off from them.[[18](#cit/section_2.18),[30](#cit/section_2.30),[33](#cit/section_2.33)]
In this process, single copies of the NDV genome become wrapped in an outer
coat (i.e., an envelope) that is made from a small piece of the host cell’s
[plasma membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44615&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Generally, the NDV outer coat contains only virus proteins
that have been specifically inserted into the host cell's plasma
membrane;[[18](#cit/section_2.18),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[32](#cit/section_2.32),[33](#cit/section_2.33)] however, some host cell proteins may be
included as well.[[34](#cit/section_2.34),[35](#cit/section_2.35)] Two specific virus proteins, [hemagglutinin-neuraminidase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44595&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the [fusion protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44591&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), are the main NDV
proteins found in the outer coat of isolated virus particles.[[3](#cit/section_2.3),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[30](#cit/section_2.30)]

There are many different strains of NDV, and they have been classified as
either [lytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44837&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [nonlytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44838&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for human cells. Lytic strains and nonlytic strains
both appear to replicate much more efficiently in human cancer cells than they
do in most normal human cells,[[12](#cit/section_2.12),[13](#cit/section_2.13),[15](#cit/section_2.15)-[20](#cit/section_2.20),[36](#cit/section_2.36)] and viruses of
both strain types have been investigated as potential anticancer agents. One
major difference between lytic strains and nonlytic strains is that lytic
strains are able to make infectious progeny virus particles in human cells,
whereas nonlytic strains are not.[[13](#cit/section_2.13),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[28](#cit/section_2.28)-[30](#cit/section_2.30),[37](#cit/section_2.37)] This difference
is due to the ability of lytic strains to produce activated
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein [molecules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the outer coat of progeny
viruses in human cells. The progeny virus particles made by nonlytic strains
contain inactive versions of these molecules. Activated
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein molecules are required for NDV
to enter a cell to replicate. Initial binding of NDV to a host cell takes
place through the interaction of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase molecules in the
virus coat with [sialic-acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44623&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)–containing molecules (i.e.,
[gangliosides](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44592&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) on the surface of the
cell. It is important to note, however, that nonlytic strains of NDV can make
infectious progeny viruses in some types of nonhuman cells (e.g., chicken
[embryo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44202&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells), thereby allowing these strains to be maintained.[[13](#cit/section_2.13),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[29](#cit/section_2.29),[36](#cit/section_2.36)]

Another major difference between lytic strains and nonlytic strains is
that, although they both have the potential to kill infected cells, the
mechanisms by which they accomplish this result are different. The production
of infectious progeny virus particles by lytic strains gives them the ability
to kill host cells fairly quickly. The budding of progeny viruses that
contain activated hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein molecules in
their outer coats causes the plasma membrane of NDV-infected cells to fuse
with the plasma membrane of adjacent cells, leading to the production of
large, [inviable](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44604&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) fused cells known as [syncytia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44625&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[12](#cit/section_2.12),[13](#cit/section_2.13),[18](#cit/section_2.18),[30](#cit/section_2.30)] The
more efficiently a lytic strain can replicate inside a host cell, the more
quickly it can kill that cell. The preferential killing of cancer cells by a
lytic virus is known as [oncolysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44612&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov);
thus, lytic strains of NDV are also called oncolytic strains. Nonlytic
strains of NDV kill infected cells more slowly, with death apparently the
result of [viral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44629&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disruption of normal host
cell metabolism.[[36](#cit/section_2.36),[38](#cit/section_2.38)]

The specific mechanism by which nonlytic NDV strains cause cell death in cancer cells has not been completely elucidated, but in Vero cells (derived from kidney epithelium) it was determined that NDV caused cell death by decreasing DNA content, increasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, increasing p53 level, and increasing caspase expression, resulting in apoptosis.[[39](#cit/section_2.39)-[41](#cit/section_2.41)]

As indicated previously, both lytic strains and nonlytic strains have been
investigated for their anticancer potential. In fact, the major differences
between the two strain types have been exploited to develop three different
approaches to cancer therapy:

1. The infection of cancer patients with a lytic strain of NDV.
2. The use of
[oncolysates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), i.e., preparations
containing plasma membrane fragments from NDV-infected cancer calls, as
anticancer [vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. The use of intact cancer cells infected with a nonlytic strain of NDV as
[whole cell vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44923&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

One proposed advantage of the first approach is that virus replication may
allow the spread of [cytotoxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) viruses
to every cancer cell in the body;[[8](#cit/section_2.8),[34](#cit/section_2.34)] however, the production of
[virus-neutralizing
antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44631&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) might limit this possibility.[[6](#cit/section_2.6),[8](#cit/section_2.8),[13](#cit/section_2.13),[30](#cit/section_2.30),[40](#cit/section_2.40)] The rationale for the second and third approaches is that [tumor-specific antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44628&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(i.e., proteins or other molecules that are generally located in the plasma
membrane of cancer cells and that are either unique to cancer cells or much
more abundant in them) may be better recognized by the immune system if they
are associated with virus [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(i.e., virus proteins that have been inserted into the plasma membrane of host
cells).[[8](#cit/section_2.8),[12](#cit/section_2.12),[13](#cit/section_2.13),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[32](#cit/section_2.32),[34](#cit/section_2.34),[42](#cit/section_2.42)-[48](#cit/section_2.48)] If this enhanced recognition takes
place, then it may increase the chance that cancer cells, whether they are
virus infected or not, will be recognized as foreign by the immune system
and be destroyed.[[8](#cit/section_2.8),[12](#cit/section_2.12),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[47](#cit/section_2.47),[48](#cit/section_2.48)]

The principal developers of the third approach have stated that whole cell
vaccines can stimulate the immune system better than oncolysates, and that cells infected with a nonlytic strain of
NDV will remain intact in the body long enough to generate these more
effective immune responses.[[18](#cit/section_2.18),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[29](#cit/section_2.29),[36](#cit/section_2.36)-[38](#cit/section_2.38),[43](#cit/section_2.43),[46](#cit/section_2.46),[49](#cit/section_2.49)-[51](#cit/section_2.51)] It should be noted that the
cancer cells used in the third approach are treated with enough [gamma radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44031&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to prevent
further cell division, but not enough to cause cell death, either before or
after they are infected with the nonlytic virus.[[49](#cit/section_2.49),[50](#cit/section_2.50),[52](#cit/section_2.52)-[58](#cit/section_2.58),[13](#cit/section_2.13)]
This precaution ensures that patients are not given a vaccine that contains
actively [proliferating](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44572&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer
cells.

Either a patient’s own cancer cells (i.e., [autologous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44912&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells) or cells from another
patient with the same type of cancer (i.e., [allogeneic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44920&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells) can be used to make
oncolysates and whole cell vaccines. It is important to note that immune
system responses similar to those obtained with oncolysates and whole cell
vaccines may occur in patients infected with a lytic strain of NDV and that
these [responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) would be expected to
contribute to any observed anticancer effect.

To conduct [human studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with viruses, vaccines, or other [biological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44510&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
materials in the United States, researchers must file an [Investigational](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44763&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) New
Drug (IND) application with the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA).
Biological materials and drugs have been held to similar safety and
effectiveness standards since 1972. In an IND application, researchers must
provide safety and [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) data from [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to justify
the [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the route, and the schedule of administration to be used in the
proposed clinical studies. Among the safety issues to be addressed,
researchers must demonstrate an absence of harmful contaminants. Most human
studies of NDV as an anticancer agent have taken place outside the United
States; therefore, they have not required an IND. At present, at least one group of U.S. [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has filed an IND application to study NDV as an anticancer treatment.[[59](#cit/section_2.59)] It should be noted that the FDA has not approved the use of NDV to treat any medical condition.

The NDV strains that have been evaluated most widely for the treatment of
cancer are 73-T, MTH-68, and Ulster.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[6](#cit/section_2.6),[11](#cit/section_2.11),[22](#cit/section_2.22),[42](#cit/section_2.42),[45](#cit/section_2.45),[49](#cit/section_2.49)-[58](#cit/section_2.58),[60](#cit/section_2.60)-[74](#cit/section_2.74)] Strain 73-T is lytic, and Ulster is nonlytic. Strain MTH-68 has not
been classified, but it is assumed to be lytic.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[6](#cit/section_2.6),[66](#cit/section_2.66),[75](#cit/section_2.75),[22](#cit/section_2.22),[76](#cit/section_2.76),[77](#cit/section_2.77)]
All three strains have shown little or no evidence of [neurotropism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44610&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., an ability to
replicate efficiently in normal nerve cells or normal [neural](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44609&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tissue).

In animal studies, NDV infection has been accomplished by [intratumoral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44603&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [intraperitoneal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46339&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [intramuscular](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44048&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection.[[9](#cit/section_2.9),[10](#cit/section_2.10),[12](#cit/section_2.12),[23](#cit/section_2.23),[28](#cit/section_2.28),[36](#cit/section_2.36),[36](#cit/section_2.36),[43](#cit/section_2.43),[78](#cit/section_2.78)]
NDV-infected, whole cell vaccines have been given to animals by
intraperitoneal,[[46](#cit/section_2.46)] [intradermal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44602&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[47](#cit/section_2.47)] or
subcutaneous injection,or by a combination of subcutaneous
and intramuscular injection.[[36](#cit/section_2.36),[43](#cit/section_2.43),[79](#cit/section_2.79)]

In human studies, NDV oncolysates have been administered by subcutaneous
[[11](#cit/section_2.11),[42](#cit/section_2.42),[45](#cit/section_2.45),[60](#cit/section_2.60),[63](#cit/section_2.63),[65](#cit/section_2.65),[67](#cit/section_2.67)-[70](#cit/section_2.70)] or intradermal [[62](#cit/section_2.62),[64](#cit/section_2.64)] injection. NDV-infected,
whole cell vaccines have been administered by intradermal injection
only.[[49](#cit/section_2.49),[50](#cit/section_2.50),[52](#cit/section_2.52)-[58](#cit/section_2.58),[71](#cit/section_2.71)-[73](#cit/section_2.73)] In cases where patients have been infected with a

## History

The first published report to establish a link between [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with a
[virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45941&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the [regression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
appeared in 1912.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[6](#cit/section_3.6)] This report described a woman
whose [cervical cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444973&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) improved
following treatment to prevent [rabies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44617&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
The woman had been bitten by a dog, and she was subsequently injected with a
[vaccine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) made of [attenuated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e.,
weakened) rabies virus. Over the next 60 years, many other viruses, including
[Newcastle disease virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NDV), were shown to have anticancer potential.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[3](#cit/section_3.3)-[25](#cit/section_3.25)] The first report of positive
results using NDV as a treatment for human cancer was published in 1964.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)]
By that time, attenuated strains of NDV had been used for almost 2 decades
to prevent Newcastle disease in birds, and the inability of this virus to
cause serious illness in humans had been established.

As indicated previously (refer to the [General Information](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_5) section of this summary for more information), cells infected with
NDV can be killed directly by the virus or indirectly through an [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
response to the infection. The immune system uses a variety of approaches to
kill virus-infected cells, including attack by [cytotoxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells (i.e., [natural killer cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44062&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or [cytotoxic T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)); attack by
antivirus [antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are made by
[B cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); and the release of
[cytokines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46130&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[2](#cit/section_3.2),[6](#cit/section_3.6),[15](#cit/section_3.15),[18](#cit/section_3.18),[22](#cit/section_3.22),[25](#cit/section_3.25)-[28](#cit/section_3.28)]

Cytokines can be directly cytotoxic to virus-infected cells (e.g., [tumor necrosis factor
[TNF]](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-alpha).[[14](#cit/section_3.14),[15](#cit/section_3.15),[20](#cit/section_3.20)] In addition, they can stimulate
increases in the activity and/or numbers of specific types of immune system
cells (e.g., [interferon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-alpha,
interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha).[[2](#cit/section_3.2),[29](#cit/section_3.29)-[31](#cit/section_3.31)]

As also indicated previously (refer to the [General Information](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_5) section of this summary for more information), if the immune
system is responding to virus-infected cancer cells (or fragments of cancer
cells), then better recognition of [tumor-specific antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44628&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may occur, and an
increased ability to kill uninfected cancer cells may be acquired.[[15](#cit/section_3.15),[18](#cit/section_3.18),[19](#cit/section_3.19),[23](#cit/section_3.23),[26](#cit/section_3.26),[30](#cit/section_3.30),[32](#cit/section_3.32)-[38](#cit/section_3.38)] The immune system would use the same approaches to kill
uninfected cancer cells that it uses to kill virus-infected cells. For
example, it has been shown that TNF-alpha is directly cytotoxic to some, but
not all, cancer cells, whereas normal cells are not harmed by this
cytokine.[[39](#cit/section_3.39)-[42](#cit/section_3.42)]

## Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies

### Effects of Newcastle Disease Virus on Human Cancer Cells

The ability of Newcastle disease [virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45941&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NDV) to [replicate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44621&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) efficiently in human cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has been
demonstrated in both [laboratory studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[14](#cit/section_4.14)] Further, several of these studies
suggest that [lytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44837&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) strains of NDV are also
oncolytic, and one study has demonstrated that expression of the *RAC1* gene is necessary for NDV replication.[[15](#cit/section_4.15)]

Lytic strain 73-T has been shown to replicate efficiently in human tumor cells [[16](#cit/section_4.16)] and kill the following types of
human cancer cells *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)*: [fibrosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46403&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [osteosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45395&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [neuroblastoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45418&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45963&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[cervical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44102&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma, [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [Wilms tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45946&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [myeloid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46279&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45343&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8),[9](#cit/section_4.9)] It killed normal human lung fibroblasts *in vitro* at the same rate that it killed cancer cells.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)] However,
this strain did not kill human [B-cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45368&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., [Burkitt lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) cells *in
vitro* [[8](#cit/section_4.8)] and did not kill normal, [proliferating](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44572&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) human
[white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or normal human skin [fibroblasts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44590&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) *in vitro*.[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8)]

Lytic strain Roakin has been reported to kill human lymphoma B cells and T cells transformed *in
vitro*
from a [Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270800&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patient four to five times faster than it killed normal, [resting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44622&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) human white blood cells.[[4](#cit/section_4.4),[5](#cit/section_4.5)]
This strain killed normal, proliferating
human white blood cells *in vitro*, although at a lower rate than in cancer cells.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

Lytic strain Italien (or Italian) has been shown to kill human [squamous cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46056&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lung carcinoma,
melanoma, [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma, and [larynx](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46026&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
carcinoma, but not cervical carcinoma, cells *in vitro*.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)]

Overall, these results suggest that the lytic strains of NDV replicate well in some types of normal cells and replicate poorly in some types of cancer cells. These data and the absence of serious illness in
individuals [infected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with NDV [[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[3](#cit/section_4.3),[10](#cit/section_4.10),[13](#cit/section_4.13),[17](#cit/section_4.17)-[22](#cit/section_4.22)] are consistent with
the view that NDV may replicate more efficiently in human cancer cells than
it does in most types of normal human cells (i.e., “DBTRG.05MG human glioblastoma,” “U-87MG human astrocytoma,”[[23](#cit/section_4.23)] “rat F98 glioblastoma cells,”[[24](#cit/section_4.24)] and “mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma”).[[25](#cit/section_4.25)]

[Nonlytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44838&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) NDV strain Ulster has also been shown to replicate
efficiently in human cancer cells *in vitro*, including cells of the following
types of human [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- [Colorectal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
carcinoma.
- [Gastric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46770&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma.
- [Pancreatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44074&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma.
- Bladder carcinoma.
- Breast carcinoma.
- [Ovarian](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44984&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma.
- [Renal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=661352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Lung
carcinoma.
- Larynx carcinoma.
- Cervical carcinoma.
- [Glioblastoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45698&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Melanoma.
- B-cell
lymphoma.
- T-cell lymphoma.

This strain does not replicate efficiently in normal human white blood cells *in
vitro*.[[7](#cit/section_4.7)] Other experiments have shown that NDV Ulster can kill infected
cells [[14](#cit/section_4.14),[26](#cit/section_4.26)] and that it can replicate in human cancer cells
regardless of cell cycle.[[7](#cit/section_4.7),[21](#cit/section_4.21)]

The ability of lytic strains of NDV to kill human cancer cells *[in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* has also been examined. In [xenograft](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44095&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) studies, human cancer cells
were [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) either [subcutaneously](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [intradermally](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44602&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into [athymic, nude mice](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44579&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., mice
that do not reject tumor cells from other animals because they have a
defective [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), and tumors were allowed to form. NDV was
injected directly into the tumors, and tumor growth and animal survival were
monitored. Injection produced complete tumor
[regression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in 75% to 100% of mice bearing human fibrosarcoma, neuroblastoma,
or cervical carcinoma tumors.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[3](#cit/section_4.3),[10](#cit/section_4.10)] Intratumoral injection of 73-T was
also associated with more than 80% tumor regression in 66% of mice bearing
human [synovial sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44626&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
tumors.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] In addition, intratumoral injection inhibited 68% to 96% of tumor growth in mice bearing human [epidermoid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), colon, lung,
breast, or prostate carcinoma tumors.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)]

Intratumoral injection of strain Italien was associated with complete tumor
regression in 100% of mice bearing human melanoma tumors. The growth of [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumors in these animals was not affected, suggesting that the virus was unable to disseminate
widely throughout the body.[[11](#cit/section_4.11),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[21](#cit/section_4.21)]

In the above-mentioned neuroblastoma xenograft study, strain 73-T replicated over time in tumor tissue but replicated poorly when injected into the thigh muscle of athymic, nude mice.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] This finding is consistent with the
proposal that NDV replicates more efficiently in cancer cells than in
most normal cells.

In another nude mouse study, strain V4UPM inhibited the growth of some cell lines of subcutaneously injected human glioblastoma multiforme cells.[[23](#cit/section_4.23)] All four mice with tumors from the U-87MG cell line experienced sustained complete responses after one injection. However, no complete responses were observed in mice with tumors from the DBTRG.05MG cell line despite a similar *in vitro* cytotoxicity compared with U-87MG.

In yet another nude mouse study, a single intraperitoneal injection of strain 73-T in mice bearing human neuroblastoma xenografts resulted in complete, durable tumor regressions in 9 of 12 (75%) of the treated mice.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)]

Athymic, nude mice make small numbers of
[T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and they produce [interferons](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[natural killer cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44062&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [macrophages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44054&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[11](#cit/section_4.11),[27](#cit/section_4.27),[28](#cit/section_4.28)] It is possible that these residual components of the immune system, which may be
activated by the presence of NDV, contributed to the antitumor effects
observed in the xenograft studies.

### NDV and Cancer Immunotherapy

Other laboratory and animal studies have shown that NDV and NDV-infected
cancer cells can stimulate a variety of immune system responses that are
essential to the successful [immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
cancer.[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8),[11](#cit/section_4.11),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[26](#cit/section_4.26),[29](#cit/section_4.29)-[48](#cit/section_4.48)] A few of these studies used human cells,[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[30](#cit/section_4.30),[31](#cit/section_4.31),[39](#cit/section_4.39),[42](#cit/section_4.42),[43](#cit/section_4.43),[45](#cit/section_4.45),[48](#cit/section_4.48)] but most used animal cells and animal [tumor models](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44091&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8),[11](#cit/section_4.11),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[26](#cit/section_4.26),[29](#cit/section_4.29),[31](#cit/section_4.31)-[38](#cit/section_4.38),[40](#cit/section_4.40),[44](#cit/section_4.44)-[47](#cit/section_4.47)]

Two of these *in vitro* studies demonstrated that infection of human immune cells
with NDV causes the cells to produce and release [cytokines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46130&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
interferon-alpha and [tumor necrosis factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TNF)-alpha.[[6](#cit/section_4.6),[8](#cit/section_4.8)] In one of these studies,[[6](#cit/section_4.6)] infection of human cancer cells with NDV made the cells
more sensitive to the [cytotoxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects of TNF-alpha.

Some *in vitro* studies have shown that NDV-infected human cancer cells
are better at activating human [cytotoxic T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [helper T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44594&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and natural killer
cells than uninfected cancer cells.[[8](#cit/section_4.8),[30](#cit/section_4.30),[31](#cit/section_4.31),[49](#cit/section_4.49)] The NDV [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
[hemagglutinin-neuraminidase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44595&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is present in the [plasma membrane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44615&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
virus-infected cells, appears to play a role in the enhancement of
T cell activation. There is evidence that this protein makes infected cells
more adhesive, thereby promoting the interaction between
virus-infected cells and immune system cells.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[31](#cit/section_4.31)]

Laboratory studies have shown that the interaction between
NDV-infected cancer cells and T cells can be improved if [monoclonal antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46066&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
bind the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein on the cancer cells and either
the CD3 protein or the CD28 protein on T cells (i.e., [bispecific monoclonal
antibodies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44582&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are also used.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[30](#cit/section_4.30),[39](#cit/section_4.39),[45](#cit/section_4.45),[48](#cit/section_4.48),[50](#cit/section_4.50),[51](#cit/section_4.51)] It has been
reported that this improved interaction leads to better T cell
activation.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[30](#cit/section_4.30),[39](#cit/section_4.39),[45](#cit/section_4.45),[48](#cit/section_4.48)] T cells exposed to
NDV-infected human colon cancer cells and bispecific monoclonal antibodies
showed not only an increased ability to kill the virus-infected cells but also
an ability to inhibit the proliferation of uninfected colon cancer
cells.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[30](#cit/section_4.30),[39](#cit/section_4.39)] On the basis of these and other *in vitro*
findings, it has been proposed that [vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) consisting of NDV-infected cancer
cells and bispecific monoclonal antibodies be tested in
humans.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[30](#cit/section_4.30),[39](#cit/section_4.39),[45](#cit/section_4.45),[48](#cit/section_4.48)]

As noted above, animal cells and animal tumor models have also been used to
explore the immunotherapy potential of NDV. ESb, a mouse model of metastatic
T-cell lymphoma has been employed in most of this
work;[[11](#cit/section_4.11),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[26](#cit/section_4.26),[29](#cit/section_4.29),[32](#cit/section_4.32),[36](#cit/section_4.36)-[38](#cit/section_4.38),[40](#cit/section_4.40),[41](#cit/section_4.41),[44](#cit/section_4.44)-[48](#cit/section_4.48)] however,
additional experiments have utilized one or more of the following
tumor models: mouse B16 melanoma,[[34](#cit/section_4.34)] mouse Lewis lung carcinoma,[[33](#cit/section_4.33),[36](#cit/section_4.36)] mouse
P815 [mastocytoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44607&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[36](#cit/section_4.36)] mouse Ca
761-P93 [mammary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44560&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma,[[36](#cit/section_4.36)] and
guinea pig L10 [hepatocellular carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46363&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[35](#cit/section_4.35)]

In one study,[[36](#cit/section_4.36)] it was shown that anticancer activity could be induced in
mouse macrophages both *in vitro* and *in vivo* by infection with NDV strain
Ulster. Similar activation of mouse macrophages *in vitro* was observed after
infection with the NDV lytic strain Lasota. In this study, the activated
macrophages showed cytotoxic activity toward ESb, P815 mastocytoma, and Ca
761-P93 mammary carcinoma cells *in vitro*. Other experiments demonstrated
that much of the observed anticancer activity could be attributed to the
production and release of TNF-alpha by the infected macrophages. In addition,
the infected, activated macrophages showed anticancer activity *in vivo* when
they were injected into mice bearing Ca 761-P93 mammary carcinoma or Lewis
lung carcinoma tumors.[[36](#cit/section_4.36)] Human macrophages stimulated with NDV Ulster have also been shown to kill various types of human tumor cells.[[52](#cit/section_4.52)]

In another study,[[11](#cit/section_4.11)] intratumoral injection of NDV strain
Ulster into growing ESb tumors in [immunocompetent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44835&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) mice led to a
cessation of tumor growth and an absence of [metastases](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in 42% of treated animals. In
the remaining mice, tumor growth and metastatic spread continued at the same
rate as in [control animals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44585&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
Additional results from this study indicated that the anticancer effect in the
responding animals was due primarily to the activation of T cells directed
against a [tumor-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44628&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on ESb cells rather than a virus
antigen.

Other studies with NDV Ulster and the ESb tumor model support the idea that
virus proteins inserted in the plasma membrane of NDV-infected cancer cells
may help the immune system recognize tumor-specific antigens better,
potentially leading to an increased ability to kill uninfected cancer cells and virus-infected cells.[[11](#cit/section_4.11),[21](#cit/section_4.21),[26](#cit/section_4.26),[29](#cit/section_4.29),[32](#cit/section_4.32),[37](#cit/section_4.37),[38](#cit/section_4.38),[40](#cit/section_4.40),[44](#cit/section_4.44),[46](#cit/section_4.46),[47](#cit/section_4.47)]
At least four studies [[26](#cit/section_4.26),[29](#cit/section_4.29),[38](#cit/section_4.38),[40](#cit/section_4.40),[46](#cit/section_4.46),[47](#cit/section_4.47)] have shown that T cells
isolated from mice that have growing ESb tumors can be activated *in vitro* by
[co-culture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44584&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with NDV-infected ESb
cells and that the resulting activated T cells possess an enhanced ability to
kill uninfected ESb cells *in vitro*. In addition, two *in vivo* studies [[11](#cit/section_4.11),[32](#cit/section_4.32)] have shown that mice injected with NDV-infected, [irradiated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44836&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ESb cells are 30 to 250 times
more resistant to later injection with proliferating ESb cells than mice that
are initially injected with uninfected, irradiated ESb cells. Furthermore, at
least two *in vivo* studies have demonstrated that [vaccination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45937&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of mice with NDV-infected,
irradiated ESb cells after surgery to remove a growing ESb [primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can prevent the growth
of metastatic tumors in approximately 50% of treated animals.[[11](#cit/section_4.11),[32](#cit/section_4.32),[37](#cit/section_4.37),[44](#cit/section_4.44),[46](#cit/section_4.46),[47](#cit/section_4.47)] When the surviving mice were subsequently injected with
proliferating ESb cells, they all remained free of cancer, indicating that the
NDV/tumor cell vaccine had conferred anticancer immunity.[[32](#cit/section_4.32),[37](#cit/section_4.37)] Similar results were obtained from *in vivo* studies that employed the
mouse B16 melanoma model,[[34](#cit/section_4.34)] the mouse Lewis lung carcinoma model,[[33](#cit/section_4.33)] or the
guinea pig L10 hepatocellular carcinoma model.[[35](#cit/section_4.35)]

One factor that may influence the effectiveness of NDV/tumor cell vaccines
is overall [tumor burden](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44627&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Results
obtained with the B16 mouse melanoma model suggest that these vaccines are
less effective in individuals with advanced metastatic disease.[[34](#cit/section_4.34)]

## Human/Clinical Studies

The anticancer potential of [Newcastle disease virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NDV) has been investigated in
[clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, and Hungary. These studies
have evaluated the use of [oncolysates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[14](#cit/section_5.14)] [whole cell vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44923&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[14](#cit/section_5.14)-[37](#cit/section_5.37)] and
[infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of patients with a [lytic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44837&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) strain of the virus.[[14](#cit/section_5.14),[38](#cit/section_5.38)-[52](#cit/section_5.52)] Findings from most of the studies, almost all of which
were [phase I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [phase II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45831&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) clinical trials, have been
reported in English-language biomedical journals. Overall, the results
of these studies must be considered preliminary. Most studies enrolled only
small numbers of patients, and [historical control
subjects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44596&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), rather than actual [control groups](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which were often used for
outcome comparisons. In addition, the evaluation of many studies is made
difficult by poor descriptions of study design and the incomplete reporting of
clinical data.

### Immunotherapy With Oncolysates

The following information is summarized in [Table 2](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_193) below.

The use of NDV oncolysates in patients with [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was
evaluated in four clinical studies in the United States.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[6](#cit/section_5.6),[9](#cit/section_5.9)-[11](#cit/section_5.11),[14](#cit/section_5.14)] Three of these studies—a phase I clinical trial [[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10)] and
two phase II clinical trials [[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[11](#cit/section_5.11)]—were conducted by the same group
of [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In all four studies, NDV strain 73-T was used to prepare
oncolysate [vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In the phase I study,[[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10)] 13 patients who had advanced disease and who
had not responded to [conventional therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44198&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
alone or surgery plus [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
and/or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) were
treated [subcutaneously](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) once a week or once every other week with [injections](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
NDV oncolysates prepared from either their own tumor cells (i.e., [autologous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44912&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
vaccines) or [cultured melanoma cell lines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44016&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(i.e., [allogeneic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44920&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) vaccines). Several patients received additional
conventional therapy while undergoing NDV treatment. Blood samples collected
during the study showed increases in [T cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44928&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) numbers and the [cytotoxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44020&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
activity of [lymphocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45765&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in most
patients (the latter was measured against melanoma cells *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)*).[[9](#cit/section_5.9)] One patient showed a [complete response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] This
patient, who was alive and apparently cancer-free at the end of the study
period (a survival of more than 112 weeks), received six courses of
chemotherapy while undergoing oncolysate treatment and had the least advanced
disease of the patients studied. Minor responses in some skin and [lymph node](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [metastases](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were noted in
several other patients, but no responses in [visceral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44843&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) metastases were detected.

As indicated above, the researchers who conducted this phase I study also
conducted two phase II studies. The phase II studies tested the ability of NDV
oncolysates to delay the [progression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44078&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
of melanoma from [regional cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45865&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
to [systemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[11](#cit/section_5.11)] The
patients in these phase II studies had undergone surgery to remove the primary
cancer and the [radical lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44618&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) because of the presence of [palpable disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44613&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [regional lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44312&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The first phase II study involved 32 patients, 5 of whom had been
treated previously with other types of [immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45729&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[11](#cit/section_5.11)] Melanoma
was detected in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes in 84% of the patients, in
4 to 5 regional lymph nodes in 9% of the patients, and in 6 to 8
regional lymph nodes in 6% of the patients. The second phase II study was
initiated 4 years after the start of the first one, and it involved 51
additional patients.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[11](#cit/section_5.11)] Among these latter patients, 66% had melanoma
detected in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes, 16% had melanoma detected in
4 to 5 regional lymph nodes, and 18% had melanoma detected in 6 or
more regional lymph nodes.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[11](#cit/section_5.11)]

In both studies, the patients were given subcutaneous injections of NDV
oncolysates once a week for 4 weeks, beginning 4 to 8 weeks after surgery,
followed by more subcutaneous injections given every 2 weeks until 1 year
after surgery, and then continued subcutaneous injections given at intervals
that increased gradually to every 3 months over the course of a 5-year period.
From years 5 through 15 after surgery, some patients received additional
oncolysate injections, which were given at intervals varying in length from 3
months to 6 months. Four of the patients in the first study were treated with
both autologous and allogeneic vaccines, whereas the remaining patients in
that study and all of the patients in the second study were treated with
allogeneic vaccines only. Five years after surgery, 72% of the
patients in the first study and 63% of the patients in the second study were
reported to be alive and free of detectable melanoma.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)] The corresponding
survival value for historical control subjects who had palpable regional
disease was approximately 17% (a value derived from the scientific
literature).[[11](#cit/section_5.11)] Ten years after surgery, 69% of the patients in the first
study and 59% of the patients in the second study were reported to be alive
and free of detectable melanoma,[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] compared with survival values of 5% to
15% for historical control subjects who had palpable regional disease or 33%
for historical control subjects who had either palpable regional disease or
[microscopic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44608&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) evidence of regional
lymph node metastasis.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2)] Fifteen years after surgery, [overall survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44070&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) values of 59% and
53% were reported for patients in the first and second studies, respectively,
with one survivor in the first study experiencing metastatic disease.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] In
general, survival in these two studies did not seem to be influenced by the
number of regional lymph nodes that were positive for cancer at the time of
radical lymph node dissection, and the patients who received both autologous
and allogeneic vaccines did not appear to fare any better than the patients
who received allogeneic vaccines only.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]

The fourth U.S. study of NDV oncolysates in patients with melanoma was also
a phase II trial.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] This trial, which was conducted by a different group of
researchers, involved 24 patients who likewise had disease that had spread to
regional lymph nodes. The patients in this trial were treated in a manner
similar to that of the patients in the other two phase II trials. In this
trial, however, only 37% of the patients remained disease free 5 years after
surgery; this [disease-free
survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44023&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) percentage did not differ substantially from the 30%
disease-free survival estimated for a group of historical control subjects who
had been treated at the same institution with surgery alone or surgery and
another type of [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[6](#cit/section_5.6)]

In contrast to the evidence of benefit found in the other phase II trials, the absence of benefit for NDV oncolysates in this fourth clinical trial
remains to be explained. It has been reported that different methods of
oncolysate preparation were used by the two groups of investigators who
conducted these studies.[[51](#cit/section_5.51)] The positive results obtained by the first
research group, however, must be viewed with caution. Until these results are
confirmed independently in larger, randomized clinical trials, they should be
considered preliminary.

Two additional phase II studies of NDV oncolysates have been conducted in
Germany. One study involved 208 patients with locally advanced [renal cell
carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44988&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., large tumors and no regional lymph node metastasis or tumors
of any size and 1 or 2 regional lymph nodes positive for cancer).[[8](#cit/section_5.8),[12](#cit/section_5.12)]
The second study involved 22 patients with either metastatic breast cancer or
metastatic ovarian cancer.[[5](#cit/section_5.5),[7](#cit/section_5.7)]

In the advanced renal cell carcinoma study,[[8](#cit/section_5.8),[12](#cit/section_5.12)] strain 73-T was used to
prepare autologous oncolysates that were given to patients by subcutaneous
injection once a week for 8 to 10 weeks beginning 1 to 3 months after radical
surgery (i.e., [nephrectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46265&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [regional lymph node dissection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44620&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Two [cytokines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46130&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), low-dose [recombinant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44619&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [interleukin-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45256&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and recombinant
[interferon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-alpha, were added to the oncolysate vaccines. Among the 208
patients who entered this study, 203 were followed for a period of time that
ranged from 6 months to 64 months from the date of surgery, and these patients
were considered [evaluable](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44029&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for
response. Approximately 91% of the evaluable patients remained free of
detectable cancer during follow-up; 9% showed signs of [progressive disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45850&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The
[median](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44941&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) time to [relapse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was more than 21 months. Fifty-six
of the evaluable patients had 23 months to 64 months of follow-up from the
time of surgery, and approximately 18% of these individuals showed signs of
progressive disease during follow-up. All relapses in this subset of 56
patients occurred within 34 months of surgery.

The researchers who conducted this study concluded that the results
demonstrated improved disease-free survival for the study subjects in
comparison with survival data published in the scientific literature for
similar patients who were treated with surgery alone.[[8](#cit/section_5.8),[12](#cit/section_5.12)] Because this
study was [uncontrolled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), however, it is not clear whether the improvement in
disease-free survival was due to chance alone, to oncolysate therapy alone, to
cytokine therapy alone, or to the combination of oncolysate therapy and
cytokine therapy.

The same research group conducted a parallel investigation in which [immune
system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) responses to combination oncolysate and cytokine therapy were measured
in 38 patients who had advanced renal cell carcinoma.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] In this parallel
study, responses to NDV [antigens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46086&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., the production of anti-NDV antibodies)
and transient increases in blood levels of the cytokines interferon-alpha,
interferon-gamma, and [tumor necrosis factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TNF)-alpha were found, but responses thought to be
important to effective antitumor immunity (i.e., the production of antibodies
against tumor-specific antigens, increases in natural killer (NK) cell activity,
and increases in blood levels of [helper T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44594&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [i.e., CD4 antigen–positive
cells] and [cytotoxic T cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [i.e., CD8 antigen–positive cells]) were
not.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)]

The phase II study of NDV oncolysates in patients with metastatic [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or
metastatic [ovarian](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44984&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer was described by its investigators as a study of
autologous, whole cell vaccines.[[5](#cit/section_5.5),[7](#cit/section_5.7)] The lytic strain Italien, however, was
used in this study, so it is likely that immune system responses in the
treated patients were stimulated by cellular fragments rather than by intact
cancer cells.

In the study, 22 patients were [vaccinated](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44841&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by [intradermal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44602&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection at
least 3 times during a 6- to 8-week period that began 2 weeks after surgery
to remove [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells (either
[primary tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45847&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells or metastatic tumor cells). The patients also received
[intravenous injections](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cyclophosphamide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45253&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), high-dose
recombinant interleukin-2, and autologous lymphocytes that had been simulated
*in vitro* by treatment with interleukin-2. The cyclophosphamide was
administered to block the activity of a class of T cells (i.e., suppressor T
cells) that might weaken the desired immune responses. On average, the
patients were followed for a period of 23 months from the time of surgery.
Nine patients were reported to have either a complete response or a [partial response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45819&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after vaccine
therapy. Five patients had [stable disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45884&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and eight had
progressive disease. The average duration of response was 5 months, after
which disease progression was again observed. Blood samples taken from the
patients during therapy showed increases in the numbers of NK
cells and increases in serum concentrations of the cytokines interferon-alpha
and TNF-alpha, but these changes did not persist. No other immune system
responses were detected. Because this was an uncontrolled study, it is
unclear whether any of the observed clinical and/or immune system responses
can be attributed to treatment with NDV oncolysates. Furthermore, because the
lytic strain Italien was used in the study, the possibility that the observed
tumor regressions were due, in part, to oncolysis cannot be ruled out.

### Immunotherapy With Whole Cell Vaccines

The following information is summarized in [Table 3](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_194) below.

Most clinical studies of NDV-infected, whole cell vaccines that have been
reported in scientific literature were conducted in
Germany.[[15](#cit/section_5.15)-[27](#cit/section_5.27),[31](#cit/section_5.31),[32](#cit/section_5.32)] However, the largest reported trial was performed in China.[[14](#cit/section_5.14),[33](#cit/section_5.33)-[36](#cit/section_5.36)] Most of these studies
involved patients with colorectal cancer,[[15](#cit/section_5.15),[16](#cit/section_5.16),[19](#cit/section_5.19),[20](#cit/section_5.20),[22](#cit/section_5.22),[33](#cit/section_5.33)] breast
cancer,[[17](#cit/section_5.17),[18](#cit/section_5.18),[25](#cit/section_5.25)] ovarian cancer,[[17](#cit/section_5.17),[18](#cit/section_5.18),[23](#cit/section_5.23)] renal cell cancer,[[21](#cit/section_5.21),[26](#cit/section_5.26)] or malignant glioma.[[31](#cit/section_5.31)] The
nonlytic strain NDV Ulster was used to prepare autologous tumor cell vaccines
in all of the studies.

Data from a 2004 pilot clinical trial of an NDV-modified autologous tumor vaccine in 20 patients with stage III or IV head and neck squamous cell carcinomas suggest that the vaccine strategy can stimulate human antitumor immune responses in a manner similar to those found in animal models and may significantly prolong 5-year survival rates in this patient population. The study demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the vaccine regimen, and no major side effects were observed in any of the patients.[[53](#cit/section_5.53)]

The use of NDV-infected, whole cell vaccines in patients with either
locally advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma was examined in one phase I clinical trial and two phase II clinical trials.[[15](#cit/section_5.15),[16](#cit/section_5.16),[19](#cit/section_5.19),[20](#cit/section_5.20),[22](#cit/section_5.22)] The
phase I trial helped establish the optimum number of tumor cells and the
optimum amount of virus to use in the average patient to produce the best
possible immune response. Immune responses were monitored by means of a skin
test that measured the extent of [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and hardening of the skin at
vaccination sites (i.e., [delayed-type hypersensitivity responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44587&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The exact number of patients
treated in this trial cannot be determined because nonidentical patient
populations were described in the two published study reports.[[19](#cit/section_5.19),[20](#cit/section_5.20)] One
report lists 16 patients: 2 with [stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45891&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease, 4
with [stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45892&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease, and
10 with [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45893&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
disease.[[19](#cit/section_5.19)] The second report lists 20 patients: 12 with stage II disease and
8 with stage III disease.[[20](#cit/section_5.20)] It is also not clear whether findings from
individual patients were reported twice (i.e., in both trial reports). Patients
with metastatic disease were allowed to enter this trial only if they had a
solitary metastatic tumor.

In the trial, NDV-infected, autologous whole cell vaccines were
administered to patients by intradermal injection beginning 4 weeks after
surgery to remove the primary tumor or the metastatic tumor. Each patient
received a total of 5 vaccinations, 4 given at 10-day intervals and a
final booster given approximately 23 weeks after surgery. One of the study
reports [[19](#cit/section_5.19)] states that 75% of the patients (12 of 16) showed increased
immune system reactivity against uninfected, autologous tumor cells during the
vaccination program. These responses were monitored by injecting uninfected,
irradiated tumor cells into the skin and looking for delayed-type
hypersensitivity responses. [Histologic examination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44834&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
several vaccination sites during the trial showed the presence of infiltrating
immune system cells. These infiltrating cells were composed primarily of
helper T cells; some cytotoxic T cells were also present, but [B cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e.,
antibody-producing cells) were either scarce or absent.[[19](#cit/section_5.19)]

The two phase II trials looked for evidence of
[therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) benefit in patients who
had either metastatic colorectal carcinoma [[15](#cit/section_5.15),[22](#cit/section_5.22)] or locally advanced
colorectal carcinoma.[[16](#cit/section_5.16)] The trial that involved patients with metastatic
disease recruited 23 individuals whose colorectal cancer had recurred in the
liver following treatment of their primary tumor or whose colorectal cancer
and liver metastases were diagnosed at the same time.[[15](#cit/section_5.15),[22](#cit/section_5.22)] After surgery to
remove the primary tumor and/or the metastases, all patients appeared to be
free of residual cancer. NDV-infected, autologous tumor cells were then
administered by intradermal injection every 2 weeks beginning 2 weeks after
surgery. The total number of vaccinations given to the patients in this trial,
however, is not clear. One of the two trial reports indicates that each
patient received four vaccinations and a
[booster](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44583&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which was given approximately
23 weeks after surgery.[[15](#cit/section_5.15)] The second trial report [[22](#cit/section_5.22)] indicates that each
patient received five vaccinations and a booster. No additional treatment
(chemotherapy or radiation therapy) was allowed during the trial.

During 18 months of follow-up, 14 of the 23 (61%) patients in this trial had
relapses of their cancer, compared with relapses in 20 of 23 (87%) historical
control subjects who were treated with surgery alone by the same surgeons at
the same hospital. Although this difference in disease-free survival was
[statistically
significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44167&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), there was no statistically significant difference in overall
survival between the study subjects and the historical control subjects. The
researchers also reported that, in general, the patients who had the strongest
immune system responses against uninfected autologous tumor cells after
vaccination had the longest disease-free survival times. It should be noted,
however, that the reporting of patient responses against uninfected autologous
tumor cells in this trial was inconsistent.[[15](#cit/section_5.15),[22](#cit/section_5.22)] One trial report,[[15](#cit/section_5.15)] which
described results after 12 months of follow-up, indicates that 11 of 23
patients showed increased immune system reactivity against uninfected
autologous tumor cells during the vaccination program; whereas the second
trial report,[[22](#cit/section_5.22)] which described results after 18 months of follow-up,
indicates that only 9 of 23 patients showed increased reactivity against
uninfected autologous tumor cells.

The phase II trial that involved patients with locally advanced colorectal
carcinoma (i.e., large tumors and no regional lymph node metastasis or tumors
of any size and regional lymph nodes that were positive for cancer) recruited
57 individuals.[[16](#cit/section_5.16)] Among these 57 patients, 48 were treated with
NDV-infected, whole cell vaccines, and 9 were treated with vaccines composed
of autologous tumor cells and the
[bacterium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
[Bacillus Calmette Guerin
(BCG)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44581&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which also has been used as an immune system stimulator. Patients
recruited for this trial were treated first with surgery and then were given a
choice between participating in the trial or receiving chemotherapy. The
individuals who chose to participate in the trial were injected intradermally
with the appropriate autologous tumor cell vaccines every other week for a
total of 6 weeks (i.e., 3 vaccinations per patient) beginning 6 to 8 weeks
after surgery. The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 43 months (median
of 22 months), and disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated
for the vaccinated patients and for 661 historical control subjects who were
treated with surgery alone. Two years after surgery, overall survival for the
patients who were treated with NDV-infected, autologous whole cell vaccines
was 98%, compared with 67% overall survival for the patients who were treated
with BCG tumor cell vaccines and 74% overall survival for the historical
control subjects. The differences in survival between the NDV/tumor-cell–vaccinated group and the other two groups were statistically significant.
Disease-free survival 2 years after surgery for the NDV/tumor-cell–treated
patients was 72%. The researchers who conducted this trial also reported that
overall survival for the NDV/tumor-cell–treated group was comparable to that of the group of patients (n = 15) who chose to be treated
with chemotherapy rather than immunotherapy.[[16](#cit/section_5.16)]

Two additional phase II studies investigated the use of NDV-infected,
autologous tumor cell vaccines in patients who had either ovarian cancer or
renal cell cancer.[[21](#cit/section_5.21),[23](#cit/section_5.23)] The ovarian cancer trial enrolled 82 patients, but
only 39 were evaluable for response.[[23](#cit/section_5.23)] The published report of this trial,
however, described clinical findings for just 24 evaluable patients who had
[stage III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45901&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease;
results for the remaining evaluable patients (5 with [stage I](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45899&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease, 5 with
[stage II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45900&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease, and
5 with [stage IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45902&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
disease) were not presented. The patients in this trial were treated with
surgery and six courses of chemotherapy in addition to three courses of
intradermally administered immunotherapy, but details about the adjuvant
treatments (e.g., what constituted a course of immunotherapy or what
chemotherapy drugs were used in addition to [cisplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45230&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) were very limited. Among the
24 evaluable patients with reported clinical findings, 15 had a [complete remission](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45651&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), 8 had a
[partial remission](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45818&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and 1 had
progressive disease. The median disease-free survival time for the patients
who had a complete remission was 30 months. These results were described as
very encouraging by the investigators who conducted the study, but the
degree of benefit afforded by the immunotherapy in this uncontrolled study
cannot be established. In common with other studies of NDV-infected tumor cell
vaccines, histologic examination of individual vaccination sites
revealed the presence of infiltrates consisting predominantly of helper T
cells.[[23](#cit/section_5.23)]

The phase II trial of NDV-infected, autologous tumor cell vaccines
in patients with renal cell cancer enrolled 40 individuals whose disease had
spread from the kidney to at least 1 other organ.[[21](#cit/section_5.21)] The patients in this
trial underwent surgery (i.e., radical nephrectomy) to remove the primary
tumor and then were given intradermal injections of NDV-infected tumor cells
at 3 weeks and 5 weeks after surgery. The patients were also given
subcutaneous injections of low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 and recombinant
interferon-alpha. Five patients had a complete response, and six had a partial
response. After 4 years of follow-up, overall survival for these 11 responding
patients was 100%. Among the remaining 29 patients, 12 had stable disease
(median survival = 31 months) and 17 had progressive disease (median
survival = 14 months). The researchers also reported a median survival time of
13 months for 36 historical control subjects who were
treated with surgery and other types of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, or [hormonal therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The overall
percentage of patients with either a complete response or a partial response
in this uncontrolled study (i.e., 28%) is similar to that found in other
studies in which comparable patients were treated with cytokine therapy but
not vaccine therapy.[[21](#cit/section_5.21)] Therefore, it is not clear whether any of the
apparent clinical benefit in this trial can be attributed to vaccination with
NDV-infected tumor cells.

A fifth phase II clinical trial tested NDV-infected, autologous tumor cell
vaccines in 43 patients who had various advanced cancers (16 ovarian, 22
breast, 1 cervical, 1 [vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), 1 lung,
and 1 [chondrosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45221&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) that had
not responded to previous treatment.[[18](#cit/section_5.18)] The patients in this trial received
intravenous injections of cyclophosphamide and [epirubicin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=523457&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), subcutaneous injections of
low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha, and intradermal
injections of the tumor cell vaccines. The cyclophosphamide and epirubicin
were administered to block the activity of suppressor T cells that might
weaken the desired immune responses. The trial report provided no information
about the treatments that had failed, the time intervals between the failure
of the last treatment and the beginning of immunotherapy, or how many
vaccinations each patient received. The researchers considered 31 of the 43
patients to be evaluable for response. Among the evaluable patients, one
individual who had ovarian cancer had a complete response that lasted more
than 2 months. The remaining evaluable patients had either partial responses
(n = 11), stable disease (n = 10), or progressive disease (n = 9) following
treatment. In view of the limited information given, no conclusions can be
drawn from this uncontrolled study about the effectiveness of NDV-infected,
autologous whole cell vaccines in this patient population.

One additional clinical study evaluated the effect of vaccine quality on
the survival of patients who were treated with NDV-infected, autologous tumor
cells.[[17](#cit/section_5.17)] In this [retrospective study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44956&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
survival was estimated separately for three groups of patients who had early
breast cancer (n = 63), metastatic breast cancer (n = 27), or metastatic ovarian
cancer (n = 31) and who had sufficient numbers of recovered tumor cells to allow
at least two vaccinations. Most of
the patients who had early breast cancer were treated after surgery with
conventional adjuvant therapies (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or
hormonal therapy) in addition to vaccine therapy. The patients who had
metastatic breast or ovarian cancer had failed to respond to conventional
treatments before the start of vaccine therapy. In addition to receiving tumor
cell vaccines, these latter patients were treated with oral [indomethacin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45223&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [cimetidine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45184&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), intravenous cyclophosphamide
and epirubicin, and subcutaneous low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 and
interferon-alpha. The indomethacin, cimetidine, cyclophosphamide, and
epirubicin were given in an attempt to prevent the suppression of desired
immune system responses. The autologous vaccines were classified as either
high quality or low quality on the basis of the following two parameters:
the ratio of tumor cells to other types of cells and the percentage of live
tumor cells. The median times from surgery to the start of immunotherapy were
13 days, 27 days, and 28 days for the patients who had early breast cancer,
metastatic breast cancer, and metastatic ovarian cancer, respectively.

Overall survival 4 years after surgery was estimated to be 96% for the
patients with early breast cancer who had received a high-quality vaccine
(n = 32), compared with an overall survival of 68% for those who
had received a low-quality vaccine (n = 31). For the patients with metastatic
breast cancer, the median survival time was estimated to be 1.75 years from
the start of immunotherapy for those who had received a high-quality vaccine
(n = 13), compared with a median survival time of 0.75 years for those who had
received a low-quality vaccine (n = 14) (median follow-up time = 1.4 years). For
patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, the median survival time was
estimated to be 1.16 years from the start of immunotherapy for those who had
received a high-quality vaccine (n = 18), compared with a median survival time
of 0.84 years for those who had received a low-quality vaccine (n = 13) (median
follow-up time = 1.23 years). The only survival difference that was
statistically significant was the one for the patients who had early breast
cancer. The
[retrospective](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44120&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) nature of this study
and the small numbers of patients in each treatment group should be viewed as
major weaknesses.

In two of the above-mentioned studies, the phase I colorectal cancer study
[[19](#cit/section_5.19),[20](#cit/section_5.20)] and the phase II ovarian cancer study,[[23](#cit/section_5.23)] histologic examination of
several vaccination sites revealed the presence of infiltrating immune system
cells. These infiltrating cells, however, consisted primarily of helper T
cells (CD4 antigen–positive cells); cytotoxic T cells (CD8 antigen–positive
cells) were present, but only as a minor component. In another study,[[27](#cit/section_5.27)]
vaccination sites from five cancer patients (two with colon cancer, two with
melanoma, and one with ovarian cancer) also contained infiltrates of
predominantly helper T cells. In fact, CD8 antigen–positive T cells could not
be detected in the lymphocytes [cultured](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44017&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from vaccination sites of
two of these five patients.[[27](#cit/section_5.27),[22](#cit/section_5.22)] The presence of small numbers
of cytotoxic T cells at vaccination sites may be an important factor to
consider when evaluating the results of the whole cell vaccine trials because
animal studies [[54](#cit/section_5.54)-[57](#cit/section_5.57),[16](#cit/section_5.16),[19](#cit/section_5.19),[58](#cit/section_5.58)-[66](#cit/section_5.66)] and
human studies [[1](#cit/section_5.1)] have suggested that this class of T cells is required for
effective, long-term anticancer immunity. It should also be noted that, in
another study,[[67](#cit/section_5.67)] increases in NK cell activity were measured in
blood samples from two patients with colorectal cancer who exhibited
delayed-type hypersensitivity responses at vaccination sites, but cytotoxic T
cells directed against tumor-specific antigens could not be detected. Overall,
these results indicate that NDV-infected, autologous, whole cell vaccines may
be able to stimulate NK cell activity, which may have contributed
the clinical outcomes described above, but also that these vaccines may
be ineffective in promoting at least one additional immune system response
(i.e., the production of tumor-specific antigen-targeted cytotoxic T cells)
thought to be important to establishing long-term anticancer immunity. Whether
the inclusion of bispecific monoclonal antibodies (refer to the
[Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_30) section of this summary for more information) in the whole cell vaccines will
make them more effective remains to be determined.

### Infection of Patients With NDV (Including Strain MTH-68)

The following information is summarized in [Table 4](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_195) below.

To date, most research into the treatment of human cancer by infection of
patients with NDV has been conducted in Hungary.[[38](#cit/section_5.38),[39](#cit/section_5.39),[41](#cit/section_5.41),[42](#cit/section_5.42),[14](#cit/section_5.14),[49](#cit/section_5.49)-[51](#cit/section_5.51)] The Hungarian research effort has been led by a single group of
investigators who advocate the use of NDV strain MTH-68, which is presumed to
be lytic. Findings from these investigations have been published in the form
of an [anecdotal report](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43995&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
briefly describes results for 3 patients who had metastatic disease;[[41](#cit/section_5.41)] a
single [case report](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about a child who
had [glioblastoma multiforme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45699&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov);[[42](#cit/section_5.42)] a report of a small [case series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44006&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that included 4 individuals with advanced cancer;[[38](#cit/section_5.38)] and a report of a
[placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), phase II
clinical trial that included 33 patients in the NDV treatment group and 26
patients in the [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) group.[[39](#cit/section_5.39)] The
patients in the phase II trial had various advanced cancers.[[39](#cit/section_5.39)] According to
the investigators, MTH-68 treatment was beneficial for the majority of these
patients.

The five patients described in the case report and the small case series
were reported to have had either a complete remission or a partial remission
following NDV therapy.[[38](#cit/section_5.38),[42](#cit/section_5.42)] Two of the patients in the case series had
advanced colorectal cancer, another had melanoma, and the fourth had advanced
Hodgkin disease.[[38](#cit/section_5.38)] These five patients were treated with NDV daily for
periods of time that ranged from 1 month to 7 years. Inhalation and
intravenous injection were the main routes of virus administration. One of the
patients with colorectal cancer, however, was treated by means of [intracolonic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44601&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection (i.e., via a
colostomy opening) for 4 weeks. It is important to note that all five patients
were treated with conventional therapy before the start of NDV therapy and
that four of the five received conventional therapy either
[concurrently](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44011&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with NDV therapy
or after it. Given the small number of patients, the absence of control
subjects, and the overlapping treatments, it is difficult to draw conclusions
about the effectiveness of NDV therapy from these small studies. Nonetheless, taken as a whole the results of the available NDV studies suggest potential clinical value warranting further study with controlled clinical trials.

In the phase II trial,[[39](#cit/section_5.39)] NDV was administered by inhalation only 2 times
a week for a period of 6 months. The 33 patients in the NDV treatment group
had the following types of cancer: colorectal (n = 13), stomach (n = 6), kidney
(n = 3), pancreatic (n = 3), lung (n = 1), breast (n = 1),
ovarian (n = 1), melanoma (n = 1), [bile
duct](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46738&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (n = 1),
[gallbladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46395&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (n = 1),
[sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45562&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(n = 1), and
[ependymoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46432&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (n = 1). The distribution
of cancers among the 26 patients in the placebo group was as follows:
colorectal (n = 5), stomach (n = 3), kidney (n = 6), lung (n = 1), breast (n = 1), melanoma (n = 7), bile duct (n = 1), sarcoma (n = 1), and bladder (n = 1).
Twenty-four (73%) of the patients in the NDV treatment group had distant
metastases when they were recruited into the trial, compared with 22 (85%) of
the patients in the placebo group. Thirty-one (94%) of the patients in the NDV
treatment group received some form of conventional therapy (surgery,
chemotherapy, or radiation therapy) before the start of virus therapy; 9
(29%) of these patients were treated with more than one type of conventional
therapy. All (100%) of the patients in the placebo group received conventional
therapy before the start of virus therapy; 15 (58%) of these individuals were
treated with more than one type of conventional therapy. The average age of
the patients in the NDV treatment group was 62.6 years, compared with an
average age of 55.4 years for the patients in the placebo group. The two
groups, however, were well-balanced with respect to gender distribution (61%
males and 39% females in each treatment group) and average
[performance status](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44174&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (1.39 for
each group, based on the following scale: 0 = free from complaints, 1 = capable of easy work, 2 = less than 50% bed rest required, 3 = more than 50%
bed rest required, 4 = 100% bedridden). Two complete responses and six partial
responses were reported for patients in the NDV treatment group, whereas no
responses were observed in the placebo group. In the NDV treatment group, ten
patients were reported to have stable disease, compared with just two patients
in the placebo group. In addition, more patients in the NDV treatment group
than in the placebo group reported subjective improvements in their
[quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Twenty-two
(67%) of the patients in the NDV treatment group survived at least 1 year,
compared with 4 (15%) of the patients in the placebo group. The 2-year
survival proportions were 21% and 0% for patients in the NDV treatment group
and the placebo group, respectively.

This phase II trial had a number of weaknesses that could have influenced
its outcome. The most important weakness is the fact that the patients were
not randomly assigned to the two treatment groups. This lack of randomization
raises the possibility of
[selection bias](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44087&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In this regard,
it is noteworthy that a larger percentage of patients in the NDV treatment
group than in the placebo group received conventional therapy within the 3
months preceding the initiation of NDV therapy (82% vs. 58%).[[39](#cit/section_5.39)] In fact,
the average time between the completion of conventional therapy and the start
of NDV therapy among the patients who had a either a complete response or a
partial response was 1.8 months.[[39](#cit/section_5.39)] Therefore, the contribution of NDV therapy
to the observed clinical outcomes is difficult to determine.

In a phase I trial that was conducted in the United States, another lytic NDV strain, PV701, was tested in patients with various advanced cancers.[[44](#cit/section_5.44)] In this trial, 79 patients whose tumors had not responded to conventional therapy were given intravenous injections of virus. Four different treatment regimens were evaluated as follows:

1. A single dose of NDV given once every 28 days (17 patients).
2. A single dose of NDV given 3 times during a 1-week period, repeated every 28 days (13 patients).
3. Three injections of NDV given during a 1-week period, with the first injection containing a lower dose of virus than the remaining 2, repeated every 28 days (37 patients).
4. Six injections of NDV given during a 2-week period, with the first injection containing a lower dose of virus than the remaining 5, repeated every 21 days (12 patients).

The researchers found that the use of lower initial doses of virus allowed the administration of higher subsequent doses. A complete response was reported for one patient, and partial tumor regression was observed in eight patients. Thirteen patients had stable disease for periods of time that lasted from 4 months to more than 30 months. Five patients died during the trial: four due to progressive disease and one due, possibly, to a treatment-related complication (refer to the [Adverse Effects](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_116) section of this summary for more information). Several patients experienced significant adverse side effects from NDV treatment, including fever, fatigue, dehydration, low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. Some patients who experienced these adverse effects required hospitalization. The researchers who conducted this trial have indicated that additional clinical studies are under way.

A major concern about the effectiveness of treating cancer patients by
repeated administration of a lytic strain of NDV is the possibility that the
immune system will produce virus-neutralizing antibodies. Virus-neutralizing
antibodies would prevent NDV from reaching and infecting malignant cells,
thereby blocking oncolysis. Impairment of NDV infection would also limit the
ability of cytotoxic T cells that target virus antigens to kill virus-infected
cancer cells. In addition, limiting the infection of cancer cells would lessen
the likelihood that the immune system would become trained to better recognize
tumor-specific antigens. The Hungarian investigators have shown that anti-NDV
antibodies are produced in MTH-68-treated patients,[[38](#cit/section_5.38)] but they apparently
have not determined whether these antibodies are virus-neutralizing. However,
the recent observation that
[immune system tolerance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44598&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
to viruses can be induced by repeated [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) administration of virus proteins suggests
that the concern about virus-neutralizing antibodies may not be entirely
warranted.[[68](#cit/section_5.68),[69](#cit/section_5.69)] It is conceivable that frequent inhalation (or
injection) of NDV may lead to immune system tolerance of this virus. This
possibility should be explored in future studies.

## Adverse Effects

The [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) associated with exposure to [Newcastle disease virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NDV) have generally been
described as mild to moderate in severity. As noted previously
(refer to the [General Information](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq#_5) section of this summary for more information), NDV has been reported to cause
mild flu-like symptoms, [conjunctivitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44197&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [laryngitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44605&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in humans. [[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[10](#cit/section_6.10)]

The most commonly reported side effect after treatment of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients
with the virus alone is fever, which usually subsides within 24
hours.[[2](#cit/section_6.2),[11](#cit/section_6.11),[12](#cit/section_6.12)] In one study of infectious virus, localized [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
such as [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [edema](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45676&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), were
observed in the vicinity of some tumors.[[12](#cit/section_6.12)] These adverse effects may have
contributed to the death of one patient.[[12](#cit/section_6.12)] Other adverse effects reported in this study included [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and [hypoxia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302460&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some of these adverse effects were serious enough to require hospitalization.

Mild headache, mild fever on the day of vaccination,
and itching, swelling, and [erythema](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44589&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at
[injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sites are the most commonly reported side effects following injection of NDV-infected [whole cell vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44923&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[13](#cit/section_6.13)-[17](#cit/section_6.17)]

The only adverse effect associated with administration of NDV [oncolysate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44611&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
[vaccines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inflammation at injection sites.[[18](#cit/section_6.18)-[20](#cit/section_6.20)]

Most of the flu-like symptoms, fever, and edema observed in studies in
which [cytokines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46130&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were combined with NDV oncolysates or whole cell vaccines have
been attributed to treatment with [interleukin-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45256&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[18](#cit/section_6.18)-[22](#cit/section_6.22)]

## Summary of the Evidence for Newcastle Disease Virus

In view of the evidence accumulated, no conclusions can be drawn
about the effectiveness of using [Newcastle disease virus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the treatment of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Most reported
[clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have involved few patients, and [historical control subjects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44596&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
rather than actual [control groups](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have often been used for outcome
comparisons. Poor descriptions of study design and incomplete
reporting of clinical data have hindered evaluation of many of the
reported findings. However, while most studies are small and lack adequate controls, the number of studies suggesting a potential clinical value warrants further attention.

Separate [levels of evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and [scientific](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).
