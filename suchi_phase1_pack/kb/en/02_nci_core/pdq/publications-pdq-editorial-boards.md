# Editorial Boards for PDQ® Cancer Information - NCI

# Editorial Boards for PDQ® Health Professional Cancer Information

The PDQ® Editorial Boards are responsible for producing and maintaining comprehensive, evidence-based cancer information summaries. These summaries are made available to health professionals, patients, researchers, and the general public as a free service of NCI.

## Interdisciplinary Team of Board Members

The six core PDQ Editorial Boards (Adult Treatment, Pediatric Treatment, Screening and Prevention, Supportive and Palliative Care, Cancer Genetics, and Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies) are comprised of specialists in adult and pediatric medical oncology, hematology, radiation oncology, and surgical oncology. Numerous other biomedical disciplines are represented on the Editorial Boards, including pain management and palliative care, cancer prevention, cancer screening, statistics, epidemiology, cancer genetics, psychology and the social sciences, pharmacology, natural products, drug discovery and development, traditional Chinese medicine, and acupuncture.

Each PDQ Editorial Board is supported by a corresponding external Editorial Advisory Board comprised of members with a wide range of expertise in many areas of oncology and other biomedical fields. The Advisory Boards review the PDQ health professional cancer information summaries on a regular basis and make recommendations for changes to be considered by the corresponding core Editorial Board. The PDQ Editorial Advisory Boards do not meet. Board Members come from many parts of the US in addition to international members from Canada, Europe, and Asia. Board Members work across a variety of research and clinical settings both at NCI and at other institutions and are therefore well positioned to provide timely insights from ongoing clinical oncology research.

## Editorial Independence

In developing and maintaining the health professional cancer information summaries, the PDQ Editorial Boards are editorially independent of NCI in that NCI supports but does not intervene in the PDQ editorial processes. Moreover, the PDQ Editorial Boards do not function as formal NCI advisory boards, and they do not formulate policy for the Institute. The diversity and wide range of expertise and multidisciplinary experience available on both the Editorial and the Advisory Boards contributes to the balanced perspective of PDQ.

## Evidence Assessment

The role of the PDQ Editorial Boards is to regularly review the published results of cancer research conducted around the world, assess the strength of the evidence related to the use of specific cancer-related interventions, and summarize their findings. The Boards do not develop clinical practice guidelines or make treatment recommendations.

## Public Service and Transparency

Board members contribute their time and expertise to PDQ as a public service and serve 2-year terms, which are renewable indefinitely, at the discretion of the Chair of the Board. Non-government Board members receive a small honorarium for meeting participation and are reimbursed for their travel and lodging expenses. Government Editorial Board members receive no honoraria for their work with PDQ.

Each Board Member is required to sign a Conflict-of-Interest declaration, recusing themselves from discussions of studies for which they have a potential conflict of interest. Because the PDQ Editorial Boards are not official Federal Advisory Committees, Board members are not asked to disclose specific conflicts.
