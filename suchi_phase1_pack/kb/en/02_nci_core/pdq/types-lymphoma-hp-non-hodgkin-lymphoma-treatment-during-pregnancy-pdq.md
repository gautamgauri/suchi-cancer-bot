## General Information About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment During Pregnancy

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is more common in older patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Hodgkin lymphoma is most common in early adulthood and in patients older than 65 years.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] This age distribution may explain why there are fewer reports of NHL in pregnant patients.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

## Stage Information for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy

To avoid exposure to ionizing radiation, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred tool for staging evaluation.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] For more information, see the [Stage Information for Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](/types/lymphoma/hp/indolent-b-cell-lymphoma-treatment-pdq#_5) section in Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment.

## Treatment of Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy

Treatment may be delayed for women with an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

## Treatment of Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy

### Immediate Therapy

According to anecdotal case series, most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in pregnant patients are aggressive, and delay of therapy until after delivery appears to have poor outcomes.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[4](#cit/section_5.4)] Consequently, some investigators favor immediate therapy, even during pregnancy.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)] In a review of 121 patient case reports from 74 papers, one-half of the patients had very aggressive lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, and one-half of the patients had involvement of the breast, ovaries, uterus, or placenta.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] One-half of the patients received therapy antepartum, and the 6-month survival rate was 53%, with a live-birth rate of 83%.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

A multicenter retrospective analysis of 50 patients described pregnancy termination in 3 patients, deferral of therapy to postpartum in 15 patients (median 30 weeks gestation), and antenatal therapy in the remaining 32 patients (median 21 weeks gestation, all done after the first trimester).[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 53%, and the overall survival rate was 82%, using R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) or modifications of this regimen.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### Early Delivery, When Feasible

For some women, early delivery, when feasible, may minimize or avoid fetal exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

### Termination of Pregnancy

Termination of pregnancy in the first trimester may allow immediate therapy for women with aggressive NHL.

### Effects of Treatment on Children

Evidence (treatment effect on children exposed in utero):

- With follow-up ranging from several months to 11 years, children who were exposed to high-dose doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy in utero (especially during the second and third trimester) had normal growth and no evidence of congenital malformations.[[4](#cit/section_5.4),[7](#cit/section_5.7)-[9](#cit/section_5.9)] For most of the chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of NHL, there are no data regarding long-term effects on children exposed in utero.
- In one anecdotal case, a newborn exposed to a rituximab-containing regimen in utero was born with no circulating B lymphocytes. The newborn was otherwise healthy and recovered the circulating B lymphocytes by age 6 months with no unusual or persisting intercurrent infections.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)]
