### Incidence and Mortality

Transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis accounts for only 7% of all
kidney tumors, and transitional cell cancer of the ureter accounts for only
4% of upper urinary tract tumors. These cancers are curable in more than 90% of patients if
they are superficial and confined to the renal pelvis or ureter. Patients with
deeply invasive tumors that are confined to the renal pelvis or ureter
have a 10% to 15% likelihood of cure. Patients with tumors with penetration
through the urothelial wall or with distant metastases usually cannot be cured
with available forms of treatment.

### Prognosis

The major prognostic factor at
the time of diagnosis of upper tract transitional cell cancer is the depth of
infiltration into or through the uroepithelial wall.

Most superficial tumors are likely to be well differentiated, while infiltrative tumors
are likely to be poorly differentiated. The incidence of
synchronous or metachronous contralateral upper tract cancers ranges from 2% to
4%; the incidence of subsequent bladder cancer after previous upper tract
transitional cell cancer ranges from 30% to 50%.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] When involvement of the
upper tract is diffuse (involving both the renal pelvis and ureter), the
likelihood of subsequent bladder cancer increases to 75%. DNA
ploidy has not added significant prognostic information beyond that provided by
stage and grade.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

### Diagnostics

Even if
ureteroscopy and pyeloscopy are successfully implemented, accurate assessment
of depth of invasion is difficult.

### Treatment Management and Survivorship

Total excision of the ureter
with a bladder cuff, renal pelvis, and kidney is recommended to
provide the greatest likelihood of cure.

## Cellular Classification of Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter

Most upper tract uroepithelial tumors are of transitional cell
histology. Squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the urinary tract makes up less than 15%
of the tumors of the renal pelvis and a smaller percentage of ureteral tumors. SCC is often associated with chronic calculus disease and infection.

Grade of transitional cell cancer of the upper tract has generally been found
to correlate with stage. Superficial tumors are generally grade I or II,
whereas most infiltrative tumors are grades III and IV. Prognosis
is worse for patients with high-grade (grades III and IV) tumors than for those
with low-grade (grades I and II) tumors.

## Stage Information for Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter

Though comparable in many respects to staging systems described for bladder
cancer, unique structural aspects of the renal pelvis and ureter have led to
several differences in the classification schema of tumors that involve the
upper tracts. Clinical staging is based on a combination of radiographic
procedures (e.g., intravenous pyelogram and computed tomographic scans) and,
more recently, ureteroscopy and biopsy.

The advent of rigid and flexible ureteroscopic techniques has permitted
endoscopic access to the ureter and renal pelvis. This may permit greater
accuracy in preoperative definition of the stage and grade of an upper tract
neoplasm. In addition, fulguration and endourological access permit resection
or laser coagulation of highly selected low-stage, low-grade lesions of the
ureters.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] However, this approach is still under clinical evaluation because
there is the possibility of inaccurate assessment of the stage and extent of
disease, and the adequacy and risks of such treatment have not yet been
defined.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)-[5](#cit/section_3.5)]

Because of the inaccessibility of ureteral and pelvic anatomy, accurate staging
requires pathological analysis of the surgically excised specimen.

### AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has designated staging by TNM
(tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)]

Patients may also be designated as having localized, regional, or metastatic
disease, as follows:

**Localized**

Patients with localized disease may be classified into three groups:

- Group 1: Low-grade tumor confined to the urothelium without lamina propria
invasion (*papilloma* grade I transitional cell cancer).
- Group 2: Grade I–III carcinomas without demonstrable subepithelial invasion or
focal microscopic invasion or papillary carcinomas with carcinoma *in situ* and/or carcinoma *in situ* elsewhere in the urothelium.
- Group 3: High-grade tumors that have infiltrated the renal pelvic wall, renal
parenchyma, or both but remain confined to the kidney. Infiltration of
muscle in the upper tract may not be associated with as much potential for
distant dissemination as appears to be the case for bladder cancer.

**Regional**

- Group 4: Extension of tumors beyond the renal pelvis or parenchyma and invasion
of peripelvic and perirenal fat, lymph nodes, hilar vessels, and adjacent
tissues.

**Metastatic**

- Spread of the tumor to distant tissues.

Each of these classifications has been subclassified into categories of
unicentricity or multicentricity. The latter category indicates a more pervasive tumor
diathesis and generally a less favorable prognosis.

Although the classifications listed above have prognostic significance, they
can be determined only at the time of nephroureterectomy, which is the
treatment of choice for patients with this disease. Because of the high
incidence of tumor recurrence within the intramural ureter among patients who
have had incomplete excision of this area, nephroureterectomy includes
the entire ureter and a margin of periureteral orifice mucosa (i.e., bladder cuff).

A TNM staging system has demonstrated accurate
predictions of survival. The TNM staging system may be a better predictor of
prognosis than tumor grade, although both are strongly predictive of survival.
Median survival for patients with tumors confined to the subepithelial
connective tissue was 91.1 months, compared with 12.9 months for patients with
tumors invading the muscularis and beyond, in one report. Flow cytometry analysis
identifies low-stage, low-grade tumors at high risk of recurrence by virtue of
their aneuploid histograms.[[7](#cit/section_3.7),[8](#cit/section_3.8)]

## Treatment Option Overview for Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter

Most patients with renal pelvic transitional cell cancers and
ureteral cancers undergo total nephroureterectomy with
bladder cuff excision. This treatment is because of the rarity of synchronous bilateral renal pelvic neoplasia, the low incidence
of asynchronous development of contralateral upper tract tumors, and the
increased risk of tumor recurrence in the ipsilateral ureter distal to the
original pelvic tumor.

Contemplation of anything less than total excision must take into account the
potential risk for tumor recurrence anywhere in the upper tract unit. In other
than unifocal, low-grade, low-stage renal pelvic tumors, the probable extensive
involvement of both contiguous and noncontiguous sites would appear to make
segmental excision an unnecessary option with a potentially serious risk.
However, an operative possibility includes segmental excision of a particular
lesion. If the extent of a tumor can be determined by intraoperative
assessment and frozen section histological diagnosis confirms a low-grade,
unifocal tumor of limited size, then segmental excision is possible. However,
this approach should be reserved for highly selected patients such as patients with one kidney or those with decreased renal
function who require maximal preservation of renal tissue. The likelihood
of tumor recurrence in this setting, and of extension of disease outside the
renal pelvis once the pelvis has been violated, is a serious risk that must be
heavily weighed in offering a patient this therapeutic option.

Ureteral transitional cell cancer may more readily offer the possibility of
segmental excision if the absence of proximal disease can be documented. In
this setting, attention is focused on the ease of reconstruction of the ureter
and restoration of ureterovesical continuity. This treatment is most feasible if the
cancer is in the distal ureter. If partial ureterectomy is possible and
proximal disease has been excluded, then segmental excision and ureteral
reimplantation can be performed.

Systematic regional lymph node dissection in conjunction with
nephroureterectomy or segmental excision has not been found to enhance the
effectiveness of surgery if tumors are of high grade or high stage because, in
these instances, the overall results are so poor. Correspondingly, lymph node
involvement is uncommon in low-stage disease, and lymphadenectomy is
unlikely to remove additional tumor. Lymph node dissection at the time
of nephrectomy may offer prognostic information, but little, if any,
therapeutic benefit.

## Treatment of Localized Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter

### Treatment Options for Localized Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter

Treatment options for localized transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter include the following:

1. Nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision.
2. Segmental resection of ureter, only if the tumor is superficial and located
in the distal third of the ureter.
3. Electroresection and fulguration or laser fulguration, if the tumor is
superficial (under clinical evaluation).
4. Any parenchymal sparing procedure (segmental resection; ureteroscopic or
percutaneous resection/fulguration/laser destruction), if the renal unit is
solitary or renal function is depressed (under clinical evaluation).
5. Intrapelvic or intraureteral cytotoxic/immunotherapy (under clinical evaluation). The dramatic
success reported with intravesical cytotoxic (thiotepa,
mitomycin, doxorubicin) or immunologic/inflammatory (Bacillus Calmette Guerin [BCG], interferon) therapy
for superficial transitional cell cancers in the bladder has led to the
occasional use of these agents in the treatment of upper tract cancers.
Long-term follow-up of the results of such treatments has generally not been
reported. The efficacy of this approach cannot be assessed, largely because
experience has been limited to patients whose compromised clinical status
(solitary kidney, renal failure, medical risks for surgery) may have influenced
clinical outcome. The use of this approach is limited by the following:

- The extent of
disease in the renal pelvis.
- The access that these agents may have to the area
of disease.
- The sensitivity of the cancer being treated.
- The adequacy and
accuracy of initial tumor staging and continued monitoring.
6. Laser vaporization/coagulation (under clinical evaluation). Transurethral and percutaneous access to
the upper tract have permitted the use of laser therapy in the control of
superficial upper tract transitional cell cancers. This approach is dependent
on accurate staging and adequate visualization of the lesions that need to be
coagulated. Results of this approach are too preliminary to assess.
Therapeutic efficacy, however, will depend on staging accuracy at initial
treatment and the ease of monitoring such patients for disease recurrence and
possible progression.

The development of new instrumentation for endourological treatment of upper
tract transitional cell cancer has provided new options for regional management
of these cancers. Introduction of electrofulguration and resection instruments
or laser probes either transureterally or percutaneously, may permit destruction
of a primary cancer. Introduction of cytotoxic agents has also been used.
Although a biopsy can be taken for staging purposes, its accuracy remains to be determined. The efficacy of treatment by these maneuvers has not
been established.

## Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter

The prognosis for any patient with metastatic or recurrent transitional cell
cancer is poor. The proper management of recurrence depends on the sites of
recurrence, extent of prior therapy, and individual patient considerations.
Chemotherapy regimens that have been effective for metastatic bladder
cancer have generally been applied to transitional cell cancers arising from
other sites. Patients with distant metastases have a poor prognosis and can
be offered treatment in a clinical trial.

In patients with metastatic or recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder, combination chemotherapy has produced high response rates and
occasional complete responses.[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[2](#cit/section_7.2)] Results from a randomized trial that
compared methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) with
single-agent cisplatin in advanced bladder cancer showed a significant advantage
with M-VAC in both response rate and median survival. The overall response
rate with M-VAC in this cooperative group trial was 39%.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)]

Other chemotherapy agents that have shown activity in metastatic transitional
cell cancer include the following:[[4](#cit/section_7.4)-[8](#cit/section_7.8)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Paclitaxel.
- Ifosfamide.
- Gallium nitrate.
- Gemcitabine.
- Pemetrexed.

Ifosfamide, gallium nitrate, and pemetrexed have shown limited activity in
patients previously treated with cisplatin.

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

The lead reviewer for Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter Treatment is:

- Timothy Gilligan, MD (Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute)

Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us"). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/treatment) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
