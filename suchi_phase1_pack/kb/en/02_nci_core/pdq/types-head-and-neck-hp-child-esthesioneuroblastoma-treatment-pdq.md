## Incidence

[Go to Patient Version](/types/head-and-neck/patient/child/esthesioneuroblastoma-treatment-pdq)

Esthesioneuroblastoma (also called olfactory neuroblastoma) is a very rare small round cell tumor arising from the nasal neuroepithelium. Less than 10% of cases occur in children and adolescents.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[2](#cit/section_1.2)] The estimated incidence of esthesioneuroblastoma is 0.1 cases per 100,000 people per year in children younger than 15 years.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] In the pediatric population, the median age is 10 years, and there are no gender or racial predilections.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

Despite its rarity, esthesioneuroblastoma is the most common cancer of the nasal cavity in pediatric patients, accounting for 28% of cases in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program study.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

## Anatomy

[Figure 1](/types/head-and-neck/hp/child/esthesioneuroblastoma-treatment-pdq#_1698) depicts the areas of the body where esthesioneuroblastoma tumors may form, including the olfactory nerve endings, olfactory bulb, nasal cavity, nasal sinuses, and brain.

[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/801515.jpg)![Drawing shows areas of the body where esthesioneuroblastoma tumors may form, including the olfactory nerve endings, olfactory bulb, nasal cavity, nasal sinuses, and brain.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/801515-750.jpg "Drawing shows areas of the body where esthesioneuroblastoma tumors may form, including the olfactory nerve endings, olfactory bulb, nasal cavity, nasal sinuses, and brain.")

Figure 1. Esthesioneuroblastomas form in the olfactory nerve endings in the upper part of the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the brain to the olfactory bulb. Esthesioneuroblastomas may spread from the nasal cavity to the nasal sinuses or to nearby tissue. They may also spread to the brain or to other parts of the body (not shown).

## Clinical Presentation

Most children present with symptoms that may include the following:[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

- Nasal obstruction.
- Epistaxis.
- Hyposmia.
- Exophthalmos.
- Headaches.
- Nasopharyngeal mass, which may have local extension into the orbits, sinuses, or frontal lobe.

## Histology and Molecular Features

Esthesioneuroblastoma can be histologically confused with other small round cell tumors of the nasal cavity, including sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, melanoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Esthesioneuroblastoma typically shows diffuse staining with neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, and chromogranins, with variable cytokeratin expression.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

Nine medical centers obtained 66 samples of olfactory neuroblastoma and tumor samples from other cancers, including alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and sinonasal adenocarcinoma. The tumor samples were analyzed by genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, immunohistochemistry, and next-generation panel sequencing. Unsupervised hierarchal clustering analysis of DNA methylation data identified the following four distinct clusters:[[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

- The largest cluster, which comprised 64% of the samples, had classical histological features of olfactory neuroblastoma. Ten percent of the cases had recurrent *DNMT3A* and *TP53* variants.
- A second cluster consisted of seven cases with a hypermethylator phenotype and *IDH2* variants that clustered with the group of *IDH2* sinonasal carcinomas.
- A small third cluster was characterized by hypermethylation without *IDH2* variants. This result suggests that this cluster may represent a subgroup of olfactory neuroblastomas or an undefined sinonasal tumor entity.
- The fourth cluster represented a heterogenous group of 13 tumors that grouped with other entities such as sinonasal adenocarcinoma, sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma.

Using this information, the authors developed an algorithm that incorporates methylation analysis to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this entity.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

## Prognostic Factors

Review of multiple case series of mainly adult patients indicates that the following may correlate with adverse prognosis:[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[3](#cit/section_5.3)]

- Higher histopathological grade.
- Positive surgical margin status.
- Metastases to the cervical lymph nodes.

## Stage Information for Childhood Esthesioneuroblastoma

Tumors are staged according to the Kadish system (see [Table 1](/types/head-and-neck/hp/child/esthesioneuroblastoma-treatment-pdq#_1231)). Correlated with Kadish stage, survival rates range from 90% (stage A) to less than 40% (stage D). Most patients present with locally advanced–stage disease (Kadish stages B and C). Reports of metastatic disease (Kadish stage D) vary among studies and is described at rates of 20% to 30%.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[6](#cit/section_6.6)]

Reports suggest that positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) may aid in staging the disease.[[7](#cit/section_6.7)]

Table 1. Kadish Staging System

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A | Tumor confined to the nasal cavity. |
| B | Tumor extending to the nasal sinuses. |
| C | Tumor extending to the nasal sinuses and beyond. |
| D | Tumor metastases present. |

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)] Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Ophthalmologists.
- Rehabilitation
specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[[2](#cit/section_7.2)] At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families. Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)-[5](#cit/section_7.5)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[[6](#cit/section_7.6)] The U.S. [Rare Diseases Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf "https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf") defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.

The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[[7](#cit/section_7.7),[8](#cit/section_7.8)] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:

- A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[[9](#cit/section_7.9)]
- The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[[10](#cit/section_7.10)] These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[4](#cit/section_7.4)]

Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

## Treatment of Childhood Esthesioneuroblastoma

The use of multimodal therapy optimizes the chances for survival, with more than 70% of children expected to survive 5 or more years after initial diagnosis.[[1](#cit/section_8.1)-[5](#cit/section_8.5)] Neuromeningeal progression is the most common type of treatment failure.[[5](#cit/section_8.5),[6](#cit/section_8.6)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Treatment options according to Kadish stage include the following:[[7](#cit/section_8.7)]

1. **Kadish stage A:**
Surgery alone with clear margins. Adjuvant radiation therapy is indicated in patients with close and positive margins or with residual disease.
2. **Kadish stage B:**
Surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial.
3. **Kadish stage C:**
Neoadjuvant approach with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery.
4. **Kadish stage D:**
Systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy to local and metastatic sites.

The mainstay of treatment is surgery and radiation therapy. However, esthesioneuroblastoma is a chemosensitive neoplasm, and the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can facilitate resection.[[5](#cit/section_8.5),[7](#cit/section_8.7)-[9](#cit/section_8.9)] Endoscopic sinus surgery offers short-term outcomes similar to open craniofacial resection.[[10](#cit/section_8.10)]; [[11](#cit/section_8.11)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Other techniques such as [stereotactic radiosurgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46701&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=NotSet) and proton-beam therapy ([charged-particle radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=534234&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=NotSet)) may also play a role in the management of this tumor.[[3](#cit/section_8.3),[12](#cit/section_8.12),[13](#cit/section_8.13)]

Routine neck dissection and nodal exploration are not indicated in the absence of clinical or radiological evidence of disease.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)] Management of cervical lymph node metastases has been addressed in a review article.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)]

Reports have indicated promising results with the increased use of resection and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced-stage disease.[[2](#cit/section_8.2),[5](#cit/section_8.5),[15](#cit/section_8.15)-[17](#cit/section_8.17)]; [[18](#cit/section_8.18)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Chemotherapy regimens that have been used with efficacy include the following:

- Cisplatin and etoposide with or without ifosfamide.[[19](#cit/section_8.19),[20](#cit/section_8.20)]
- Vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide with or without doxorubicin.
- Ifosfamide and etoposide.
- Cisplatin plus etoposide or doxorubicin.[[2](#cit/section_8.2)]
- Vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.[[21](#cit/section_8.21)]
- Irinotecan plus docetaxel.[[22](#cit/section_8.22)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

The lead reviewers for Childhood Esthesioneuroblastoma Treatment are:

- Denise Adams, MD (Children's Hospital Boston)
- Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber of Boston Children's Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Harvard Medical School)
- William H. Meyer, MD
- Paul A. Meyers, MD (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center)
- Thomas A. Olson, MD (Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston Campus)
- Alberto S. Pappo, MD (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)
- D. Williams Parsons, MD, PhD (Texas Children's Hospital)
- Arthur Kim Ritchey, MD (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC)
- Carlos Rodriguez-Galindo, MD (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital)
