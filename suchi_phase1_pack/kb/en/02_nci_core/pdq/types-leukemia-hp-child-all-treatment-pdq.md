## General Information About Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)

[Go to Patient Version](/types/leukemia/patient/child-all-treatment-pdq)

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence of childhood cancer, including ALL, has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved in children and adolescents with cancer.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)-[3](#cit/section_1.3)] Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%, although cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease past infancy among children in the United States.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[2](#cit/section_1.2),[4](#cit/section_1.4),[5](#cit/section_1.5)] For ALL, the 5-year survival rate increased over the same time, from 60% to approximately 90% for children younger than 15 years, and from 28% to more than 75% for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[2](#cit/section_1.2),[3](#cit/section_1.3),[6](#cit/section_1.6)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

### Incidence

ALL, the most common cancer diagnosed in children, represents approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children younger than 15 years.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)] In the United States, ALL occurs at an annual rate of approximately 40 cases per 1 million people aged 0 to 14 years and approximately 20 cases per 1 million people aged 15 to 19 years.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] Approximately 3,100 children and adolescents younger than 20 years are diagnosed with ALL each year in the United States.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)] Since 1975, there has been a gradual increase in the incidence of ALL.[[2](#cit/section_1.2),[9](#cit/section_1.9)]

A sharp peak in ALL incidence is observed among children aged 1 to 4 years (76.3 cases per 1 million per year), with rates decreasing to 23.8 cases per 1 million by age 10 years.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] The incidence of ALL among children aged 1 to 4 years is approximately fourfold greater than that for infants and for children aged 10 years and older.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

The incidence of ALL appears to be highest in American Indian or Alaska Native children and adolescents (43.9 cases per 1 million) and Hispanic children and adolescents (46.8 cases per 1 million).[[3](#cit/section_1.3),[10](#cit/section_1.10)] The incidence is substantially higher in White children than in Black children, with a twofold higher incidence of ALL from age 1 to 4 years in White children than in Black children.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

### Anatomy

Childhood ALL originates in the T and B lymphoblasts in tissues with hematopoietic progenitor cells, such as the bone marrow and thymus (see [Figure 1](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_610)). [Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/526538.jpg)![Blood cell development; drawing shows the steps a blood stem cell goes through to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell, a platelet, or a myeloblast, which then becomes a granulocyte (the types of granulocytes are eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils). A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then becomes a B-lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte, or natural killer cell.](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/526538-750.jpg "Blood cell development; drawing shows the steps a blood stem cell goes through to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell, a platelet, or a myeloblast, which then becomes a granulocyte (the types of granulocytes are eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils). A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then becomes a B-lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte, or natural killer cell.")

Figure 1. Blood cell development. Different blood and immune cell lineages, including T and B lymphocytes, differentiate from a common blood stem cell.

Marrow involvement of acute leukemia as seen by light microscopy is defined as follows:

- M1: Fewer than 5% blast cells.
- M2: 5% to 25% blast cells.
- M3: Greater than 25% blast cells.

Almost all patients with ALL present with an M3 marrow.

### Morphology

In the past, ALL lymphoblasts were classified using
the French-American-British (FAB) criteria as having L1, L2, or L3 morphology.[[11](#cit/section_1.11)] However, it is no longer used because of the lack of independent prognostic
significance and the subjective nature of this classification system.

Most cases of ALL that show L3 morphology express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) and have a *MYC* gene translocation identical to those seen in Burkitt lymphoma (i.e., t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(2;8)) that join *MYC* to one of the Ig genes. Patients with this specific rare form of leukemia (mature B-cell or Burkitt leukemia) should be treated according to protocols for Burkitt lymphoma. For
more information about the treatment of mature B-cell lymphoma/leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, see [Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq). Rarely, blasts with L1/L2 (not L3) morphology will express surface Ig.[[12](#cit/section_1.12)] These patients should be treated in the same way as patients with B-ALL.[[12](#cit/section_1.12)]

### Risk Factors for Developing ALL

The primary accepted risk factors for ALL and associated genes (when relevant) include the following:

- Prenatal exposure to x-rays.
- Postnatal exposure to high doses of radiation (e.g., therapeutic radiation previously used for conditions such as tinea capitis and thymus enlargement).
- Previous treatment with chemotherapy.
- Genetic conditions that include the following:

- Down syndrome. For more information, see the [Down syndrome](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_62) section.
- Neurofibromatosis (*NF1*).[[13](#cit/section_1.13)]
- Bloom syndrome (*BLM*).[[14](#cit/section_1.14)]
- Fanconi anemia (multiple genes; ALL is observed much less frequently than acute myeloid leukemia [AML]).[[15](#cit/section_1.15)]
- Ataxia telangiectasia (*ATM*).[[16](#cit/section_1.16),[17](#cit/section_1.17)]
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome (*TP53*).[[18](#cit/section_1.18)-[20](#cit/section_1.20)]
- Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (biallelic variant of *MLH1*, *MSH2*, *MSH6*, and *PMS2*).[[21](#cit/section_1.21),[22](#cit/section_1.22)]
- Low- and high-penetrance inherited genetic variants.[[23](#cit/section_1.23)] For more information, see the [Low- and high-penetrance inherited genetic variants](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_67) section.
- Carriers of a constitutional Robertsonian translocation that involves chromosomes 15 and 21 and carriers of constitutional ring chromosome 21 are specifically and highly predisposed to developing intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) ALL.[[24](#cit/section_1.24),[25](#cit/section_1.25)]

#### Down syndrome

Children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing both ALL and AML,[[26](#cit/section_1.26)-[28](#cit/section_1.28)] with a cumulative risk of developing leukemia of approximately 2.1% by age 5 years and 2.7% by age 30 years.[[26](#cit/section_1.26),[28](#cit/section_1.28)] These rates represent a 20- to 30-fold increased risk of ALL and over 100-fold increased risk of AML for children with Down syndrome.[[27](#cit/section_1.27),[28](#cit/section_1.28)]

A genome-wide association study found that four susceptibility loci associated with B-ALL in the non-Down syndrome population (*IKZF1*, *CDKN2A*, *ARID5B*, and *GATA3*) were also associated with susceptibility to ALL in children with Down syndrome.[[29](#cit/section_1.29)] *CDKN2A* risk allele penetrance appeared to be higher for children with Down syndrome.

Approximately one-half to two-thirds of cases of acute leukemia in children with Down syndrome are ALL, and about 2% to 3% of childhood ALL cases occur in children with Down syndrome.[[30](#cit/section_1.30)-[33](#cit/section_1.33)] ALL in children with Down syndrome has an age distribution similar to that of ALL in children without Down syndrome, with a median age of 3 to 4 years.[[30](#cit/section_1.30),[31](#cit/section_1.31)] In contrast, nearly all cases of AML in children with Down syndrome occur before the age of 4 years (median age, 1 year).[[34](#cit/section_1.34)]

Patients with ALL and Down syndrome have a lower incidence of both favorable (*ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion and hyperdiploidy [51–65 chromosomes]) and unfavorable (*BCR*::*ABL1* or *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusions and hypodiploidy [<44 chromosomes]) genomic alterations and a near absence of T-cell phenotype.[[30](#cit/section_1.30)-[32](#cit/section_1.32),[34](#cit/section_1.34),[35](#cit/section_1.35)]

Approximately 50% to 60% of cases of ALL in children with Down syndrome have genomic alterations affecting *CRLF2* that generally result in overexpression of the protein produced by this gene, which dimerizes with the interleukin-7 receptor alpha to form the receptor for the cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin.[[36](#cit/section_1.36)-[38](#cit/section_1.38)] The *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* fusion occurs much more commonly than the *IGH*::*CRLF2* fusion in children with Down syndrome, particularly in those of younger age.[[38](#cit/section_1.38),[39](#cit/section_1.39)] *CRLF2* genomic alterations are observed at a much lower frequency (<10%) in children with B-ALL who do not have Down syndrome; when they do occur, they are more often associated with the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like subtype.[[38](#cit/section_1.38),[40](#cit/section_1.40),[41](#cit/section_1.41)] In one retrospective study, the frequency of *CRLF2* rearrangements was nine times higher in children with Down syndrome and ALL than in children with ALL but without Down syndrome (54.2% vs. 6.0%). In that study, only 25% of the cases with *CRLF2* rearrangements and Down syndrome were classified as *BCR*::*ABL1*-like, compared with 54% of cases with *CRLF2* rearrangements without Down syndrome.[[42](#cit/section_1.42)]

Based on the relatively small number of published series, it does not appear that genomic *CRLF2* aberrations in patients with Down syndrome and ALL have prognostic relevance.[[35](#cit/section_1.35),[37](#cit/section_1.37)] However, among patients with Down syndrome and *CRLF2* rearrangements, those with the *BCR*::*ABL1* signature appear to have a worse prognosis than those who do not have the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion.[[42](#cit/section_1.42)]

Approximately 20% to 30% of ALL cases arising in children with Down syndrome have somatically acquired *JAK1* or *JAK2* variants,[[36](#cit/section_1.36),[37](#cit/section_1.37),[42](#cit/section_1.42)-[45](#cit/section_1.45)] which are strongly associated with the presence of *CRLF2* rearrangements.[[36](#cit/section_1.36)-[38](#cit/section_1.38),[42](#cit/section_1.42)] *JAK* variants are uncommon among younger children with ALL who do not have Down syndrome but are observed more frequently in older children and adolescents with high-risk B-ALL, particularly in those with the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like subtype.[[46](#cit/section_1.46)] Preliminary evidence suggests no correlation between *JAK2* variant status and 5-year event-free survival (EFS) in children with Down syndrome and ALL.[[37](#cit/section_1.37),[44](#cit/section_1.44)]

*IKZF1* gene deletions, observed in 20% to 35% of patients with Down syndrome and ALL, have been associated with a significantly worse outcome in this group of patients.[[37](#cit/section_1.37),[47](#cit/section_1.47),[48](#cit/section_1.48)]

Approximately 10% of patients with Down syndrome and ALL have genomic alterations leading to overexpression or abnormal activation of the *CEBPD*, *CEBPA*, and *CEBPE* genes.[[42](#cit/section_1.42)] Of the *CEBP*-activated cases with ALL and Down syndrome, approximately 40% also have *FLT3* single nucleotide variants or insertions/deletions, compared with 4.1% in cases with Down syndrome and other ALL subtypes.

#### Low- and high-penetrance inherited genetic variants

Genetic predisposition to ALL can be divided into several broad categories, as follows:

- **Association with genetic syndromes.** Increased risk can be associated with the genetic syndromes listed [above](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_644) in which ALL is observed, although it is not the primary manifestation of the condition.
- **Common alleles.** Another category for genetic predisposition includes common alleles with relatively small effect sizes that are identified by genome-wide association studies. Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of germline (inherited) genetic polymorphisms that are associated with the development of childhood ALL.[[23](#cit/section_1.23)] For example, the risk alleles of *ARID5B* are associated with the development of hyperdiploid (51–65 chromosomes) B-ALL. *ARID5B* is a gene that encodes a transcriptional factor important in embryonic development, cell type–specific gene expression, and cell growth regulation.[[49](#cit/section_1.49),[50](#cit/section_1.50)] Other genes with polymorphisms associated with increased risk of ALL include *GATA3*,[[51](#cit/section_1.51)] *IKZF1*,[[49](#cit/section_1.49),[50](#cit/section_1.50),[52](#cit/section_1.52)] *CDKN2A*,[[53](#cit/section_1.53)] *CDKN2B*,[[52](#cit/section_1.52),[53](#cit/section_1.53)] *CEBPE*,[[49](#cit/section_1.49)] *PIP4K2A*,[[51](#cit/section_1.51),[54](#cit/section_1.54)] and *TP63*.[[55](#cit/section_1.55)]

Genetic risk factors for T-ALL share some overlap with the genetic risk factors for B-ALL, but unique risk factors also exist. A genome-wide association study identified a risk allele near *USP7* that was associated with an increased risk of developing T-ALL (odds ratio, 1.44) but not B-ALL. The risk allele was shown to be associated with reduced *USP7* transcription, which is consistent with the finding that somatic loss-of-function variants in *USP7* are observed in patients with T-ALL. *USP7* germline and somatic variants are generally mutually exclusive and are most commonly observed in T-ALL patients with *TAL1* alterations.[[56](#cit/section_1.56)]

Genetic risk factors that have similar impact for developing both B-ALL and T-ALL include *CDKN2A*, *CDKN2B*, and 8q24.21 (*cis* distal enhancer region variants for *MYC*).[[56](#cit/section_1.56)]
- **Rare germline variants with high penetrance.** Germline variants that cause pathogenic changes in genes associated with ALL and that are observed in kindreds with familial ALL (i.e., large effect sizes) comprise another category of genetic predisposition to ALL. Many of the genes associated with ALL risk play key roles in B-cell development (e.g., *PAX5*, *ETV6*, and *IKZF1*).[[57](#cit/section_1.57)]

- ***PAX5***. A germline pathogenic variant in *PAX5* that substitutes serine for glycine at amino acid 183 and that reduces *PAX5* activity has been identified in several families that experienced multiple cases of ALL.[[58](#cit/section_1.58),[59](#cit/section_1.59)]
- ***ETV6***. Several germline *ETV6* pathogenic variants that lead to loss of ETV6 function have been identified in kindreds affected by both thrombocytopenia and ALL.[[60](#cit/section_1.60)-[64](#cit/section_1.64)] Sequencing of *ETV6* in remission (i.e., germline) specimens identified variants that were potentially related to ALL in approximately 1% of children with ALL that were evaluated.[[60](#cit/section_1.60)] Most of the germline pathogenic variants (approximately 75%) were shown to be deleterious for *ETV6* function, and 70% of cases with a deleterious germline *ETV6* pathogenic variant had a hyperdiploid karyotype. The remaining cases with a deleterious variant had diploid ALL, with a transcriptional profile similar to that of cases with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion–positive ALL.[[64](#cit/section_1.64)]
- ***TP53***. Germline *TP53* pathogenic variants are associated with an increased risk of ALL.[[65](#cit/section_1.65)] A study of 3,801 children with ALL observed that 26 patients (0.7%) had a germline *TP53* pathogenic variant, with an associated odds ratio of 5.2 for ALL development.[[65](#cit/section_1.65)] Compared with ALL in children with *TP53* wild-type status or *TP53* variants of unknown significance, ALL in children with germline *TP53* pathogenic variants was associated with older age at diagnosis (15.5 years vs. 7.3 years), hypodiploidy (65% vs. 1%), inferior EFS and overall survival, and a higher risk of second cancers.
- ***IKZF1***. Germline *IKZF1* pathogenic variants were identified in a kindred with familial ALL and in 43 of 4,963 (0.9%) children with sporadic ALL. Most (22 of 28) *IKZF1* variants were shown to adversely affect *IKZF1* gene function.[[66](#cit/section_1.66)] Germline pathogenic variants in *IKZF1* have been identified in hereditary hypogammaglobulinemia. In one series, 2 of 29 affected patients developed B-ALL during childhood.[[67](#cit/section_1.67)]

#### Prenatal origin of childhood ALL

Development of ALL is a multistep process in most cases, with more than one genomic alteration required for frank leukemia to develop. In at least some cases of childhood ALL, the initial genomic alteration occurs in utero. Evidence to support this comes from the observation that the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor antigen rearrangements that are unique to each patient’s leukemia cells can be detected in blood samples obtained at birth.[[68](#cit/section_1.68),[69](#cit/section_1.69)] Similarly, in ALL characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities, some patients have blood cells that carry at least one leukemic genomic abnormality at the time of birth, with additional cooperative genomic changes acquired postnatally.[[68](#cit/section_1.68)-[70](#cit/section_1.70)] Genomic studies of identical twins with concordant leukemia further support the prenatal origin of some leukemias.[[68](#cit/section_1.68),[71](#cit/section_1.71)]

Evidence also exists that some children who never develop ALL are born with rare blood cells carrying a genomic alteration associated with ALL. Initial studies focused on the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* translocation and used reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify RNA transcripts indicating the presence of the gene fusion. For example, in one study, 1% of neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards) tested positive for the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* translocation.[[72](#cit/section_1.72)] While subsequent reports generally confirmed the presence of the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* translocation at birth in some children, rates and extent of positivity varied widely.

To more definitively address this question, a highly sensitive and specific DNA-based approach (genomic inverse PCR for exploration of ligated breakpoints) was applied to DNA from 1,000 cord blood specimens and found that 5% of specimens had the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* translocation.[[73](#cit/section_1.73)] When the same method was applied to 340 cord blood specimens to detect the *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion, two cord specimens (0.6%) were positive for its presence.[[74](#cit/section_1.74)] For both *ETV6*::*RUNX1* and *TCF3*::*PBX1*, the percentage of cord blood specimens positive for one of the translocations far exceeds the percentage of children who will develop either type of ALL (<0.01%).

### Clinical Presentation

The typical and atypical symptoms and clinical findings of childhood ALL have been published.[[75](#cit/section_1.75)-[77](#cit/section_1.77)]

### Diagnosis

The evaluation needed to definitively diagnose childhood ALL has been published.[[75](#cit/section_1.75)-[79](#cit/section_1.79)]

### Overall Prognosis

Among children with ALL, approximately 98% attain remission. Approximately 85% of patients aged 1 to 18 years with newly diagnosed ALL treated on current regimens are expected to be long-term event-free survivors, with more than 90% of patients alive at 5 years.[[80](#cit/section_1.80)-[83](#cit/section_1.83)] In one study of patients with newly diagnosed ALL, relapses were rare (occurring in fewer than 1% of patients) by 6 to 7 years after diagnosis.[[84](#cit/section_1.84)] In addition, the excess risk of death associated with the leukemia diagnosis had decreased such that the mortality rate of the surviving patients at 6 to 7 years after diagnosis was similar to that of the general population.

Cytogenetic and genomic findings combined with minimal residual disease (MRD) results can define subsets of ALL with EFS rates exceeding 95% and, conversely, subsets with EFS rates of 50% or lower. For more information, see the sections on [Cytogenetics/Genomics of Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2077) and [Prognostic Factors Affecting Risk-Based Treatment](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_580).

Despite the treatment advances in childhood ALL, numerous important biological and therapeutic questions remain to be answered before the goal of curing every child with ALL with the least associated toxicity can be achieved. The systematic investigation of these issues requires large clinical trials, and the opportunity to participate in these trials is offered to most patients and families.

Clinical trials for children and adolescents with ALL are generally designed to compare therapy that is currently accepted as standard with investigational regimens that seek to improve cure rates and/or decrease toxicity. In certain trials in which the cure rate for the patient group is very high, therapy reduction questions may be asked. Much of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for childhood ALL and other childhood cancers has been achieved through investigator-driven discovery and tested in carefully randomized, controlled, multi-institutional clinical trials. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

### 2016 WHO Classification of Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage

For acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, the group of acute leukemias that have characteristics of both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the WHO classification system is summarized in [Table 1](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2090).[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3)] The criteria for lineage assignment for a diagnosis of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) are provided in [Table 2](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2091).[[4](#cit/section_2.4)]

Table 1. Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage According to the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissuesa

| Condition | Definition |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| MPAL = mixed phenotype acute leukemia; NOS = not otherwise specified. | |
| aAdapted from Béné MC: Biphenotypic, bilineal, ambiguous or mixed lineage: strange leukemias! Haematologica 94 (7): 891-3, 2009.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)] Obtained from Haematologica/the Hematology Journal website [http://www.haematologica.org](http://www.haematologica.org "http://www.haematologica.org"). | |
| Acute undifferentiated leukemia | Acute leukemia that does not express any marker considered specific for either lymphoid or myeloid lineage |
| MPAL with *BCR*::*ABL1* (t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)) | Acute leukemia meeting the diagnostic criteria for mixed phenotype acute leukemia in which the blasts also have the (9;22) translocation or the *BCR*::*ABL1* rearrangement |
| MPAL with *KMT2A* rearranged (t(v;11q23)) | Acute leukemia meeting the diagnostic criteria for mixed phenotype acute leukemia in which the blasts also have a translocation involving the *KMT2A* gene |
| MPAL, B/myeloid, NOS (B/M MPAL) | Acute leukemia meeting the diagnostic criteria for assignment to both B and myeloid lineage, in which the blasts lack genetic abnormalities involving *BCR*::*ABL1* or *KMT2A* |
| MPAL, T/myeloid, NOS (T/M MPAL) | Acute leukemia meeting the diagnostic criteria for assignment to both T and myeloid lineage, in which the blasts lack genetic abnormalities involving *BCR*::*ABL1* or *KMT2A* |
| MPAL, B/myeloid, NOS—rare types | Acute leukemia meeting the diagnostic criteria for assignment to both B and T lineage |
| Other ambiguous lineage leukemias | Natural killer–cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma |

Table 2. Lineage Assignment Criteria for Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia According to the 2016 Revision to the World Health Organization Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemiaa

| Lineage | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| aAdapted from Arber et al.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] | |
| bStrong defined as equal to or brighter than the normal B or T cells in the sample. | |
| **Myeloid lineage** | Myeloperoxidase (flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or cytochemistry); **or** monocytic differentiation (at least two of the following: nonspecific esterase cytochemistry, CD11c, CD14, CD64, lysozyme) |
| **T lineage** | Strongb cytoplasmic CD3 (with antibodies to CD3 epsilon chain); **or** surface CD3 |
| **B lineage** | Strongb CD19 with at least one of the following strongly expressed: CD79a, cytoplasmic CD22, or CD10; **or** weak CD19 with at least two of the following strongly expressed: CD79a, cytoplasmic CD22, or CD10 |

Leukemias of mixed phenotype may be seen in various presentations, including the following:

1. Bilineal leukemias in which there are two distinct populations of cells, usually one lymphoid and one myeloid.
2. Biphenotypic leukemias in which individual blast cells display features of both lymphoid and myeloid lineage.

Biphenotypic cases represent most of the mixed phenotype leukemias.[[5](#cit/section_2.5)]
Patients with B-myeloid biphenotypic leukemias lacking the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion have lower rates of complete remission (CR) and significantly worse event-free survival (EFS) rates compared with patients with B-ALL.[[5](#cit/section_2.5)] Cases of MPAL (B/myeloid) that have *ZNF384* gene fusions have been reported,[[6](#cit/section_2.6),[7](#cit/section_2.7)] and a genomic evaluation of MPAL found that *ZNF384* gene fusions were present in approximately one-half of B/myeloid cases.[[8](#cit/section_2.8)]

Some studies suggest that patients with biphenotypic leukemia may fare better with a lymphoid, as opposed to a myeloid, treatment regimen.[[9](#cit/section_2.9)-[12](#cit/section_2.12)]; [[13](#cit/section_2.13)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] A large retrospective study from the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster group demonstrated that initial therapy with an ALL-type regimen was associated with a superior outcome compared with AML-type or combined ALL/AML regimens, particularly in cases with CD19 positivity or other lymphoid antigen expression. In this study, hematopoietic stem cell transplant in first CR was not beneficial, with the possible exception of cases with morphological evidence of persistent marrow disease (≥5% blasts) after the first month of treatment.[[12](#cit/section_2.12)]

For more information about key clinical and biological characteristics, as well as the prognostic significance for these entities, see the [Cytogenetics/Genomics of Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2077) section.

The genomics of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been extensively investigated, and multiple distinctive subtypes have been defined on the basis of cytogenetic and molecular characterizations, each with its own pattern of clinical and prognostic characteristics.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] The discussion of the genomics of childhood ALL below is divided into three sections: the genomic alterations associated with B-ALL, followed by the genomic alterations associated with T-ALL and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). Figures 2, 3, and 5
illustrate the distribution of B-ALL (stratified by National Cancer Institute [NCI] standard- and high-risk B-ALL) and T-ALL cases by cytogenetic/molecular subtypes.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

Throughout this section, the percentages of genomic subtypes from among all B-ALL and T-ALL cases are derived primarily from a report describing the genomic characterization of patients treated on several Children's Oncology Group (COG) and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) clinical trials. Percentages by subtype are presented for NCI standard-risk and NCI high-risk patients with B-ALL (up to age 18 years).[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

### B-ALL cytogenetics/genomics

B-ALL is typified by genomic alterations that include: 1) gene fusions that lead to aberrant activity of transcription factors, 2) chromosomal gains and losses (e.g., hyperdiploidy or hypodiploidy), and 3) alterations leading to activation of tyrosine kinase genes.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Figures 2 and 3
illustrate the distribution of NCI standard-risk and high-risk B-ALL cases by 23 cytogenetic/molecular subtypes.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The two most common subtypes (hyperdiploid and *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion) together account for approximately 60% of NCI standard-risk B-ALL cases, but only approximately 25% of NCI high-risk cases. Most other subtypes are much less common, with most occurring at frequencies less than 2% to 3% of B-ALL cases. The molecular and clinical characteristics of some of the subtypes are discussed below.

Figure 3. Genomic subtypes and frequencies of NCI high-risk B-ALL. The figure represents data from 1,084 children diagnosed with NCI high-risk B-ALL (aged 1–18 years and WBC >50,000/µL) and enrolled in St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital or Children’s Oncology Group clinical trials. Adapted from Supplemental Table 2 of Brady SW, Roberts KG, Gu Z, et al.: The genomic landscape of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nature Genetics 54: 1376-1389, 2022.

The genomic landscape of B-ALL is characterized by a range of genomic alterations that disrupt normal B-cell development and, in some cases, by variants in genes that provide a proliferation signal (e.g., activating variants in *RAS* family genes or variants/translocations leading to kinase pathway signaling). Genomic alterations leading to blockage of B-cell development include translocations (e.g., *TCF3*::*PBX1* and *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusions), single nucleotide variants (e.g., *IKZF1* and *PAX5*), and intragenic/intergenic deletions (e.g., *IKZF1*, *PAX5*, *EBF*, and *ERG*).[[3](#cit/section_3.3)]

The genomic alterations in B-ALL tend not to occur at random, but rather to cluster within subtypes that can be delineated by biological characteristics such as their gene expression profiles. Cases with recurring chromosomal translocations (e.g., *TCF3*::*PBX1* and *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusions and *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL) have distinctive biological features and illustrate this point, as do the examples below of specific genomic alterations within unique biological subtypes:

- *IKZF1* deletions and variants are most commonly observed within cases of *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL and *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL.[[4](#cit/section_3.4),[5](#cit/section_3.5)]
- Intragenic *ERG* deletions occur within a distinctive subtype characterized by gene rearrangements involving *DUX4*.[[6](#cit/section_3.6),[7](#cit/section_3.7)]
- *TP53* variants, often germline and pathogenic, occur at high frequency in patients with low hypodiploid ALL with 32 to 39 chromosomes.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] *TP53* variants are uncommon in other patients with B-ALL.

Activating single nucleotide variants in kinase genes are uncommon in high-risk B-ALL. *JAK* genes are the primary kinases that are found to be altered. These variants are generally observed in patients with *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL who have *CRLF2* abnormalities, although *JAK2* variants are also observed in approximately 25% of children with Down syndrome and ALL, occurring exclusively in cases with *CRLF2* gene rearrangements.[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[9](#cit/section_3.9)-[11](#cit/section_3.11)] Several kinase genes and cytokine receptor genes are activated by translocations, as described below in the discussion of *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL and *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL. *FLT3* variants occur in a minority of cases (approximately 10%) of hyperdiploid ALL and *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL, and are rare in other subtypes.[[12](#cit/section_3.12)]

Understanding of the genomics of B-ALL at relapse is less advanced than the understanding of ALL genomics at diagnosis. Childhood ALL is often polyclonal at diagnosis and under the selective influence of therapy, some clones may be extinguished and new clones with distinctive genomic profiles may arise.[[13](#cit/section_3.13)] However, molecular subtype–defining lesions such as translocations and aneuploidy are almost always retained at relapse.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[13](#cit/section_3.13)] Of particular importance are new variants that arise at relapse that may be selected by specific components of therapy. As an example, variants in *NT5C2* are not found at diagnosis, whereas specific variants in *NT5C2* were observed in 7 of 44 (16%) and 9 of 20 (45%) cases of B-ALL with early relapse that were evaluated for this variant in two studies.[[13](#cit/section_3.13),[14](#cit/section_3.14)] *NT5C2* variants are uncommon in patients with late relapse, and they appear to induce resistance to mercaptopurine and thioguanine.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)] Another gene that is found altered only at relapse is *PRSP1*, a gene involved in purine biosynthesis.[[15](#cit/section_3.15)] Variants were observed in 13.0% of a Chinese cohort and 2.7% of a German cohort, and were observed in patients with on-treatment relapses. The *PRSP1* variants observed in relapsed cases induce resistance to thiopurines in leukemia cell lines. *CREBBP* variants are also enriched at relapse and appear to be associated with increased resistance to glucocorticoids.[[13](#cit/section_3.13),[16](#cit/section_3.16)] With increased understanding of the genomics of relapse, it may be possible to tailor upfront therapy to avoid relapse or detect resistance-inducing variants early and intervene before a frank relapse.

Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been shown to have prognostic significance, especially in B-ALL. Some chromosomal alterations are associated with more favorable outcomes, such as favorable trisomies (51–65 chromosomes) and the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion.[[17](#cit/section_3.17)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Other alterations historically have been associated with a poorer prognosis, including the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion (Philadelphia chromosome–positive [Ph+]; t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)), rearrangements of the *KMT2A* gene, hypodiploidy, and intrachromosomal amplification of the *RUNX1* gene (iAMP21).[[18](#cit/section_3.18)]

In recognition of the clinical significance of many of these genomic alterations, the 5th edition revision of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours lists the following entities for B-ALL:[[19](#cit/section_3.19)]

- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, NOS.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with high hyperdiploidy.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with hypodiploidy.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with iAMP21.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *BCR*::*ABL1*-like features.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *KMT2A* rearrangement.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *ETV6*::*RUNX1*-like features.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *IGH*::*IL3* fusion.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion.
- B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with other defined genetic abnormalities.

The category of B-ALL with other defined genetic abnormalities includes potential novel entities, including B-ALL with *DUX4*, *MEF2D*, *ZNF384* or *NUTM1* rearrangements; B-ALL with *IG*::*MYC* fusions; and B-ALL with *PAX5*alt or PAX5 p.P80R (NP\_057953.1) abnormalities.

These and other chromosomal and genomic abnormalities for childhood ALL are described below.

1. **Chromosome number.**

- **High hyperdiploidy (51–65 chromosomes).**

High hyperdiploidy, defined as 51 to 65 chromosomes per cell or a DNA index greater than 1.16, occurs in approximately 33% of NCI standard-risk and 14% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[20](#cit/section_3.20)]
Hyperdiploidy can be evaluated by measuring the DNA content of cells (DNA
index) or by karyotyping. In cases with a normal karyotype or in which standard cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful, interphase fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (FISH) may detect hidden hyperdiploidy.

High hyperdiploidy generally occurs in cases with
clinically favorable prognostic factors (patients aged 1 to <10 years with a low white blood cell [WBC] count) and is an independent favorable prognostic factor.[[20](#cit/section_3.20)-[22](#cit/section_3.22)] Within the hyperdiploid range of 51 to 65 chromosomes, patients with higher modal numbers (58–66) appeared to have a better prognosis in one study.[[22](#cit/section_3.22)] Hyperdiploid leukemia cells are particularly susceptible to undergoing apoptosis and accumulate higher levels of methotrexate and its active polyglutamate metabolites,[[23](#cit/section_3.23)] which may explain the favorable outcome commonly observed in these cases.

While the overall outcome of patients with high hyperdiploidy is considered to be favorable, factors such as age, WBC count, specific trisomies, and early response to treatment have been shown to modify its prognostic significance.[[24](#cit/section_3.24)-[26](#cit/section_3.26)]

Multiple reports have described the prognostic significance of specific chromosome trisomies among children with hyperdiploid B-ALL.

- A study combining experience from the Children's Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) found that patients with trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 (triple trisomies) have a particularly favorable outcome.[[27](#cit/section_3.27)]; [[17](#cit/section_3.17)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- A report using POG data found that NCI standard-risk patients with trisomies of 4 and 10, without regard to chromosome 17 status, have an excellent prognosis.[[28](#cit/section_3.28)] COG protocols currently use double trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10 to define favorable hyperdiploidy.
- A retrospective analysis evaluated patients treated on two consecutive UKALL trials to identify and validate a profile to predict outcome in high hyperdiploid B-ALL. The investigators defined a good-risk group (approximately 80% of high hyperdiploidy patients) that was associated with a more favorable prognosis. Good-risk patients had either trisomies of both chromosomes 17 and 18 or trisomy of one of these two chromosomes along with absence of trisomies of chromosomes 5 and 20. All other patients were defined as poor risk and had a less favorable outcome. End-induction MRD and copy number alterations (such as *IKZF1* deletion) were prognostically significant within each hyperdiploid risk group.[[29](#cit/section_3.29)]

Chromosomal translocations may be seen with high hyperdiploidy, and in those cases, patients are more appropriately risk-classified on the basis of the prognostic significance of the translocation. For instance, in one study, 8% of patients with the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion also had high hyperdiploidy,[[30](#cit/section_3.30)] and the outcome of these patients (treated without tyrosine kinase inhibitors) was inferior to that observed in non-*BCR*::*ABL1* high hyperdiploid patients.

Certain patients with hyperdiploid ALL may have a hypodiploid clone that has doubled (masked hypodiploidy).[[31](#cit/section_3.31)] Molecular technologies, such as single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays to detect widespread loss of heterozygosity, can be used to identify patients with masked hypodiploidy.[[31](#cit/section_3.31)] These cases may be interpretable based on the pattern of gains and losses of specific chromosomes (hyperdiploidy with two and four copies of chromosomes rather than three copies). These patients have an unfavorable outcome, similar to those with hypodiploidy.[[32](#cit/section_3.32)]

Near triploidy (68–80 chromosomes) and near tetraploidy (>80 chromosomes) are much less common and appear to be biologically distinct from high hyperdiploidy.[[33](#cit/section_3.33)] Unlike high hyperdiploidy, a high proportion of near tetraploid cases harbor a cryptic *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion.[[33](#cit/section_3.33)-[35](#cit/section_3.35)] Near triploidy and tetraploidy were previously thought to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis, but later studies suggest that this may not be the case.[[33](#cit/section_3.33),[35](#cit/section_3.35)]

The genomic landscape of hyperdiploid ALL is characterized by variants in genes of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS pathway in approximately one-half of cases. Genes encoding histone modifiers are also present in a recurring manner in a minority of cases. Analysis of variant profiles demonstrates that chromosomal gains are early events in the pathogenesis of hyperdiploid ALL and may occur *in utero*, while variants in RTK/RAS pathway genes are late events in leukemogenesis and are often subclonal.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[36](#cit/section_3.36)]
- **Hypodiploidy (<44 chromosomes).**

B-ALL cases with fewer than the normal number of chromosomes have been subdivided in various ways, with one report stratifying on the basis of modal chromosome number into the following four groups:[[32](#cit/section_3.32)]

- Near-haploid: 24 to 29 chromosomes (n = 46).
- Low-hypodiploid: 33 to 39 chromosomes (n = 26).
- High-hypodiploid: 40 to 43 chromosomes (n = 13).
- Near-diploid: 44 chromosomes (n = 54).

Near-haploid cases represent approximately 2% of NCI standard-risk and 2% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

Low-hypodiploid cases represent approximately 0.5% of NCI standard-risk and 2.6% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

Most patients with hypodiploidy are in the near-haploid and low-hypodiploid groups, and both of these groups have an elevated risk of treatment failure compared with nonhypodiploid cases.[[32](#cit/section_3.32),[37](#cit/section_3.37)] Patients with fewer than 44 chromosomes have a worse outcome than do patients with 44 or 45 chromosomes in their leukemic cells.[[32](#cit/section_3.32)] Several studies have shown that patients with high minimal residual disease (MRD) (≥0.01%) after induction do very poorly, with 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates ranging from 25% to 47%. Although hypodiploid patients with low MRD after induction fare better (5-year EFS rates, 64%–75%), their outcomes are still inferior to most children with other types of ALL.[[38](#cit/section_3.38)-[40](#cit/section_3.40)]

The recurring genomic alterations of near-haploid and low-hypodiploid ALL appear to be distinctive from each other and from other types of ALL.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] In near-haploid ALL, alterations targeting RTK signaling, RAS signaling, and *IKZF3* are common.[[41](#cit/section_3.41)] In low-hypodiploid ALL, genetic alterations involving *TP53*, *RB1*, and *IKZF2* are common. Importantly, the *TP53* alterations observed in low-hypodiploid ALL are also present in nontumor cells in approximately 40% of cases, suggesting that these variants are germline pathogenic and that low-hypodiploid ALL represents, in some cases, a manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] Approximately two-thirds of patients with ALL and germline *TP53* pathogenic variants have hypodiploid ALL.[[42](#cit/section_3.42)]
2. **Chromosomal translocations and gains/deletions of chromosomal segments.**

- ***ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion (t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1)).**

Fusion of the *ETV6* gene on
chromosome 12 to the *RUNX1* gene on chromosome 21 is present in approximately 27% of NCI standard-risk and 10% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[34](#cit/section_3.34)]

The *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion produces a cryptic translocation that is detected by methods such as FISH, rather than conventional cytogenetics, and it occurs most commonly in children aged 2 to 9 years.[[43](#cit/section_3.43),[44](#cit/section_3.44)] Hispanic children with ALL have a lower incidence of *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusions than do White children.[[45](#cit/section_3.45)]

Reports generally indicate favorable EFS and overall survival (OS) rates in children with the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion; however, the prognostic impact of this genetic feature is modified by the following factors:[[26](#cit/section_3.26),[46](#cit/section_3.46)-[50](#cit/section_3.50)]; [[17](#cit/section_3.17)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Early response to treatment.
- NCI risk category (age and WBC count at diagnosis).
- Treatment regimen.

In one study of the treatment of newly diagnosed children with ALL, multivariate analysis of prognostic factors found age and leukocyte count, but not *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion status, to be independent prognostic factors.[[46](#cit/section_3.46)] However, another large trial only enrolled patients classified as having favorable-risk B-ALL, with low-risk clinical features, either trisomies of 4, 10, and 17 or *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion, and end induction MRD less than 0.01%. Patients had a 5-year continuous complete remission rate of 93.7% and a 6-year OS rate of 98.2% for patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1*.[[17](#cit/section_3.17)] It does not appear that the presence of secondary cytogenetic abnormalities, such as deletion of *ETV6* (12p) or *CDKN2A/B* (9p), impacts the outcome of patients with the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion.[[50](#cit/section_3.50),[51](#cit/section_3.51)]

There is a higher frequency of late relapses in patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusions compared with other relapsed B-ALL patients.[[46](#cit/section_3.46),[52](#cit/section_3.52)] Patients with the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion who relapse seem to have a better outcome than other relapse patients,[[53](#cit/section_3.53)] with an especially favorable prognosis for patients who relapse more than 36 months from diagnosis.[[54](#cit/section_3.54)] Some relapses in patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusions may represent a new independent second hit in a persistent preleukemic clone (with the first hit being the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* translocation).[[55](#cit/section_3.55),[56](#cit/section_3.56)]
- ***BCR*::*ABL1* fusion (t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2); Ph+).**

The *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion leads to production of a BCR::ABL1 fusion protein with tyrosine kinase activity (see Figure 4).[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion occurs in approximately 2% of NCI standard-risk and 5% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion is also the leukemogenic driver for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The most common *BCR* breakpoint in CML is different from the most common *BCR* breakpoint in ALL. The breakpoint that typifies CML produces a larger fusion protein (termed p210) than the breakpoint most commonly observed for ALL (termed p190, a smaller fusion protein).[Enlarge](https://nci-media.cancer.gov/pdq/media/images/533336.jpg)![Philadelphia chromosome; three-panel drawing shows a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 breaking off and trading places, creating a changed chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia chromosome.

Figure 4. The Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation between the *ABL1* oncogene (on the long arm of chromosome 9) and the *BCR* gene (on the long arm of chromosome 22), resulting in the fusion gene *BCR*::*ABL1*. *BCR*::*ABL1* encodes an oncogenic protein with tyrosine kinase activity.

Ph+ ALL is more common in older children with B-ALL and high WBC counts, with the incidence of the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusions increasing to about 25% in young adults with ALL.

Historically, the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion was associated with an extremely poor prognosis (especially in those who presented with a high WBC count or had a slow early response to initial therapy), and its presence had been considered an indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients in first remission.[[30](#cit/section_3.30),[57](#cit/section_3.57)-[59](#cit/section_3.59)] Inhibitors of the BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase, such as imatinib mesylate, are effective in patients with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL.[[60](#cit/section_3.60)] A study by the Children's Oncology Group (COG), which used intensive chemotherapy and concurrent imatinib mesylate given daily, demonstrated a 5-year EFS rate of 70% (± 12%), which was superior to the EFS rate of historical controls in the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate) era. This result eliminated the recommendation of HSCT for patients with a good early response to chemotherapy using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.[[61](#cit/section_3.61),[62](#cit/section_3.62)]

The International Consensus Classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma from 2022 divides *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL into two subtypes: cases with lymphoid-only involvement and cases with multilineage involvement.[[63](#cit/section_3.63)] These subtypes differ in the timing of their transformation event. A multipotent progenitor serves as the target cell of origin for *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL with multilineage involvement, and a later progenitor is the target cell of origin for *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL with lymphoid-only involvement.

- *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL with lymphoid-only involvement is the predominate subtype. Only a minority of cases in children and adults have multilineage involvement (estimated at 15%–30%).[[64](#cit/section_3.64)]
- *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL cases with lymphoid-only involvement and cases with multilineage involvement have similar clinical presentations and immunophenotypes. In addition, both subtypes commonly have the p190 fusion protein.[[64](#cit/section_3.64),[65](#cit/section_3.65)]
- One way of distinguishing between patients with lymphoid-only and multilineage involvement is to detect the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion in normal non-ALL B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells.[[65](#cit/section_3.65)]
- A second way of distinguishing between patients with lymphoid-only and multilineage involvement is to detect quantitative differences in MRD levels (typically 1 log) using measures that quantify *BCR*::*ABL1* DNA or RNA, compared with measures based on flow cytometry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) quantitation of leukemia-specific immunoglobulin (IG) or T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements.[[64](#cit/section_3.64)-[66](#cit/section_3.66)]

- For patients with lymphoid-only *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL, MRD estimates for these methods will be correlated with each other.
- For patients with multilineage involvement *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL, posttreatment MRD estimates based on detection of *BCR*::*ABL1* DNA or RNA will often be higher than estimates based on flow cytometry or quantitation of leukemia-specific IG/TCR rearrangements.
- For patients with *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL and multilineage involvement, levels of *BCR*::*ABL1* transcripts and DNA may remain stable over time despite continued treatment with chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In these situations, the persisting *BCR*::*ABL1* DNA or RNA likely represents evidence of a residual preleukemic clone and not leukemia cells. Therefore, the term MRD is a misnomer.
- A corollary of the difference in MRD detection by methods based on *BCR*::*ABL1* DNA or RNA detection versus MRD detection based on flow cytometry or IG/TCR rearrangements is that the latter methods provide more reliable prognostication.[[64](#cit/section_3.64),[66](#cit/section_3.66),[67](#cit/section_3.67)] For example, the presence of MRD by *BCR*::*ABL1* DNA or RNA detection in the absence of MRD detection by IG/TCR rearrangements does not confer inferior prognosis.
- Based on the limited numbers of patients studied to date, prognosis appears similar in both adults and children with lymphoid-only versus multilineage involvement *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL.[[64](#cit/section_3.64),[66](#cit/section_3.66)]
- There are case reports of patients with multilineage involvement *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL who relapse years from their initial diagnosis. In addition, their relapsed leukemia has the same *BCR*::*ABL1* breakpoint as their initial leukemia, but it has a different IG/TCR rearrangement.[[66](#cit/section_3.66)] These case reports suggest that patients with multilineage *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL are at risk of a second leukemogenic event, leading to a second *BCR*::*ABL1* leukemia.
- There is no evidence that a specific monitoring schedule or prolonged treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor provides clinical benefit for patients with multilineage involvement *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive B-ALL who have maintained presence of *BCR*::*ABL1* transcripts or DNA at the completion of a standard-duration course of leukemia therapy.

Rearrangements involving the *KMT2A* gene with more than 100 translocation partner genes result in the production of fusion oncoproteins. *KMT2A* gene rearrangements occur in up to 80% of infants with ALL. Beyond infancy, approximately 1% of NCI standard-risk and 4% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases have *KMT2A* rearrangements.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

These rearrangements are generally associated with an increased risk of treatment failure, particularly in infants.[[68](#cit/section_3.68)-[71](#cit/section_3.71)] The *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusion (t(4;11)(q21;q23)) is the most common rearrangement involving
the *KMT2A* gene in children with ALL and occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of childhood ALL.[[69](#cit/section_3.69),[72](#cit/section_3.72)]

Patients with *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusions are usually infants with high WBC counts. These patients are more likely than other children with ALL to have central nervous system (CNS) disease and to
have a poor response to initial therapy.[[73](#cit/section_3.73)] While both infants and adults
with the *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusion are at high risk of treatment failure, children with the
*KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusion appear to have a better outcome.[[68](#cit/section_3.68),[69](#cit/section_3.69),[74](#cit/section_3.74)] Irrespective of the type of *KMT2A* gene rearrangement, infants with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL have much worse event-free survival rates than non-infant pediatric patients with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL.[[68](#cit/section_3.68),[69](#cit/section_3.69),[74](#cit/section_3.74)]

Whole-genome sequencing has determined that cases of infant ALL with *KMT2A* gene rearrangements have frequent subclonal *NRAS* or *KRAS* variants and few additional genomic alterations, none of which have clear clinical significance.[[12](#cit/section_3.12),[75](#cit/section_3.75)] Deletion of the *KMT2A* gene has not been associated with an adverse prognosis.[[76](#cit/section_3.76)]

Of interest, the *KMT2A*::*MLLT1* fusion (t(11;19)(q23;p13.3)) occurs in approximately 1% of ALL cases and occurs in both early B-lineage
ALL and T-ALL.[[77](#cit/section_3.77)] Outcome for infants with the *KMT2A*::*MLLT1* fusion is poor, but outcome
appears relatively favorable in older children with T-ALL and the *KMT2A*::*MLLT1* fusion.[[77](#cit/section_3.77)]
- ***TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion (t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)) and *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion (t(17;19)(q22;p13)).**

Fusion of the *TCF3* gene on
chromosome 19 to the *PBX1* gene on chromosome
1 is present in approximately 4% of NCI standard-risk and 5% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[78](#cit/section_3.78),[79](#cit/section_3.79)] The *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion may occur as either a balanced translocation or as an
unbalanced translocation and is the primary recurring genomic alteration of the pre-B–ALL immunophenotype (cytoplasmic immunoglobulin positive).[[80](#cit/section_3.80)] Black children are relatively more likely than White children to have pre-B–ALL with the *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion.[[81](#cit/section_3.81)]

The *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion had been associated with inferior outcome in the context of antimetabolite-based therapy,[[82](#cit/section_3.82)] but the adverse prognostic significance was largely negated by more aggressive multiagent therapies.[[79](#cit/section_3.79),[83](#cit/section_3.83)] More specifically, in a trial conducted by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) in which all patients were treated without cranial radiation, patients with the *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion had an overall outcome comparable to children lacking this translocation, but with a higher risk of CNS relapse and a lower rate of bone marrow relapse, suggesting that more intensive CNS therapy may be needed for these patients.[[84](#cit/section_3.84),[85](#cit/section_3.85)]

The *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion occurs in less than 1% of pediatric ALL cases. ALL with the *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and hypercalcemia at diagnosis. Outcome is very poor for children with the *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion, with a literature review noting mortality for 20 of 21 cases reported.[[86](#cit/section_3.86)] In addition to the *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion, the genomic landscape of this ALL subtype was characterized by deletions in genes involved in B-cell development (*PAX5*, *BTG1*, and *VPREB1*) and by variants in RAS pathway genes (*NRAS*, *KRAS*, and *PTPN11*).[[80](#cit/section_3.80)]
- ***DUX4*-rearranged ALL with frequent *ERG* deletions.**

Approximately 3% of NCI standard-risk and 6% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL patients have a rearrangement involving *DUX4* that leads to its overexpression.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[6](#cit/section_3.6),[7](#cit/section_3.7)] East Asian ancestry was linked to an increased prevalence of *DUX4*-rearranged ALL (favorable).[[87](#cit/section_3.87)] The most common rearrangement produces *IGH*::*DUX4* fusions, with *ERG*::*DUX4* fusions also observed.[[88](#cit/section_3.88)] *DUX4*-rearranged cases show a distinctive gene expression pattern that was initially identified as being associated with focal deletions in *ERG*,[[88](#cit/section_3.88)-[91](#cit/section_3.91)] and one-half to more than two-thirds of these cases have focal intragenic deletions involving *ERG* that are not observed in other ALL subtypes.[[6](#cit/section_3.6),[88](#cit/section_3.88)] *ERG* deletions often appear to be clonal, but using sensitive detection methodology, it appears that most cases are polyclonal.[[88](#cit/section_3.88)] *IKZF1* alterations are observed in 20% to 40% of *DUX4*-rearranged ALL.[[6](#cit/section_3.6),[7](#cit/section_3.7)]

*ERG* deletion connotes an excellent prognosis, with OS rates exceeding 90%. Even when the *IZKF1* deletion is present, prognosis remains highly favorable.[[89](#cit/section_3.89)-[92](#cit/section_3.92)] While patients with *DUX4*-rearranged ALL have an overall favorable prognosis, there is uncertainty as to whether this applies to both *ERG*-deleted and *ERG*-intact cases. In a study of 50 patients with *DUX4*-rearranged ALL, patients with an *ERG* deletion detected by genomic PCR (n = 33) had a more favorable EFS rate of approximately 90% than did patients with intact *ERG* (n = 17), with an EFS rate of approximately 70%.[[90](#cit/section_3.90)]
- ***MEF2D*-rearranged ALL.**

Gene fusions involving *MEF2D*, a transcription factor that is expressed during B-cell development, are observed in approximately 0.3% of NCI standard-risk and 3% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[93](#cit/section_3.93),[94](#cit/section_3.94)]

Although multiple fusion partners may occur, most cases involve *BCL9*, which is located on chromosome 1q21, as is *MEF2D*.[[93](#cit/section_3.93),[95](#cit/section_3.95)] The interstitial deletion producing the *MEF2D*::*BCL9* fusion is too small to be detected by conventional cytogenetic methods. Cases with *MEF2D* gene fusions show a distinctive gene expression profile, except for rare cases with *MEF2D*::*CSFR1* that have a *BCR*::*ABL1*-like gene expression profile.[[93](#cit/section_3.93),[96](#cit/section_3.96)]

The median age at diagnosis for cases of *MEF2D*-rearranged ALL in studies that included both adult and pediatric patients was 12 to 14 years.[[93](#cit/section_3.93),[94](#cit/section_3.94)] For 22 children with *MEF2D*-rearranged ALL enrolled in a high-risk ALL clinical trial, the 5-year EFS rate was 72% (standard error, ± 10%), which was inferior to that for other patients.[[93](#cit/section_3.93)]
- ***ZNF384*-rearranged ALL.**

*ZNF384* is a transcription factor that is rearranged in approximately 0.3% of NCI standard-risk and 2.7% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[93](#cit/section_3.93),[97](#cit/section_3.97),[98](#cit/section_3.98)]

East Asian ancestry was associated with an increased prevalence of *ZNF384*.[[87](#cit/section_3.87)] Multiple fusion partners for *ZNF384* have been reported, including *ARID1B*, *CREBBP*, *EP300*, *SMARCA2*, *TAF15*, and *TCF3*. Regardless of the fusion partner, *ZNF384*-rearranged ALL cases show a distinctive gene expression profile.[[93](#cit/section_3.93),[97](#cit/section_3.97),[98](#cit/section_3.98)] *ZNF384* rearrangement does not appear to confer independent prognostic significance.[[93](#cit/section_3.93),[97](#cit/section_3.97),[98](#cit/section_3.98)] However, within the subset of patients with *ZNF384* rearrangements, patients with *EP300*::*ZNF384* fusions have lower relapse rates than patients with other *ZNF384* fusion partners.[[99](#cit/section_3.99)] The immunophenotype of B-ALL with *ZNF384* rearrangement is characterized by weak or negative CD10 expression, with expression of CD13 and/or CD33 commonly observed.[[97](#cit/section_3.97),[98](#cit/section_3.98)] Cases of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) (B/myeloid) that have *ZNF384* gene fusions have been reported,[[100](#cit/section_3.100),[101](#cit/section_3.101)] and a genomic evaluation of MPAL found that *ZNF384* gene fusions were present in approximately one-half of B/myeloid cases.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)]
- ***NUTM1*-rearranged B-ALL.**

*NUTM1*-rearranged B-ALL is most commonly observed in infants, representing 3% to 5% of overall cases of B-ALL in this age group and approximately 20% of infant B-ALL cases lacking the *KMT2A* rearrangement.[[103](#cit/section_3.103)] The frequency of *NUTM1* rearrangement is lower in children after infancy (<1% of cases).[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[103](#cit/section_3.103)]

The *NUTM1* gene is located on chromosome 15q14, and some cases of B-ALL with *NUTM1* rearrangements show chromosome 15q aberrations, but other cases are cryptic and have no cytogenetic abnormalities.[[104](#cit/section_3.104)] RNA sequencing, as well as break-apart FISH, can be used to detect the presence of the *NUTM1* rearrangement.[[103](#cit/section_3.103)]

The *NUTM1* rearrangement appears to be associated with a favorable outcome.[[103](#cit/section_3.103),[105](#cit/section_3.105)] Among 35 infants with *NUTM1*-rearranged B-ALL who were treated on Interfant protocols, all patients achieved remission and no relapses were observed.[[103](#cit/section_3.103)] For the 32 children older than 12 months with *NUTM1*-rearranged B-ALL, the 4-year EFS and OS rates were 92% and 100%, respectively.
- ***IGH*::*IL3* fusion (t(5;14)(q31.1;q32.3)).**

This entity is included in the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.[[106](#cit/section_3.106)] The finding of t(5;14)(q31.1;q32.3) in patients with ALL and hypereosinophilia in the 1980s was followed by the identification of the *IGH*::*IL3* fusion as the underlying genetic basis for the condition.[[107](#cit/section_3.107),[108](#cit/section_3.108)] The joining of the *IGH* locus to the promoter region of the *IL3* gene leads to dysregulation of *IL3* expression.[[109](#cit/section_3.109)] Cytogenetic abnormalities in children with ALL and eosinophilia are variable, with only a subset resulting from the *IGH*::*IL3* fusion.[[110](#cit/section_3.110)]

The number of cases of *IGH*::*IL3* ALL described in the published literature is too small to assess the prognostic significance of the *IGH*::*IL3* fusion. Diagnosis of cases of *IGH*::*IL3* ALL may be delayed because the ALL clone in the bone marrow may be small, and because it can present with hypereosinophilia in the absence of cytopenias and circulating blasts.[[106](#cit/section_3.106)]
- **Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21).**

iAMP21 occurs in approximately 5% of NCI standard-risk and 7% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] iAMP21 is generally diagnosed using FISH and is defined by the presence of greater than or equal to five RUNX1 signals per cell (or ≥3 extra copies of *RUNX1* on a single abnormal chromosome).[[106](#cit/section_3.106)] iAMP21 can also be identified by chromosomal microarray analysis. Uncommonly, iAMP21 with an atypical genomic pattern (e.g., amplification of the genomic region but with less than 5 RUNX1 signals or having at least 5 RUNX1 signals with some located apart from the abnormal iAMP21-chromosome) is identified by microarray but not RUNX1 FISH.[[111](#cit/section_3.111)] The prognostic significance of iAMP21 defined only by microarray has not been characterized.

iAMP21 is associated with older age (median, approximately 10 years), presenting WBC count of less than 50 × 109/L, a slight female preponderance, and high end-induction MRD.[[112](#cit/section_3.112)-[114](#cit/section_3.114)] Analysis of variant signatures indicates that gene amplifications in iAMP21 occur later in leukemogenesis, which is in contrast to those of hyperdiploid ALL that can arise early in life and even *in utero*.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

The United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (UKALL) clinical trials group initially reported that the presence of iAMP21 conferred a poor prognosis in patients treated in the MRC ALL 97/99 trial (5-year EFS rate, 29%).[[18](#cit/section_3.18)] In their subsequent trial ([UKALL2003 [NCT00222612]](/clinicaltrials/NCT00222612)), patients with iAMP21 were assigned to a more intensive chemotherapy regimen and had a markedly better outcome (5-year EFS rate, 78%).[[113](#cit/section_3.113)] Similarly, the COG has reported that iAMP21 was associated with a significantly inferior outcome in NCI standard-risk patients (4-year EFS rate, 73% for iAMP21 vs. 92% in others), but not in NCI high-risk patients (4-year EFS rate, 73% vs. 80%).[[112](#cit/section_3.112)] On multivariate analysis, iAMP21 was an independent predictor of inferior outcome only in NCI standard-risk patients.[[112](#cit/section_3.112)] The results of the UKALL2003 and COG studies suggest that treatment of iAMP21 patients with high-risk chemotherapy regimens abrogates its adverse prognostic significance and obviates the need for HSCT in first remission.[[114](#cit/section_3.114)]
- ***PAX5* alterations.**

Gene expression analysis identified two distinctive ALL subsets with *PAX5* genomic alterations, called *PAX5*alt and PAX5 p.P80R (NP\_057953.1).[[115](#cit/section_3.115)] The alterations in the *PAX5*alt subtype included rearrangements, sequence variants, and focal intragenic amplifications.

***PAX5*alt.** *PAX5* rearrangements have been reported to represent approximately 3% of NCI standard-risk and 11% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] More than 20 partner genes for *PAX5* have been described,[[115](#cit/section_3.115)] with *PAX5*::*ETV6*, the primary genomic alteration in dic(9;12)(p13;p13),[[116](#cit/section_3.116)] being the most common gene fusion.[[115](#cit/section_3.115)]

Intragenic amplification of *PAX5* was identified in approximately 1% of B-ALL cases, and it was usually detected in cases lacking known leukemia-driver genomic alterations.[[117](#cit/section_3.117)] Cases with *PAX5* amplification show male predominance (66%), with most (55%) having NCI high-risk status. For a cohort of patients with *PAX5* amplification diagnosed between 1993 and 2015, the 5-year EFS rate was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%–61%), and the OS rate was 67% (95% CI, 54%–77%), suggesting a relatively poor prognosis for patients with this B-ALL subtype.

**PAX5 p.P80R (NP\_057953.1).** PAX5 with a p.P80R variant shows a gene expression profile distinctive from that of other cases with *PAX5* alterations.[[115](#cit/section_3.115)] Cases with PAX5 p.P80R represent approximately 0.3% of NCI standard-risk and 1.8% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] PAX5 p.P80R B-ALL appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) and adult populations (3.1% and 4.2%, respectively).[[115](#cit/section_3.115)]

Outcome for the pediatric patients with PAX5 p.P80R and *PAX5*alt treated in a COG clinical trial appears to be intermediate (5-year EFS rate, approximately 75%).[[115](#cit/section_3.115)] *PAX5*alt rearrangements have also been detected in infant patients with ALL, with a reported outcome similar to *KMT2A*-rearranged infant ALL.[[105](#cit/section_3.105)]
- ***BCR*::*ABL1*-like (Ph-like).**

*BCR*::*ABL1*-negative patients with a gene expression profile similar to *BCR*::*ABL1*-positive patients have been referred to as Ph-like,[[118](#cit/section_3.118)-[120](#cit/section_3.120)] and are now referred to as *BCR*::*ABL1*-like.[[19](#cit/section_3.19)] This occurs in 10% to 20% of pediatric B-ALL patients, increasing in frequency with age, and has been associated with an
*IKZF1* deletion or variant.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[9](#cit/section_3.9),[118](#cit/section_3.118),[119](#cit/section_3.119),[121](#cit/section_3.121),[122](#cit/section_3.122)]

Retrospective analyses have indicated that patients with *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL have a poor prognosis.[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[118](#cit/section_3.118)] In one series, the 5-year EFS rate for NCI high-risk children and adolescents with *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL was 58% and 41%, respectively.[[5](#cit/section_3.5)] While it is more frequent in older and higher-risk patients, the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like subtype has also been identified in NCI standard-risk patients. In a COG study, 13.6% of 1,023 NCI standard-risk B-ALL patients were found to have *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL; these patients had an inferior EFS rate compared with non–*BCR*::*ABL1*-like standard-risk patients (82% vs. 91%), although no difference in OS rate (93% vs. 96%) was noted.[[123](#cit/section_3.123)] In one study of 40 *BCR*::*ABL1*-like patients, the adverse prognostic significance of this subtype appeared to be abrogated when patients were treated with risk-directed therapy on the basis of MRD levels.[[124](#cit/section_3.124)]

The hallmark of *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL is activated kinase signaling, with approximately 35% to 50% containing *CRLF2* genomic alterations [[1](#cit/section_3.1),[120](#cit/section_3.120),[125](#cit/section_3.125)] and half of those cases containing concomitant *JAK* variants.[[126](#cit/section_3.126)]

Many of the remaining cases of *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL have been noted to have a series of translocations involving tyrosine-kinase encoding ABL-class fusion genes, including *ABL1*, *ABL2*, *CSF1R*, and *PDGFRB*.[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[121](#cit/section_3.121),[127](#cit/section_3.127)] Fusion proteins from these gene combinations have been noted in some cases to be transformative and have responded to tyrosine kinase inhibitors both *in vitro* and *in vivo*,[[121](#cit/section_3.121),[128](#cit/section_3.128)] suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for these patients. Preclinical drug sensitivity assays have suggested that sensitivity to different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may vary by the specific ABL-class gene involved in the fusion. In one study of *ex vivo* TKI sensitivity, samples from patients with *PDGFRB* fusions were sensitive to imatinib. However, these samples were less sensitive to dasatinib and bosutinib than samples from patients with *ABL1* fusions (including *BCR*::*ABL1*).[[128](#cit/section_3.128)] Clinical studies have not yet confirmed the differing responses to various TKIs by type of ABL-class fusion.

*BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL cases with non-*CRLF2* genomic alterations represent approximately 3% of NCI standard-risk and 8% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] In a retrospective study of 122 pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years) with ABL-class fusions (all treated without tyrosine kinase inhibitors), the 5-year EFS rate was 59%, and the OS rate was 76%.[[129](#cit/section_3.129)]

Approximately 9% of *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL cases result from rearrangements that lead to overexpression of a truncated erythropoietin receptor (EPOR).[[130](#cit/section_3.130)] The C-terminal region of the receptor that is lost is the region that is altered in primary familial congenital polycythemia and that controls stability of the EPOR. The portion of the EPOR remaining is sufficient for JAK-STAT activation and for driving leukemia development. Single nucleotide variants in kinase genes, aside from those in *JAK1* and *JAK2*, are uncommon in patients with *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)]

***CRLF2.*** Genomic alterations in *CRLF2*, a cytokine receptor gene located on the pseudoautosomal regions of the sex chromosomes, have been identified in 5% to 10% of cases of B-ALL. These alterations represent approximately 50% of cases of *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL.[[131](#cit/section_3.131)-[133](#cit/section_3.133)] The chromosomal abnormalities that commonly lead to *CRLF2* overexpression include translocations of the *IGH* locus (chromosome 14) to *CRLF2* and interstitial deletions in pseudoautosomal regions of the sex chromosomes, resulting in a *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* fusion.[[9](#cit/section_3.9),[125](#cit/section_3.125),[131](#cit/section_3.131),[132](#cit/section_3.132)] These two genomic alterations are associated with distinctive clinical and biological characteristics.

*BCR*::*ABL1*-like B-ALL with *CRLF2* genomic alterations is observed in approximately 2% of NCI standard-risk and 5% of NCI high-risk pediatric B-ALL cases.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

ALL with genomic alterations in *CRLF2* occurs at a higher incidence in children with Hispanic or Latino genetic ancestry [[125](#cit/section_3.125),[134](#cit/section_3.134),[135](#cit/section_3.135)] and American Indian genetic ancestry.[[87](#cit/section_3.87)] In a study of 205 children with high-risk B-ALL, 18 of 51 (35.3%) Hispanic or Latino patients had *CRLF2* rearrangements, compared with 11 of 154 (7.1%) cases of other declared ethnicity.[[125](#cit/section_3.125)] In a second study, the frequency of *IGH*::*CRLF2* fusions was increased in Hispanic or Latino children compared with non-Hispanic or non-Latino children with B-ALL (13.2% vs. 3.6%).[[134](#cit/section_3.134),[135](#cit/section_3.135)] In this study, the percentage of B-ALL with *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* fusions was approximately 6% and was not affected by ethnicity.

The *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* fusion is observed in 70% to 75% of pediatric patients with *CRLF2* genomic alterations, and it occurs in younger patients (median age, approximately 4 years vs. 14 years for patients with *IGH*::*CRLF2*).[[136](#cit/section_3.136),[137](#cit/section_3.137)] *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* occurs not infrequently with established chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., hyperdiploidy, iAMP21, dic(9;20)), while *IGH*::*CRLF2* is generally mutually exclusive with known cytogenetic subgroups. *CRLF2* genomic alterations are observed in approximately 60% of patients with Down syndrome and ALL, with *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* fusions being more common than *IGH*::*CRLF2* (approximately 80%–85% vs. 15%–20%).[[132](#cit/section_3.132),[136](#cit/section_3.136)]

*IGH*::*CRLF2* and *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* commonly occur as an early event in B-ALL development and show clonal prevalence.[[138](#cit/section_3.138)] However, in some cases they appear to be a late event and show subclonal prevalence.[[138](#cit/section_3.138)] Loss of the *CRLF2* genomic abnormality in some cases at relapse confirms the subclonal nature of the alteration in these cases.[[136](#cit/section_3.136),[139](#cit/section_3.139)]

*CRLF2* abnormalities are strongly associated with the presence of *IKZF1* deletions. Deletions of *IKZF1* are more common in cases with *IGH*::*CRLF2* fusions than in cases with *P2RY8*::*CRLF2* fusions.[[137](#cit/section_3.137)] Hispanic and Latino children have a higher frequency of *CRLF2* rearrangements with *IKZF1* deletions than non-Hispanic children.[[135](#cit/section_3.135)]

Other recurring genomic alterations found in association with *CRLF2* alterations include deletions in genes associated with B-cell differentiation (e.g., *PAX5*, *BTG1*, *EBF1*, etc.) and cell cycle control (*CDKN2A*), as well as genomic alterations activating JAK-STAT pathway signaling (e.g., *IL7R* and *JAK* variants).[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[125](#cit/section_3.125),[126](#cit/section_3.126),[132](#cit/section_3.132),[140](#cit/section_3.140)]

Although the results of several retrospective studies suggest that *CRLF2* abnormalities may have adverse prognostic significance in univariate analyses, most do not find this abnormality to be an independent predictor of outcome.[[125](#cit/section_3.125),[131](#cit/section_3.131),[132](#cit/section_3.132),[141](#cit/section_3.141),[142](#cit/section_3.142)] For example, in a large European study, increased expression of *CRLF2* was not associated with unfavorable outcome in multivariate analysis, while *IKZF1* deletion and *BCR*::*ABL1*-like expression signatures were associated with unfavorable outcome.[[122](#cit/section_3.122)] Controversy exists about whether the prognostic significance of *CRLF2* abnormalities should be analyzed on the basis of *CRLF2* overexpression or on the presence of *CRLF2* genomic alterations.[[141](#cit/section_3.141),[142](#cit/section_3.142)]
- ***IKZF1* deletions.**

*IKZF1* deletions, including deletions of the entire gene and deletions of specific exons, are present in approximately 15% of B-ALL cases. Less commonly, *IKZF1* can be inactivated by deleterious single nucleotide variants.[[119](#cit/section_3.119)]

Cases with *IKZF1* deletions tend to occur in older children, have a higher WBC count at diagnosis, and are therefore more common in NCI high-risk patients than in NCI standard-risk patients.[[3](#cit/section_3.3),[119](#cit/section_3.119),[140](#cit/section_3.140),[143](#cit/section_3.143),[144](#cit/section_3.144)] A high proportion of *BCR*::*ABL1*-positive cases have a deletion of *IKZF1*,[[4](#cit/section_3.4),[140](#cit/section_3.140)] and ALL arising in children with Down syndrome appears to have elevated rates of *IKZF1* deletions.[[145](#cit/section_3.145)] *IKZF1* deletions are also common in cases with *CRLF2* genomic alterations and in *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL cases.[[89](#cit/section_3.89),[118](#cit/section_3.118),[140](#cit/section_3.140)] *IKZF1* deletions also occur more commonly in Hispanic children. In one study from a single cancer center, *IKZF1* deletions were observed in 29% of Hispanic children, compared with 11% of non-Hispanic children (*P* = .001).[[135](#cit/section_3.135)]

Multiple reports have documented the adverse prognostic significance of an *IKZF1* deletion, and most studies have reported that this deletion is an independent predictor of poor outcome in multivariate analyses.[[89](#cit/section_3.89),[118](#cit/section_3.118),[119](#cit/section_3.119),[122](#cit/section_3.122),[140](#cit/section_3.140),[146](#cit/section_3.146)-[153](#cit/section_3.153)]; [[154](#cit/section_3.154)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] However, the prognostic significance of *IKZF1* may not apply equally across ALL biological subtypes, as illustrated by the apparent lack of prognostic significance in patients with *ERG* deletions.[[89](#cit/section_3.89)-[91](#cit/section_3.91)] Similarly, the prognostic significance of the *IKZF1* deletion also appeared to be minimized in a cohort of COG patients with *DUX4*-rearranged ALL and with *ERG* transcriptional dysregulation that frequently occurred by *ERG* deletion.[[7](#cit/section_3.7)] The Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica–Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster group reported that *IKZF1* deletions were significant adverse prognostic factors only in B-ALL patients with high end-induction MRD and in whom co-occurrence of deletions of *CDKN2A*, *CDKN2B*, *PAX5*, or *PAR1* (in the absence of *ERG* deletion) were identified.[[155](#cit/section_3.155)] This combination of *IKZF1* deletion with accompanying deletion of select other genes is termed IKZF1PLUS.[[155](#cit/section_3.155)] In a single-center study, the IKZF1PLUS profile was more commonly observed in Hispanic children than in non-Hispanic children (20% vs. 5%, *P* = .001).[[135](#cit/section_3.135)]

The poor prognosis associated with *IKZF1* alterations appears to be enhanced by the concomitant finding of deletion of 22q11.22. In a study of 1,310 patients with B-ALL, approximately one-half of the patients with *IKZF1* alterations also had deletion of 22q11.22. The 5-year EFS rate was 43.3% for those with both abnormalities, compared with 68.5% for patients with *IKZF1* alterations and wild-type 22q11.22 (*P* < .001).[[156](#cit/section_3.156)]

There are few published results of changing therapy on the basis of *IKZF1* gene status. The Malaysia-Singapore group published results of two consecutive trials. In the first trial (MS2003), *IKZF1* status was not considered in risk stratification, while in the subsequent trial (MS2010), *IKZF1*-deleted patients were excluded from the standard-risk group. Thus, more *IKZF1*-deleted patients in the MS2010 trial received intensified therapy. Patients with *IKZF1*-deleted ALL had improved outcomes in MS2010 compared with patients in MS2003, but interpretation of this observation is limited by other changes in risk stratification and therapeutic differences between the two trials.[[157](#cit/section_3.157)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

In the Dutch ALL11 study, patients with *IKZF1* deletions had maintenance therapy extended by 1 year, with the goal of improving outcomes.[[158](#cit/section_3.158)] The landmark analysis demonstrated an almost threefold reduction in relapse rate and an improvement in the 2-year EFS rate (from 74.4% to 91.2%), compared with historical controls.
- ***MYC*-rearranged ALL (8q24).**

*MYC* gene rearrangements are a rare but recurrent finding in pediatric patients with B-ALL. Patients with rearrangements of the *MYC* gene and the *IGH2*, *IGK*, and *IGL* genes at 14q32, 2p12, and 22q11.2, respectively, have been reported.[[159](#cit/section_3.159)-[161](#cit/section_3.161)] The lymphoblasts typically exhibit a precursor B-cell immunophenotype, with a French-American-British (FAB) L2 or L3 morphology, with no expression of surface immunoglobulin and kappa or lambda light chains. Concurrent *MYC* gene rearrangements have been observed along with additional cytogenetic rearrangements such as *IGH*::*BCL2* or *KMT2A*.[[161](#cit/section_3.161)] Patients reported in the literature have been variably treated with ALL therapy or with mature B leukemia/lymphoma treatment protocols, and the optimal treatment for this patient group remains uncertain.[[161](#cit/section_3.161)]

### Genomics of ALL in children with Down syndrome

The largest study that examined the genomic landscape of ALL arising in children with Down syndrome included 295 patients enrolled in COG clinical trials.[[11](#cit/section_3.11)]

- Almost all cases of ALL in children with Down syndrome are B-ALL. T-ALL is uncommon.
- The common recurring genomic alterations found in non-Down syndrome ALL (e.g., high hyperdiploidy and *ETV6*::*RUNX1*) occur much less often in children with Down syndrome and ALL. Other alterations occur more often in children with Down syndrome and ALL.
- Fifty percent to 60% of children with Down syndrome and ALL have *CRLF2* rearrangements involving either *IGH* or *P2RY8*, with most cases (85%) involving *P2RY8*.

- Approximately one-half of *CRLF2*-rearranged cases have *JAK2* variants, which are not seen in children with Down syndrome and ALL who do not have *CRLF2* rearrangements.
- *IKZF1* alterations occur in approximately 30% of cases with *CRLF2* rearrangements but in only approximately 10% of cases without *CRLF2* rearrangements.
- Twenty-five percent of *CRLF2*-rearranged cases in patients with Down syndrome are classified by gene expression as *BCR*::*ABL1*-like, compared with 54% of *CRLF2*-rearranged non-Down syndrome ALL cases.
- Overall, patients with *CRLF2*-rearranged ALL and Down syndrome have an intermediate prognosis. However, patients with a *BCR*::*ABL1*-like gene expression signature have worse outcomes than those without a *BCR*::*ABL1*-like gene expression signature and *CRLF2* rearrangements (EFS rates, 39.5% ± 8.1% vs. 82% ± 4.4%; OS rates, 70.3% ± 8.7% vs. 86.9% ± 4.8%).
- The *IGH*::*IGF2BP1* gene fusion occurs in approximately 3% of patients with Down syndrome. This gene fusion is rare in patients with ALL who do not have Down syndrome. In one retrospective analysis, this fusion was associated with a relatively favorable outcome (EFS rate, 87.5% ± 11.7%).
- C/EBP altered (C/EBPalt) B-ALL, which is characterized by aberrant activation of C/EBP family genes, is also markedly enriched in children with Down syndrome (10.5% of Down syndrome ALL vs. 0.1% of non-Down syndrome B-ALL).

- Rearrangements of *CEBPD* are the most common C/EBPalt lesion, occurring in 7.5% of Down syndrome ALL cases. The fusion partner for more than 80% of *CEBPD* rearrangements is *IGH*. Less common fusion partners include *MME*, *TPM4*, 9p13.2, and 6q25.3.
- Another 4% to 5% of Down syndrome ALL is characterized by alterations in other C/EBP family members, such as *CEBPA* and *CEBPE*.
- C/EBPalt cases commonly harbor concomitant variants of *FLT3*, *KDM6A*, and *SETD2*.
- C/EBPalt was associated with high rates of MRD-negative remission at the end of induction therapy (87.1%) and an intermediate outcome (10-year EFS rate, 73.9% ± 9.9%; 10-year OS rate, 76.7% ± 12.8%).

### T-ALL cytogenetics/genomics

T-ALL is characterized by genomic alterations leading to activation of transcriptional programs related to T-cell development and by a high frequency of cases (approximately 60%) with variants in *NOTCH1* and/or *FBXW7* that result in activation of the NOTCH1 pathway.[[162](#cit/section_3.162)] Cytogenetic abnormalities common in B-ALL (e.g., hyperdiploidy, 51–65 chromosomes) are
rare in T-ALL.[[163](#cit/section_3.163),[164](#cit/section_3.164)]

In Figure 5 below, pediatric T-ALL cases are divided into 10 molecular subtypes based on their RNA expression and gene variant status. These cases were derived from patients enrolled in SJCRH and COG clinical trials.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Each subtype is associated with dysregulation of specific genes involved in T-cell development. Within a subtype, multiple mechanisms may drive expression of the dysregulated gene. For example, for the largest subtype, *TAL1*, overexpression of TAL1 can result from the *STIL*::*TAL1* fusion and a noncoding insertion variant upstream of the TAL1 locus that creates a *MYB*-binding site.[[162](#cit/section_3.162),[165](#cit/section_3.165)] As another example, within the HOXA group, overexpression of *HOXA9* can result from multiple gene fusions, including *KMT2A* rearrangements, *MLLT10* rearrangements, and *SET*::*NUP214* fusions.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[162](#cit/section_3.162),[166](#cit/section_3.166)] In contrast to the molecular subtypes of B-ALL, the molecular subtypes of T-ALL are not used to define treatment interventions based on their prognostic significance or therapeutic implications.

- **Notch pathway signaling.**

Notch pathway signaling is commonly activated by *NOTCH1* and *FBXW7* gene variants in T-ALL, and these are the most commonly altered genes in pediatric T-ALL.[[162](#cit/section_3.162),[167](#cit/section_3.167)] *NOTCH1*-activating gene variants occur in approximately 50% to 60% of T-ALL cases, and *FBXW7*-inactivating gene variants occur in approximately 15% of cases. Approximately 60% of T-ALL cases have Notch pathway activation by variants in at least one of these genes.[[168](#cit/section_3.168),[169](#cit/section_3.169)]

The prognostic significance of *NOTCH1* and *FBXW7* variants may be modulated by genomic alterations in RAS and PTEN. The French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Study Group (FRALLE) and the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia reported that patients having altered *NOTCH1* or *FBXW7* and wild-type *PTEN* and *RAS* constituted a favorable-risk group (i.e., low-risk group), while patients with *PTEN* or *RAS* variants, regardless of *NOTCH1* and *FBXW7* status, have a significantly higher risk of treatment failure (i.e., high-risk group).[[170](#cit/section_3.170),[171](#cit/section_3.171)] In the FRALLE study, the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 88% for the genetic low-risk group of patients and 60% for the genetic high-risk group of patients.[[170](#cit/section_3.170)] However, using the same criteria to define the genetic risk group, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute consortium was unable to replicate these results. They reported a 5-year EFS rate of 86% for genetic low-risk patients and 79% for the genetic high-risk patients, a difference that was not statistically significant (*P* = .26).[[169](#cit/section_3.169)]
- **Chromosomal translocations.**

Multiple chromosomal translocations have been identified in T-ALL that lead to deregulated expression of the target genes. These chromosome rearrangements fuse genes encoding transcription factors (e.g., *TAL1*, *TAL2*, *LMO1*, *LMO2*, *LYL1*, *TLX1*, *TLX3*, *NKX2-I*, *HOXA*, and *MYB*) to one of the T-cell receptor loci (or to other genes) and result in deregulated expression of these transcription factors in leukemia cells.[[162](#cit/section_3.162),[163](#cit/section_3.163),[172](#cit/section_3.172)-[176](#cit/section_3.176)] These translocations are often not apparent by examining a standard karyotype, but can be identified using more sensitive screening techniques, including FISH or PCR.[[163](#cit/section_3.163)] Variants in a noncoding region near the *TAL1* gene that produce a super-enhancer upstream of *TAL1* represent nontranslocation genomic alterations that can also activate *TAL1* transcription to induce T-ALL.[[165](#cit/section_3.165)]

Translocations resulting in chimeric fusion proteins are also observed in T-ALL.[[170](#cit/section_3.170)]

- A *NUP214*::*ABL1* fusion has been noted in 4% to 6% of T-ALL cases and is observed in both adults and children, with a male predominance.[[177](#cit/section_3.177)-[179](#cit/section_3.179)] The fusion is cytogenetically cryptic and is seen in FISH on amplified episomes or, more rarely, as a small homogeneous staining region.[[179](#cit/section_3.179)] T-ALL may also uncommonly show ABL1 fusion proteins with other gene partners (e.g., *ETV6*, *BCR*, and *EML1*).[[179](#cit/section_3.179)] ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib or dasatinib, may demonstrate therapeutic benefits in this T-ALL subtype,[[177](#cit/section_3.177),[178](#cit/section_3.178),[180](#cit/section_3.180)] although clinical experience with this strategy is very limited.[[181](#cit/section_3.181)-[183](#cit/section_3.183)]
- Gene fusions involving *SPI1* (encoding the transcription factor PU.1) were reported in 4% of Japanese children with T-ALL.[[184](#cit/section_3.184)] Fusion partners included *STMN1* and *TCF7*. T-ALL cases with *SPI1* fusions had a particularly poor prognosis; six of seven affected individuals died within 3 years of diagnosis of early relapse.
- BCL11B is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a dual role as a transcription activator and repressor. It is known to play a critical role in T-cell differentiation. In T-ALL, the *BCL11B* gene is involved in a t(5;14)(q35;q32) translocation where a distal *BCL11B* enhancer drives aberrant expression of *TLX3* (or *NKX2-5*).[[185](#cit/section_3.185)] In the process of donating its enhancer, one allele of *BCL11B* is inactivated. However, the resulting haploinsufficient state itself may also play a role in tumor pathogenesis. The role of *BCL11B* as a tumor suppressor gene is supported by the finding that about 16% of patients have T-ALL that harbors deletions or missense variants.[[162](#cit/section_3.162),[186](#cit/section_3.186)] As described in the sections for early T-cell precursor (ETP) and T/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia (T/M MPAL), *BCL11B* may also be leukemogenic through overexpression.
- Other recurring gene fusions in T-ALL patients include those involving *MLLT10*, *KMT2A*, *NUP214*, and *NUP98*.[[162](#cit/section_3.162),[166](#cit/section_3.166)]
- **Ploidy.**

- Recurrent abnormalities in chromosome number are much less common in T-ALL than in B-ALL. One study included 2,250 pediatric patients with T-ALL who were treated in Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica/Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster protocols. The study found that near tetraploidy (DNA index, 1.79–2.28 or 81–103 chromosomes), observed in 1.4% of patients, was associated with favorable disease features and outcomes.[[187](#cit/section_3.187)]

#### Early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL cytogenetics/genomics

Detailed molecular characterization of ETP ALL showed this entity to be highly heterogeneous at the molecular level, with no single gene affected by variant or copy number alteration in more than one-third of cases.[[188](#cit/section_3.188)] Compared with other T-ALL cases, the ETP group had a lower rate of *NOTCH1* variants and significantly higher frequencies of alterations in genes regulating cytokine receptors and RAS signaling, hematopoietic development, and histone modification. The transcriptional profile of ETP ALL shows similarities to that of normal hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid leukemia stem cells.[[188](#cit/section_3.188)]

Studies have found that the absence of biallelic deletion of the TCR-gamma locus (ABD), as detected by comparative genomic hybridization and/or quantitative DNA-PCR, was associated with early treatment failure in patients with T-ALL.[[189](#cit/section_3.189),[190](#cit/section_3.190)] ABD is characteristic of early thymic precursor cells, and many of the T-ALL patients with ABD have an immunophenotype consistent with the diagnosis of ETP phenotype.

Allele-specific, generally high expression of *BCL11B* plays an oncogenic role in a subset of cases identified as ETP ALL (7 of 58 in one study) as well as in up to 30% to 40% of lineage ambiguous leukemia T/M mixed phenotype acute leukemia (T/M MPAL).[[191](#cit/section_3.191),[192](#cit/section_3.192)] The dysregulated expression of *BCL11B* can occur by multiple mechanisms.

- One such alteration is t(2;14)(q22;q32), which produces an in-frame *ZEB2*::*BCL11B* fusion gene.
- Other structural variants leading to allele-specific deregulated BCL11B expression include structural variants that juxtapose regulatory sequences of active genes (e.g., *ARID1B* [chromosome 6], *BENC* [chromosome 7], and *CDK6* [chromosome 7]) upstream or downstream of the *BCL11B* locus leading to aberrant expression in a process called enhancer hijacking.
- Finally, in about 20% of cases with deregulated BCL11B expression, a translocation cannot be identified. In many such cases, amplification of a downstream enhancer, BCL11B enhancer tandem amplification (BETA), leads to BCL11B promoter driven transcription.
- There is a high prevalence of FLT3 alterations and JAK/STAT activation in acute leukemias driven by genomic alterations leading to BCL11B expression.[[191](#cit/section_3.191)]

### Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) cytogenetics/genomics

For acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, the WHO classification system is summarized in Table 3.[[193](#cit/section_3.193),[194](#cit/section_3.194)] The criteria for lineage assignment for a diagnosis of MPAL are provided in Table 4.[[106](#cit/section_3.106)]

The classification system for MPAL includes two entities that are defined by their primary molecular alteration: MPAL with *BCR*::*ABL1* translocation and MPAL with *KMT2A* rearrangement. The genomic alterations associated with the MPAL, B/myeloid, NOS (B/M MPAL) and MPAL, T/myeloid, NOS (T/M MPAL) entities are distinctive, as described below:

- **B/M MPAL.**

- Among 115 MPAL cases for which genomic characterization was performed, 35 (30%) were B/M MPAL. There were an additional 16 MPAL cases (14%) with *KMT2A* rearrangements, 15 of whom showed a B/myeloid immunophenotype.
- Approximately one-half of B/M MPAL cases had rearrangements of *ZNF384* with recurrent fusion partners, including *TCF3* and *EP300*. These cases had gene expression profiles indistinguishable from B-ALL cases with *ZNF384* rearrangements.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)]
- Approximately two-thirds of B/M MPAL cases had RAS pathway alterations, with *NRAS* and *PTPN11* being the most commonly altered genes.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)]
- Genes encoding epigenetic regulators (e.g., *MLLT3*, *KDM6A*, *EP300*, and *CREBBP*) are altered in approximately two-thirds of B/M MPAL cases.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)]
- **T/M MPAL.**

- Among 115 MPAL cases for which genomic characterization was performed, 49 (43%) were T/M MPAL.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)] The genomic features of the T/M MPAL cases shared commonalities with those of ETP ALL, suggesting that T/M MPAL and ETP ALL are similar entities along the spectrum of immature leukemias.
- Compared with T-ALL, T/M MPAL showed a lower rate of alterations in the core T-ALL transcription factors (*TAL1*, *TAL2*, *TLX1*, *TLX3*, *LMO1*, *LMO2*, *NKX2-1*, *HOXA10*, and *LYL1*) (63% vs. 16%, respectively).[[102](#cit/section_3.102)] A similar lower rate was also observed for ETP ALL.
- *CDKN2A*, *CDKN2B*, and *NOTCH1* variants, which are present in approximately two-thirds of T-ALL cases, were much less common in T/M MPAL cases. By contrast, *WT1* variants occurred in approximately 40% of T/M MPAL, but in less than 10% of T-ALL cases.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)]
- One-third of T/M MPAL cases have genomic alterations associated with *BCL11B* that lead to allele-specific, generally high expression of BCL11B.[[191](#cit/section_3.191),[192](#cit/section_3.192)]

- One such alteration is t(2;14)(q22;q32), which produces an in-frame *ZEB2*::*BCL11B* fusion gene that leads to deregulated expression of BCL11B.
- Other alterations leading to allele-specific deregulated BCL11B expression include structural variants that juxtapose regulatory sequences of active genes (e.g., *ARID1B* [chromosome 6], *BENC* [chromosome 7], and *CDK6* [chromosome 7]) upstream or downstream of the *BCL11B* locus in a process called enhancer hijacking.
- Finally, a translocation cannot be identified in about 20% of cases with deregulated BCL11B overexpression. In such cases, amplification of a downstream enhancer, BCL11B enhancer tandem amplification (BETA), leads to BCL11B promoter driven transcription.
- There is a high prevalence of *FLT3* alterations and JAK/STAT activation in acute leukemias driven by genomic alterations leading to BCL11B overexpression.
- RAS and JAK-STAT pathway variants were common in the T/M MPAL and ETP ALL cases, while the PI3K signaling pathway is more commonly altered in T-ALL.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)] For T/M MPAL, the most commonly altered signaling pathway gene was *FLT3* (43% of cases). *FLT3* variants tended to be mutually exclusive with RAS pathway variants.
- Genes encoding epigenetic regulators (e.g., *EZH2* and *PHF6*) were altered in approximately two-thirds of T/M MPAL cases.[[102](#cit/section_3.102)]

### Gene polymorphisms in drug metabolic pathways

Several polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents have been reported to have prognostic significance in childhood ALL.[[195](#cit/section_3.195)-[197](#cit/section_3.197)]

- ***TPMT*.**

Patients with variant phenotypes of *TPMT* (a gene involved in the metabolism of thiopurines such as mercaptopurine) appear to have more favorable outcomes,[[198](#cit/section_3.198)] although such patients may also be at higher risk of developing significant treatment-related toxicities, including myelosuppression, infection, and second malignancies.[[199](#cit/section_3.199),[200](#cit/section_3.200)] Patients with homozygosity for *TPMT* variants associated with low enzymatic activity tolerate only very low doses of mercaptopurine (approximately 10% of the standard dose) and are treated with reduced doses of mercaptopurine to avoid excessive toxicity. Patients who are heterozygous for this variant enzyme gene generally tolerate mercaptopurine without serious toxicity, but they do require more frequent dose reductions for hematologic toxicity than do patients who are homozygous for the normal allele.[[201](#cit/section_3.201),[202](#cit/section_3.202)]
- ***NUDT15*.**

Germline pathogenic variants in *NUDT15* that reduce or abolish activity of this enzyme also lead to diminished tolerance to thiopurines.[[201](#cit/section_3.201),[203](#cit/section_3.203)] The *NUDT15* variants are most common in East Asian and Hispanic patients, and they are rare in European and African patients. Patients homozygous for the risk variants tolerate only very low doses of mercaptopurine, while patients heterozygous for the risk alleles tolerate lower doses than do patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (approximately 25% dose reduction on average), but there is broad overlap in tolerated doses between the two groups.[[201](#cit/section_3.201),[204](#cit/section_3.204)]
- **CEP72.**

Gene polymorphisms may also affect the expression of proteins that play central roles in the cellular effects of anticancer drugs. As an example, patients who are homozygous for a polymorphism in the promoter region of CEP72 (a centrosomal protein involved in microtubule formation) are at increased risk of vincristine neurotoxicity.[[205](#cit/section_3.205)]
- **Single nucleotide polymorphisms.**

Genome-wide polymorphism analysis has identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with high end-induction MRD and risk of relapse. Polymorphisms
of interleukin-15, as well as genes associated with the metabolism of etoposide and methotrexate, were significantly associated with treatment response in two large cohorts of ALL patients treated on SJCRH and COG protocols.[[206](#cit/section_3.206)] Polymorphic variants involving the reduced folate carrier and methotrexate metabolism have been linked to toxicity and outcome.[[207](#cit/section_3.207),[208](#cit/section_3.208)] While these associations suggest that individual variations in drug metabolism can affect outcome, few studies have
attempted to adjust for these variations. It is unknown whether individualized dose modification on the basis of these findings will improve outcomes.

## Risk-Based Treatment Assignment

### Introduction to Risk-Based Treatment

Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are usually treated according to risk groups defined by both clinical and laboratory features. The intensity of treatment required for cure varies substantially among subsets of children with ALL. Risk-based treatment assignment is used in children with ALL so that patients with favorable clinical and biological features who are likely to have a very good outcome with modest therapy can be spared more intensive and toxic treatment, while a more aggressive, potentially more toxic therapeutic approach is reserved for patients with a lower probability of long-term survival.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

Certain ALL study groups, such as the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), use a more- or less-intensive induction regimen based on a subset of pretreatment factors, while other groups give a similar induction regimen to all patients.

Factors used by the COG to determine the intensity of induction include the following:

- Immunophenotype.
- The presence or absence of extramedullary disease.
- Steroid pretreatment.
- The presence or absence of Down syndrome.
- The National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk group classification.

The NCI risk group classification for B-ALL stratifies risk according to age and white blood cell (WBC) count, as follows:[[3](#cit/section_4.3)]

- Standard risk: WBC count less than 50,000/μL **and** age 1 to younger than 10 years.
- High risk: WBC count 50,000/μL or greater **and/or** age 10 years or older.

All study groups modify the intensity of postinduction therapy on the basis of a variety of prognostic factors, including NCI risk group, immunophenotype, early response determinations, and cytogenetics and genomic alterations.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] Detection of the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion (i.e., *BCR*::*ABL1*-positive ALL) leads to immediate changes in induction therapy, including the addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, such as imatinib or dasatinib.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

Risk-based treatment assignment requires the availability of prognostic factors that reliably predict outcome. For children with ALL, a number of factors have demonstrated prognostic value, some of which are described below.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)] Factors affecting prognosis are grouped into the following three categories:

- [Patient and clinical disease characteristics.](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_554)
- [Leukemic characteristics.](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_494)
- [Response to initial treatment.](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_526)

As in any discussion of prognostic factors, the relative order of significance and the interrelationship of the variables are often treatment dependent and require multivariate analysis to determine which factors operate independently as prognostic variables. Because prognostic factors are treatment dependent, improvements in therapy may diminish or abrogate the significance of any of these prognostic factors.

A subset of the prognostic and clinical factors discussed below is used for the initial stratification of children with ALL for treatment assignment. For brief descriptions of the prognostic groupings currently applied in ongoing clinical trials in the United States, see the [Prognostic (risk) groups under clinical evaluation](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_543) section.

For information about important prognostic factors at relapse, see the [Prognostic Factors After First Relapse of Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1206) section.

### Prognostic Factors Affecting Risk-Based Treatment

#### Patient and clinical disease characteristics

Patient and clinical disease characteristics affecting prognosis include the following:

1. [Age at diagnosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1304).
2. [WBC count at diagnosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1306).
3. [Central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1307).
4. [Testicular involvement at diagnosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1308).
5. [Down syndrome (trisomy 21)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1309).
6. [Sex](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1310).
7. [Race and ethnicity](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1311).
8. [Weight at diagnosis and during treatment](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1738).

##### Age at diagnosis

Age at diagnosis has strong prognostic significance in patients with B-ALL,
reflecting the different underlying biology of ALL in different age groups.[[7](#cit/section_4.7)] Age at diagnosis is not prognostically relevant in T-ALL.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)]

1. **Infants (younger than 1 year).**

Infants with ALL have a particularly high risk of treatment failure. Treatment failure is most common in the following groups:

- Infants younger than 6 months (with an even poorer prognosis for those aged ≤90 days).[[9](#cit/section_4.9)-[13](#cit/section_4.13)]
- Infants with extremely high presenting leukocyte counts (>200,000–300,000 × 109/L).[[10](#cit/section_4.10)]
- Infants with a poor response to a prednisone prophase.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)]
- Infants with a *KMT2A* gene rearrangement.[[9](#cit/section_4.9)-[12](#cit/section_4.12)]

Up to 80% of infants with ALL have a translocation of 11q23 with numerous chromosome partners generating a *KMT2A* gene rearrangement.[[10](#cit/section_4.10),[12](#cit/section_4.12),[14](#cit/section_4.14),[15](#cit/section_4.15)] The most common rearrangement is *KMT2A*::*AFF1* (t(4;11)(q21;q23)), but *KMT2A* rearrangements with many other translocation partners are observed. Infants with leukemia and *KMT2A* rearrangements typically have very high WBC counts and an increased incidence of CNS involvement. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates are poor. The 5-year EFS and OS rates are 35% to 40% for infants with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL.[[10](#cit/section_4.10)-[12](#cit/section_4.12)]

The frequency of *KMT2A* gene rearrangements is extremely high in infants younger than 6 months. From 6 months to 1 year, the incidence of *KMT2A* rearrangements decreases but remains significantly higher than that observed in older children.[[10](#cit/section_4.10),[16](#cit/section_4.16)] Blasts from infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements are often CD10 negative and express high levels of *FLT3*.[[10](#cit/section_4.10),[11](#cit/section_4.11),[15](#cit/section_4.15),[17](#cit/section_4.17)] Conversely, infants whose leukemic cells show a germline *KMT2A* gene configuration frequently present with CD10-positive precursor-B immunophenotype. These infants have a significantly better outcome than do infants with ALL characterized by *KMT2A* rearrangements.[[10](#cit/section_4.10),[11](#cit/section_4.11),[15](#cit/section_4.15),[18](#cit/section_4.18)]

Black infants with ALL are significantly less likely to have *KMT2A* rearrangements than White infants.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)]

A comparison of the landscape of somatic variants in infants and older children with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL revealed significant differences between the two groups. This result suggests distinctive age-related biological behaviors for *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL that may relate to the significantly poorer outcome for infants.[[19](#cit/section_4.19),[20](#cit/section_4.20)]

For more information about infants with
ALL, see the [Infants With ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1152) section.
2. **Young children (aged 1 to <10 years).**

Young children (aged 1 to <10 years) with B-ALL have a better disease-free survival (DFS) rate than older children, adolescents, and infants.[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[7](#cit/section_4.7),[21](#cit/section_4.21)-[23](#cit/section_4.23)] The improved prognosis in young children is at least partly explained by the more frequent occurrence of favorable cytogenetic features in the leukemic blasts, including hyperdiploidy with 51 to 65 chromosomes and/or favorable chromosome trisomies, or the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion (t(12;21)(p13;q22), previously known as the *TEL*::*AML1* translocation).[[7](#cit/section_4.7),[24](#cit/section_4.24),[25](#cit/section_4.25)]
3. **Adolescents and young adults (aged ≥10 years).**

In general, the outcome of patients with B-ALL aged 10 years and older is inferior to that of patients aged 1 to younger than 10 years.[[26](#cit/section_4.26)] Patients aged 10 to 15 years fare better than those who are aged 16 to 21 years at diagnosis who were treated with pediatric regimens.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)] However, the outcome for older adolescents has improved significantly over time.[[27](#cit/section_4.27)-[29](#cit/section_4.29)] Five-year survival
rates for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years increased from 36% (1975–1984) to 78% (2011–2017).[[30](#cit/section_4.30)-[33](#cit/section_4.33)]

Multiple retrospective studies have established that adolescents aged 16 to 21 years have a better outcome when treated on pediatric versus adult protocols.[[34](#cit/section_4.34)-[36](#cit/section_4.36)] For more information about adolescents with
ALL, see the [Postinduction Treatment for Specific ALL Subgroups](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1141) section.

##### WBC count at diagnosis

A
WBC count of 50,000/µL is generally used as an operational cut point between
better and poorer prognosis,[[3](#cit/section_4.3)] although the relationship between WBC count and
prognosis is a continuous function rather than a step function. Patients with B-ALL and high WBC counts at diagnosis have an increased risk of treatment failure compared with patients with low initial WBC counts.[[37](#cit/section_4.37)]

The median WBC count at diagnosis is much higher for T-ALL (>50,000/µL) than for B-ALL (<10,000/µL), and there is no consistent effect of WBC count at diagnosis on prognosis for T-ALL.[[37](#cit/section_4.37)-[46](#cit/section_4.46)]

##### CNS involvement at diagnosis

The presence or absence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis has prognostic significance in both patients with B-ALL and T-ALL. Patients who have a nontraumatic diagnostic lumbar puncture may be placed into one of three categories according to the number of WBC/µL and the presence or absence of blasts on cytospin as follows:

- **CNS1:**  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that is cytospin negative for blasts regardless of WBC count.
- **CNS2:**  CSF with fewer than 5 WBC/µL and cytospin positive for blasts.
- **CNS3 (CNS disease):**  CSF with 5 or more WBC/µL and cytospin positive for blasts or clinical signs of CNS leukemia (i.e., facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement, or hypothalamic syndrome).

Children with B-ALL or T-ALL who present with CNS3 disease at diagnosis are at a higher risk of treatment failure (both within the CNS and systemically) than patients who are classified as CNS1 or CNS2.[[47](#cit/section_4.47)-[49](#cit/section_4.49)] The prognostic implication of CNS2 status at diagnosis may differ between patients with B-ALL and T-ALL. Some studies have reported increased risk of CNS relapse and/or inferior EFS in patients with B-ALL and CNS2 status at diagnosis, compared with patients with CNS1 status,[[50](#cit/section_4.50),[51](#cit/section_4.51)] while other studies have not.[[47](#cit/section_4.47),[52](#cit/section_4.52)-[54](#cit/section_4.54)] In an analysis of 2,164 patients with T-ALL treated in two consecutive COG trials, there was no difference in EFS, DFS, or cumulative incidence of relapse between patients with CNS1 and CNS2 status.[[49](#cit/section_4.49)]

A traumatic lumbar puncture (≥10 erythrocytes/µL) that includes blasts at diagnosis has also been associated with increased risk of CNS relapse and overall poorer outcome in some studies,[[47](#cit/section_4.47),[53](#cit/section_4.53),[55](#cit/section_4.55)] but not others.[[51](#cit/section_4.51),[52](#cit/section_4.52),[56](#cit/section_4.56)] Patients with CNS2, CNS3, or traumatic lumbar puncture have a higher frequency of unfavorable prognostic characteristics than those with CNS1, including significantly higher WBC counts at diagnosis, older age at diagnosis, an increased frequency of the T-ALL phenotype, and *KMT2A* gene rearrangements.[[47](#cit/section_4.47),[52](#cit/section_4.52),[53](#cit/section_4.53)]

Most clinical trial groups have approached the treatment of CNS2 and traumatic lumbar puncture patients by using more intensive therapy, primarily additional doses of intrathecal therapy during induction.[[47](#cit/section_4.47),[57](#cit/section_4.57),[58](#cit/section_4.58)]; [[52](#cit/section_4.52)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[59](#cit/section_4.59)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

To determine whether a patient with a traumatic lumbar puncture (with blasts) should be treated as CNS3, the COG uses an algorithm relating the WBC and red blood cell counts in the spinal fluid and the peripheral blood.[[60](#cit/section_4.60)]

##### Testicular involvement at diagnosis

Overt testicular involvement at the time of diagnosis occurs in approximately 2% of males,[[61](#cit/section_4.61),[62](#cit/section_4.62)] with a higher frequency in patients with T-ALL than in patients with B-ALL.[[62](#cit/section_4.62)]

In early ALL trials, testicular involvement at diagnosis was an adverse prognostic factor. With more aggressive initial therapy, however, it does not appear to have prognostic significance.[[61](#cit/section_4.61),[62](#cit/section_4.62)] For example, a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial (EORTC-58881) reported no adverse prognostic significance for overt testicular involvement at diagnosis.[[62](#cit/section_4.62)]

The role of radiation therapy for testicular involvement is unclear. A study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) suggests that a good outcome can be achieved with aggressive conventional chemotherapy without radiation.[[61](#cit/section_4.61)] The COG has also adopted this strategy for boys with testicular involvement that resolves completely by the end of induction therapy. The COG considers patients with testicular involvement to be high risk regardless of other presenting features, but most other large clinical trial groups in the United States and Europe do not consider testicular disease to be a high-risk feature.

##### Down syndrome (trisomy 21)

Outcomes in children with Down syndrome and ALL have often been somewhat inferior to outcomes in children without Down syndrome.[[63](#cit/section_4.63)-[67](#cit/section_4.67)] However, in some studies, patients with Down syndrome appeared to fare as well as those without Down syndrome.[[68](#cit/section_4.68),[69](#cit/section_4.69)] The lower EFS and OS of children with Down syndrome appear to be related to
increased frequency of treatment-related mortality, as well as higher rates of induction failure and relapse.[[63](#cit/section_4.63)-[66](#cit/section_4.66),[70](#cit/section_4.70),[71](#cit/section_4.71)] The inferior anti-leukemic outcome may be due, in part, to the decreased prevalence of favorable biological features such as *ETV6*::*RUNX1* or hyperdiploidy (51–65 chromosomes) with trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10 in Down syndrome ALL patients.[[70](#cit/section_4.70)-[72](#cit/section_4.72)]

- In a large retrospective study that included 653 patients with Down syndrome and ALL, patients with Down syndrome had a lower complete remission (CR) rate (97% vs. 99%, *P* < .001), higher cumulative incidence of relapse (26% vs. 15%, *P* < .001) and higher treatment-related mortality (7% vs. < 1%, *P* < .001) compared with patients without Down syndrome.[[71](#cit/section_4.71)] Among the patients with Down syndrome, age younger than 6 years, WBC count of less than 10,000/µL, and the presence of the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion (observed in 8% of patients) were independent predictors of favorable EFS.
- In a report from the COG, among patients with B-ALL who lacked *KMT2A* rearrangements, *BCR*::*ABL1*, *ETV6*::*RUNX1*, and hyperdiploidy with trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10, the EFS and OS rates were similar in children with and without Down syndrome.[[70](#cit/section_4.70)]
- Certain genomic abnormalities, such as *IKZF1* deletions, *CRLF2* aberrations, and *JAK* variants, are seen more frequently in ALL arising in children with Down syndrome than in those without Down syndrome.[[73](#cit/section_4.73)-[77](#cit/section_4.77)] Studies of children with Down syndrome and ALL suggest that the presence of *IKZF1* deletions (but not *CRLF2* aberrations or *JAK* variants) is associated with an inferior prognosis.[[71](#cit/section_4.71),[77](#cit/section_4.77),[78](#cit/section_4.78)]
- A retrospective analysis included 130 patients with *CRLF2*-rearranged ALL and Down syndrome. Patients with the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like signature (25% of the *CRLF2*-rearranged cases) had an inferior outcome compared with those who lacked the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like signature (EFS rates, 39.5% ± 8.1% vs. 82.0% ± 4.4%; hazard ratio [HR], 5.27).[[72](#cit/section_4.72)]
- The *IGH*::*IGF2BP1* gene fusion occurs in approximately 3% of patients with Down syndrome. This fusion is rare in patients with ALL who do not have Down syndrome. In one retrospective analysis, the fusion was associated with a relatively favorable outcome (EFS rate, 87.5% ± 1.7%).[[72](#cit/section_4.72)]

##### Sex

In some studies, the prognosis for girls with ALL is slightly better than it is for
boys with ALL.[[79](#cit/section_4.79)-[81](#cit/section_4.81)] One reason is the
occurrence of testicular relapses among boys, but boys also appear to be at
increased risk of bone marrow and CNS relapse for reasons that are not well
understood.[[79](#cit/section_4.79)-[81](#cit/section_4.81)] While some reports describe outcomes for boys as closely approaching those of girls,[[23](#cit/section_4.23),[57](#cit/section_4.57),[82](#cit/section_4.82)] larger clinical trial experiences and national data continue to show somewhat lower survival rates for boys.[[22](#cit/section_4.22),[33](#cit/section_4.33),[83](#cit/section_4.83),[84](#cit/section_4.84)]

##### Race and ethnicity

Over the last several decades in the United States, survival rates in Black and Hispanic children with ALL have been somewhat lower than
those in White children with ALL.[[85](#cit/section_4.85)-[88](#cit/section_4.88)] One study included more than 18,031 patients with B-ALL and 1,892 patients with T-ALL who were aged 0 to 30 years and treated between 2004 and 2019 in COG clinical trials. The race- and ethnicity-based outcome disparities noted in older studies persisted with more contemporary therapy. Race- and ethnicity-based outcome disparities were observed for patients with B-ALL but not for patients with T-ALL. The study also noted a wider disparity in OS versus EFS for patients with B-ALL, suggesting that disparities might be greater in the setting of relapsed disease versus newly diagnosed disease.[[89](#cit/section_4.89)] Multivariable analysis adjusting for disease prognosticators (e.g., age and WBC count, cytogenetic risk group, CNS status) and insurance status substantially attenuated the increased risk of inferior EFS for Hispanic patients. However, the same adjustments did not attenuate the inferior EFS for non-Hispanic Black children.[[89](#cit/section_4.89)]

The following factors associated with race and ethnicity influence survival:

- **ALL subtype.** The reason for better outcomes
in White and Asian children than in Black and Hispanic children is at least partially explained by the different spectrum of ALL subtypes. For example, Black children have a higher relative incidence of T-ALL, lower rates of favorable genetic subtypes of B-ALL, and higher rates of the *TFC3*::*PBX1* (t(1;19)) translocation. Hispanic and Latino children have a lower prevalence of the favorable *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion gene.[[90](#cit/section_4.90)]

Hispanic and Latino children have a higher frequency of *CRLF2* rearrangements and *IKZF1* deletions.[[90](#cit/section_4.90)-[92](#cit/section_4.92)] They also have a higher frequency of the IKZF1PLUS profile (*IKZF1* deletion plus deletion of *CDKN2A*, *CDKN2B*, *PAX5*, or *PAR1* [in the absence of *ERG* deletion]).[[90](#cit/section_4.90)]
- **Treatment adherence.** Differences in outcome may also be related to treatment adherence, as illustrated by a study of adherence to oral mercaptopurine (6-MP) in maintenance therapy. In the first report from the study, there was an increased risk of relapse in Hispanic children compared with non-Hispanic White children, depending on the level of adherence, even when adjusting for other known variables. However, even with adherence rates of 90% or more, Hispanic children continued to demonstrate increased rates of relapse.[[93](#cit/section_4.93)] In the second report from the study, adherence rates were shown to be significantly lower in Asian American and African American patients than in non-Hispanic White patients. A greater percentage of patients in these ethnic groups had adherence rates of less than 90%, which was associated with a 3.9-fold increased risk of relapse.[[94](#cit/section_4.94)]
- **Ancestry-related genomic variations.** Ancestry-related genomic variations may also contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in both the incidence and outcome of ALL.[[95](#cit/section_4.95)] For example, the differential presence of specific host polymorphisms in different racial and ethnic groups may contribute to outcome disparities, as illustrated by the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the *ARID5B* gene that occur more frequently among Hispanic patients and are linked to both ALL susceptibility and to relapse hazard.[[96](#cit/section_4.96)] In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), the *GATA3* variant, rs3824662, was associated with an increased risk of developing *BCR*::*ABL1*-like (Ph-like) ALL. Patients with this variant were at increased risk of high minimal residual disease (MRD) at end-induction and at greater risk of relapse. The rs3824662 risk allele is associated with Native American genetic ancestry. The risk allele frequency was 52% in Guatemalan patients, 40% in U.S. Hispanic patients, and 14% in patients of European descent.[[97](#cit/section_4.97)]

##### Weight at diagnosis and during treatment

Studies of the impact of obesity on the outcome of ALL have had variable results. In most of these studies, obesity is defined as weight above the 95th percentile for age and height.

- Three studies did not demonstrate an independent effect of obesity on EFS.[[98](#cit/section_4.98)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[99](#cit/section_4.99),[100](#cit/section_4.100)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- Two studies showed obesity to be an independent prognostic factor only in patients older than 10 years or in patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease.[[101](#cit/section_4.101),[102](#cit/section_4.102)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- The COG reported on the impact of obesity on outcome in 2,008 children, 14% of whom were obese, who were enrolled on a high-risk ALL trial ([CCG-1961 [NCT00002812]](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002812)).[[103](#cit/section_4.103)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Obesity was found to be an independent variable for inferior outcome compared with nonobese patients (5-year EFS rates, 64% vs. 74%; *P* = .002). However, obese patients at diagnosis who then lost weight during the premaintenance period of treatment had outcomes similar to patients with normal weight at diagnosis.
- In a retrospective study of patients treated at a single institution, obesity at diagnosis was linked to an increased risk of having MRD at the end of induction and an inferior EFS.[[104](#cit/section_4.104)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- In a different retrospective study of 373 patients treated at a single institution, body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis was not associated with MRD at days 19 and 46, cumulative incidence of relapse, or EFS. OS was lower in patients with a high BMI, primarily resulting from treatment-related mortality and inferior salvage after relapse.[[105](#cit/section_4.105)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- In one study, obesity at diagnosis was associated with increased toxicity and truncated administration of asparaginase, especially in older children and adolescents.[[106](#cit/section_4.106)]
- In a study of 388 patients aged 15 to 50 years who were treated with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL consortium regimens, greater BMI was associated with higher rates of relapse and nonrelapse mortality, as well as inferior OS. Higher BMI was associated with increased rates of hepatotoxicity and hyperglycemia. The deleterious effect of elevated BMI was more pronounced in older patients. Among patients aged 15 to 29 years at diagnosis (n = 254), the 4-year OS rate was 73% for those with high BMI, compared with 83% for those with BMI in the reference range (*P* = .09).[[107](#cit/section_4.107)]

In a study of 762 pediatric patients with ALL (aged 2–17 years), the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group found that those who were underweight at diagnosis (defined as BMI standard deviation score < -1.8; 8% of the population) had an almost twofold higher risk of relapse compared with patients who were not underweight (after adjusting for risk group and age), although this did not result in a difference in EFS or OS. Patients with a decrease in BMI during the first 32 weeks of treatment had similar rates of relapse as other patients, but had significantly worse OS, primarily because of poorer salvage rates after relapse.[[108](#cit/section_4.108)]

#### Leukemic characteristics

Leukemic cell characteristics affecting prognosis include the following:

1. [Immunophenotype](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1313).
2. [Cytogenetics/genomic alterations](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1314).

##### Immunophenotype

The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia classifies ALL as either B-lymphoblastic leukemia or T-lymphoblastic leukemia, with further subdivisions based on molecular characteristics.[[109](#cit/section_4.109),[110](#cit/section_4.110)] For more information, see the [Diagnosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_552) section.

Either B- or T-lymphoblastic leukemia can coexpress myeloid antigens. These cases need to be distinguished from leukemia of ambiguous lineage.

1. **B-ALL (WHO B-lymphoblastic leukemia).**

Before 2008, the WHO classified B-lymphoblastic leukemia as precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and this terminology is still frequently used in the literature of childhood ALL to distinguish it from mature B-cell ALL. Mature B-cell ALL is now termed Burkitt leukemia and requires different treatment than has been given for B-ALL (precursor B-cell ALL).

B-ALL, defined by the expression
of CD19, HLA-DR, cytoplasmic CD79a, and other B-cell–associated antigens, accounts for
80% to 85% of childhood ALL. Approximately 90% of B-ALL cases express the CD10 surface antigen (formerly known as common ALL antigen). Absence of CD10 is often associated with *KMT2A* rearrangements, particularly t(4;11)(q21;q23), and a poor outcome.[[10](#cit/section_4.10),[111](#cit/section_4.111)] It is not clear whether CD10 negativity has any independent prognostic significance in the absence of a *KMT2A* gene rearrangement.[[112](#cit/section_4.112)]

The major immunophenotypic subtypes of B-ALL are as follows:

- Common B-ALL (CD10 positive and no surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin [Ig]).

Approximately three-quarters of patients with B-ALL have the common precursor B-cell immunophenotype and have the best prognosis. Patients with favorable cytogenetics almost always show a common precursor B-cell immunophenotype.
- Pro-B ALL (CD10 negative and no surface or cytoplasmic Ig).

Approximately 5% of patients have the pro-B immunophenotype. Pro-B is the most common immunophenotype seen in infants and is often associated with *KMT2A* gene rearrangements.
- Pre-B ALL (presence of
cytoplasmic Ig).

The leukemic cells of patients with pre-B ALL contain cytoplasmic Ig, and 25% of patients with pre-B ALL have the t(1;19)(q21;p13) translocation with the *TCF3*::*PBX1* fusion.[[113](#cit/section_4.113),[114](#cit/section_4.114)]

Approximately 3% of patients have transitional pre-B ALL with expression of surface Ig heavy chain in the absence of Ig light chain expression, *MYC* gene involvement, and L3 morphology. Patients with this phenotype respond well to therapy used for B-ALL.[[115](#cit/section_4.115)]
- Mature B-ALL (Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia).

Approximately 2% of patients
present with mature B-cell leukemia (surface Ig expression, generally with French-American-British criteria L3
morphology and an 8q24 translocation involving *MYC*), also called Burkitt leukemia. The treatment for mature B-cell ALL is based on therapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is completely different from the treatment for B-ALL. Rare cases of mature B-cell leukemia that lack surface Ig but
have L3 morphology with *MYC* gene translocations should also be treated as mature B-cell leukemia.[[115](#cit/section_4.115)] For more information about the
treatment of children with mature B-cell lymphoma/leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, see [Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq).

A small number of cases of *IG*::*MYC*-translocated leukemias with precursor B-cell immunophenotype (e.g., absence of CD20 expression and surface Ig expression) have been reported.[[116](#cit/section_4.116)] These cases presented in both children and adults. Like Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, they had a male predominance and most patients showed L3 morphology. The cases lacked variants in genes recurrently altered in Burkitt lymphoma (e.g., *ID3*, *CCND3*, or *MYC*), whereas variants in RAS genes (frequently altered in B-ALL) were common. The clinical significance and optimal therapy of *IG*::*MYC*–translocated leukemias with precursor B-cell phenotype and molecular characteristics requires further study.
2. **T-ALL.**

T-ALL is defined by expression of the
T-cell–associated antigens (cytoplasmic CD3, with CD7 plus CD2 or CD5) on leukemic blasts. T-ALL is frequently associated
with a constellation of clinical features, including the following:[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[39](#cit/section_4.39),[82](#cit/section_4.82)]

- Male sex.
- Older age.
- Leukocytosis.
- Mediastinal mass.

While not true historically, with appropriately intensive
therapy, children with T-ALL now have an outcome approaching that of
children with B-ALL.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[39](#cit/section_4.39),[42](#cit/section_4.42),[43](#cit/section_4.43),[82](#cit/section_4.82),[117](#cit/section_4.117)]

There are few commonly accepted prognostic factors for patients with T-ALL. Conflicting data exist regarding the prognostic significance of presenting leukocyte counts in T-ALL.[[38](#cit/section_4.38)-[45](#cit/section_4.45),[118](#cit/section_4.118)] The presence or absence of a mediastinal mass at diagnosis has no prognostic significance. In patients with a mediastinal mass, the rate of regression of the mass lacks prognostic significance.[[119](#cit/section_4.119)]

**Early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL.**

ETP ALL, a distinct subset of childhood T-ALL, was initially defined by identifying T-ALL cases with gene expression profiles highly related to expression profiles for normal early T-cell precursors.[[120](#cit/section_4.120)] The subset of T-ALL cases identified by these analyses represented 13% of all cases, and are characterized by a distinctive immunophenotype (CD1a and CD8 negativity, with weak expression of CD5 and coexpression of stem cell or myeloid markers). Another subgroup of T-ALL, called near-ETP ALL, has a similar immunophenotype as ETP ALL, except with strong CD5 expression. This subtype represents approximately 15% of cases.[[46](#cit/section_4.46)]

Initial reports describing ETP ALL suggested that this subset of patients has a poorer prognosis than other patients with T-ALL.[[120](#cit/section_4.120)-[122](#cit/section_4.122)] In addition, studies have reported that patients with ETP and near-ETP ALL have a slower early response and higher frequency of induction failure.[[45](#cit/section_4.45),[46](#cit/section_4.46)] However, despite higher rates of end-induction MRD and induction failure in these patients, the ETP and near-ETP subtypes do not appear to be independent predictors of inferior EFS or OS.[[46](#cit/section_4.46),[123](#cit/section_4.123)] For instance, in a study from the U.K. Medical Research Council, the ETP ALL subgroup of patients had nonsignificantly inferior 5-year EFS rates compared with non-ETP patients (76% vs. 84%).[[123](#cit/section_4.123)] Similarly, in the COG [AALL0434 [NCT00408005]](/clinicaltrials/NCT00408005) trial, neither ETP nor near-ETP status had a statistically significant impact on EFS on multivariable analysis.[[46](#cit/section_4.46)] Based on these results, most ALL treatment groups do not change patient treatment based on ETP status.
3. **Myeloid antigen expression.**

Up to one-third of childhood ALL patients have leukemia
cells that express myeloid-associated surface antigens. Myeloid-associated antigen expression
appears to be associated with specific ALL subgroups, notably those with *KMT2A* rearrangements, *ETV6*::*RUNX1*, and *BCR*::*ABL1*.[[124](#cit/section_4.124)-[126](#cit/section_4.126)] Patients with B-ALL who have gene rearrangements involving *ZNF384* also commonly show myeloid antigen expression.[[127](#cit/section_4.127),[128](#cit/section_4.128)] No independent adverse prognostic significance exists for
myeloid-surface antigen expression.[[124](#cit/section_4.124),[125](#cit/section_4.125)]

For information about leukemia of ambiguous lineage, see the [2016 WHO Classification of Acute Leukemias of Ambiguous Lineage](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2083) section.

##### Cytogenetics/genomic alterations

For information about B-ALL and T-ALL cytogenetics/genomics
and gene polymorphisms in drug metabolic pathways, see the [Cytogenetics/Genomics of Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2077) section.

#### Response to initial treatment

The rapidity with which leukemia cells are eliminated after initiation of
treatment and the level of residual disease at the end of induction are associated with long-term outcome. Because treatment response is influenced by the drug sensitivity of leukemic cells and host pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics,[[129](#cit/section_4.129)] early response has strong prognostic significance. Various ways of evaluating the
leukemia cell response to treatment have been used, including the following:

1. [MRD determination in bone marrow at the end of induction (EOI) and end of consolidation (EOC)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1315).
2. [Day 7 and day 14 bone marrow responses](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1316).
3. [Peripheral blood response to steroid prophase](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1317).
4. [Peripheral blood response to multiagent induction therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1318).
5. [Peripheral blood MRD before end of induction (day 8, day 15)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1557).
6. [Persistent leukemia at the end of induction (induction failure)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1319).

##### MRD determination in bone marrow at the end of induction (EOI) and end of consolidation (EOC)

Morphological assessment of residual leukemia in blood or bone marrow is often difficult and is relatively insensitive. Traditionally, a cutoff of 5% blasts in the bone marrow (detected by light microscopy) has been used to determine remission status. This corresponds to a level of 1 in 20 malignant cells. To detect lower levels of leukemic cells in either blood or marrow, specialized techniques are required. Such techniques include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, which determine unique Ig/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and fusion transcripts produced by chromosome translocations, or flow cytometric assays, which detect leukemia-specific immunophenotypes. With these techniques, detection of as few as 1 leukemia cell in 100,000 normal cells is possible, and MRD at the level of 1 in 10,000 cells (1 × 10-4 or 0.01%) can be detected routinely.[[130](#cit/section_4.130)] Newer techniques involving high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of Ig/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements can increase sensitivity of MRD detection to 1 in 1 million cells (1 × 10-6 or 0.0001%).[[131](#cit/section_4.131)]

Multiple studies have demonstrated that EOI MRD is an important, independent predictor of outcome in children and adolescents with B-lineage ALL.[[132](#cit/section_4.132)-[134](#cit/section_4.134)] MRD response discriminates outcome in subsets of patients defined by age, leukocyte count, and cytogenetic abnormalities.[[135](#cit/section_4.135)] In general, patients with higher levels of EOI MRD have a poorer prognosis than do those with lower or undetectable levels.[[130](#cit/section_4.130),[132](#cit/section_4.132)-[134](#cit/section_4.134)] However, the absolute risk of relapse associated with specific MRD levels varies by genetic subtype. For example, at any given level of detectable EOI MRD, patients with favorable cytogenetics, such as *ETV6*::*RUNX1* or high hyperdiploidy, have a lower absolute risk of subsequent relapse than do other patients, while patients with high-risk cytogenetics have a higher absolute risk of subsequent relapse than do other patients.[[136](#cit/section_4.136)] This observation may have important implications when MRD is used to develop risk classification plans.

EOI MRD is used by almost all groups as a factor in determining the intensity of postinduction treatment. Patients found to have higher EOI MRD levels (typically >0.1% to 0.01%) are allocated to more intensive therapies.[[130](#cit/section_4.130),[133](#cit/section_4.133),[137](#cit/section_4.137)]; [[138](#cit/section_4.138)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

A study of 619 children with ALL compared the prognostic utility of MRD by flow cytometry with the more sensitive HTS assay. Using an EOI MRD cut point level of 0.01%, HTS identified approximately 30% more cases as positive (i.e., >0.01%). Patients identified as positive by HTS but negative by flow cytometry had an intermediate prognosis, compared with patients categorized as either positive or negative by both methods. Patients meeting the criteria for standard-risk ALL with undetectable MRD by HTS had an especially good prognosis (5-year EFS rate, 98.1%).[[131](#cit/section_4.131)]

MRD levels obtained 10 to 12 weeks after the start of treatment (EOC) have also been shown to be prognostically important. Patients with high levels of EOC MRD have a significantly inferior EFS compared with other patients.[[134](#cit/section_4.134),[135](#cit/section_4.135),[139](#cit/section_4.139)] In one study by the Dutch Children's Oncology Group, patients with low but detectable EOC MRD (<0.05%, assessed by Ig/TR PCR assay) fared as well as those with nondetectable MRD at this time point, if their subsequent MRD assessments were negative. However, these patients did poorly if their subsequent MRD assessments remained detectable by the PCR assay.[[140](#cit/section_4.140)]

- **B-ALL.** For patients with B-ALL, evaluating MRD at two time points (EOI and EOC) can identify the following three prognostically distinct patient subsets:[[135](#cit/section_4.135)]

1. Low or undetectable EOI MRD: Best prognosis.
2. High EOI MRD but low or negative EOC MRD: Intermediate prognosis.
3. High EOC MRD (week 10–12 of therapy): Worst prognosis. The prognostic impact of EOC MRD is modulated by NCI risk criteria. NCI high-risk patients with high EOC MRD have DFS rates lower than NCI standard-risk patients who have similar MRD levels at this time point.[[139](#cit/section_4.139)]
- **T-ALL.** There are fewer studies documenting the prognostic significance of MRD in patients with T-ALL. The United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (UKALL) group reported that T-ALL patients with nondetectable EOI MRD had excellent outcomes, while those with very high MRD levels (>5%) at EOI had a poor prognosis. However, for all other T-ALL patients, an association between EOI MRD level and relapse risk was not found.[[136](#cit/section_4.136)] The DFCI ALL consortium also reported that T-ALL patients with very low EOI MRD (<10-4) had a very favorable outcome.[[45](#cit/section_4.45)] In the COG AALL0434 trial, high EOI MRD (>0.1%) was an independent predictor of inferior EFS and OS for patients with T-ALL on multivariable analysis.[[46](#cit/section_4.46)] In this trial, high EOI MRD was associated with inferior EFS in patients with non-ETP and near-ETP T-ALL, but not in those meeting the immunophenotypic definition of ETP.[[46](#cit/section_4.46)]

Another study also indicated that MRD at a later time point may be more prognostically significant in T-ALL.[[141](#cit/section_4.141)] In the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) [ALL-BFM-2000 (NCT00430118)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00430118) trial, MRD status at day 78 (week 12) was the most important predictor for relapse in patients with T-ALL.[[141](#cit/section_4.141)] Patients with detectable MRD at EOI who had negative MRD by day 78 generally had a favorable prognosis, similar to that of patients who achieved MRD-negativity at the earlier EOI time point.[[141](#cit/section_4.141)] In the COG AALL0434 trial, EOC MRD was evaluated in patients with T-ALL who had very high EOI MRD (>1%). High EOC MRD was associated with a markedly inferior outcome.[[46](#cit/section_4.46)] The COG AALL1231 study confirmed the prognostic significance of EOC marrow MRD for patients with T-ALL.[[142](#cit/section_4.142)]

MRD measurements, in conjunction with other presenting features, have also been used to identify subsets of patients with an extremely low risk of relapse. The COG reported a very favorable prognosis (5-year EFS rate, 97% ± 1%) for patients with precursor B-cell phenotype, NCI standard risk age/leukocyte count, CNS1 status, and favorable cytogenetic abnormalities (either high hyperdiploidy with favorable trisomies or the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion) who had less than 0.01% MRD levels at both day 8 (from peripheral blood) and EOI (from bone marrow).[[133](#cit/section_4.133)] The excellent outcomes in patients with low MRD at the EOI were sustained for more than 10 years from diagnosis.[[143](#cit/section_4.143)]

Modifying therapy on the basis of MRD determination has been shown to improve outcome.

- The [UKALL2003 (NCT00222612)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00222612) study demonstrated that reduction of therapy (i.e., one rather than two courses of delayed intensification) did not adversely impact outcome in non-high–risk patients with favorable EOI MRD.[[22](#cit/section_4.22)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] In a randomized controlled trial, the UKALL2003 study also demonstrated improved EFS for standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients who received augmented therapy if EOI MRD was greater than 0.01% (5-year EFS rates, 89.6% for augmented therapy vs. 82.8% for standard therapy).[[144](#cit/section_4.144)]
- The Dutch ALL10 trial stratified patients into the following three risk groups on the basis of MRD after the first month of treatment and after the second cycle of chemotherapy:[[145](#cit/section_4.145)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Standard risk (low MRD after the first month of treatment).
- Moderate risk (high MRD after the first month of treatment, low MRD after the second cycle of chemotherapy).
- High risk (high MRD after the second cycle of chemotherapy).

Compared with previous trials conducted by the same group, therapy was less intensive for standard-risk patients but more intensive for moderate-risk and high-risk patients. The overall 5-year EFS rate (87%) and OS rate (92%) were superior to the previous Dutch studies.
- In the DFCI ALL Consortium 05-001 trial, B-ALL patients with high EOI MRD (defined as ≥1 × 10-3) were classified as very high risk regardless of other presenting characteristics. These patients received an intensified cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone. The 5-year DFS rate for these patients was 77%, significantly better than outcome for such patients on previous trials, when EOI MRD was not used to stratify therapy.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)]

##### Day 7 and day 14 bone marrow responses

Patients who have a rapid reduction
in leukemia cells to less than 5% in their bone marrow within 7 or 14 days after the
initiation of multiagent chemotherapy have a more favorable prognosis than patients who have slower clearance of leukemia cells from the bone marrow.[[146](#cit/section_4.146)] MRD assessments at the EOI therapy have generally replaced day 7 and day 14 morphological assessments as response to therapy prognostic indicators because the latter lose their prognostic significance in multivariate analysis once MRD is included in the analyses.[[133](#cit/section_4.133),[147](#cit/section_4.147)]

##### Peripheral blood response to steroid prophase

Patients with a reduction in
peripheral blast count to less than 1,000/µL after a 7-day induction prophase
with prednisone and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate (a good prednisone
response) have a more favorable prognosis than patients whose peripheral blast
counts remain above 1,000/µL (a poor prednisone response).[[21](#cit/section_4.21)] Poor prednisone response is observed in fewer than 10% of patients.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[148](#cit/section_4.148)] Treatment
stratification for protocols of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) clinical trials group historically were partially based
on early response to the 7-day prednisone prophase (administered immediately before the initiation of multiagent remission induction). The current trial being conducted by that group still uses prednisone response to risk-stratify patients with T-ALL but not B-ALL.

##### Peripheral blood response to multiagent induction therapy

Patients with
persistent circulating leukemia cells at 7 to 10 days after the initiation of
multiagent chemotherapy are at increased risk of relapse, compared with patients
who have clearance of peripheral blasts within 1 week of therapy
initiation.[[149](#cit/section_4.149)] Rate of clearance of peripheral blasts has been found to be
of prognostic significance in both T-cell and B-lineage ALL.[[149](#cit/section_4.149)]

##### Peripheral blood MRD before EOI (day 8, day 15)

MRD measured in peripheral blood obtained 1 week after the initiation of multiagent induction chemotherapy has also been evaluated as an early response-to-therapy prognostic factor.

- In a COG study involving nearly 2,000 children with ALL, the presence of MRD in the peripheral blood at day 8 was associated with adverse prognosis. Increasing MRD levels were associated with a progressively poorer outcome.[[133](#cit/section_4.133)]
- In multivariate analysis, EOI MRD was the most powerful prognostic factor, but day 8 peripheral blood MRD maintained its prognostic significance, as did NCI risk group and the presence of favorable trisomies. A smaller study assessed the prognostic significance of peripheral blood MRD at day 15 after 1 week of a steroid prophase and 1 week of multiagent induction therapy.[[150](#cit/section_4.150)] This study also observed multivariate significance for peripheral blood MRD levels after 1 week of multiagent induction therapy.

Both studies identified a group of patients who achieved low MRD levels after 1 week of multiagent induction therapy who had a low rate of subsequent treatment failure.

##### Persistent leukemia at the EOI (induction failure)

Nearly all children with ALL achieve complete morphological remission by the end of the first month of treatment. The presence of greater than 5% lymphoblasts by morphological assessment at the EOI phase is observed in 1% to 2% of children with ALL.[[22](#cit/section_4.22),[23](#cit/section_4.23),[151](#cit/section_4.151)-[153](#cit/section_4.153)]

Features associated with a higher risk of induction failure include the following:[[153](#cit/section_4.153)-[155](#cit/section_4.155)]

- T-cell phenotype, especially the ETP phenotype.[[46](#cit/section_4.46)]
- Higher WBC at diagnosis for patients with B-ALL.
- Older age.
- Unfavorable biology.

- *KMT2A* rearrangement.
- *BCR*::*ABL1* rearrangement (before the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors).
- Rearrangement of *PDGFRB* (most commonly *EBF1*::*PDGFRB*), commonly associated with the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like subtype.[[153](#cit/section_4.153),[156](#cit/section_4.156)] These patients represent less than 1% of B-ALL cases in children but account for as much as 10% of induction failure cases.[[153](#cit/section_4.153)] In one retrospective study, 43 of 49 patients (88%) with *PDGFRB* fusions had EOI MRD levels greater than 1%.[[157](#cit/section_4.157)]

In a large retrospective study, the OS rate of patients with induction failure was only 32%.[[151](#cit/section_4.151)] However, there was significant clinical and biological heterogeneity. A relatively favorable outcome was observed in patients with B-ALL between the ages of 1 and 5 years without adverse cytogenetics (*KMT2A* rearrangement or *BCR*::*ABL1*). This group had a 10-year survival rate exceeding 50%, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in first remission was not associated with a survival advantage compared with chemotherapy alone for this subset. Patients with the poorest outcomes (10-year survival rate, <20%) included those who were aged 14 to 18 years, or who had the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion or *KMT2A* rearrangement. B-ALL patients younger than 6 years and T-ALL patients (regardless of age) appeared to have better outcomes if treated with allogeneic HSCT after achieving CR than those who received further treatment with chemotherapy alone.[[151](#cit/section_4.151)] However, in the COG [AALL0434 (NCT00408005)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00408005) study, an advantage for HSCT in first CR for T-ALL patients with induction failure (defined as M3 marrow at EOI) was not observed. In this study, T-ALL patients were assigned to receive nelarabine during several postinduction treatment phases and high-dose methotrexate during the first interim maintenance phase. The 5-year EFS rate of these patients was 53.1%, with no significant difference between those who proceeded to HSCT in first CR (n = 20) and those who did not (n = 23) (*P* = .42).[[158](#cit/section_4.158)]

##### Flow cytometry versus morphology

MRD is now being integrated with morphological assessment into the response to induction therapy, on the basis of studies that showed that patients with MRD levels above 5%, despite morphological CR, had outcomes similar to patients with morphological induction failure.

1. In the [UKALL2003 (NCT00222612)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00222612) study, 59 of 3,113 patients (1.9%) had morphological induction failure.[[153](#cit/section_4.153)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 51%, and the OS rate was 58%.
- 2.3% of patients had a morphological remission but had MRD of ≥5% measured by real-time quantitative IgH–T-cell receptor PCR. This group had a 5-year EFS rate of 47%, similar to those with morphological induction failure.
- The authors suggested that using both morphological and MRD criteria to define induction failure would more precisely identify patients with poor outcomes.
2. A study of 9,350 patients enrolled on COG clinical trials between 2004 and 2014 compared characteristics of patients and their outcomes categorized by morphology (M1 vs. M2/M3) and MRD status assessed by flow cytometry (<5% vs. ≥5%). Morphological remission (M1 status) was achieved for 98.6% of B-ALL patients and 93.8% of T-ALL patients at the EOI.[[159](#cit/section_4.159)]

- Morphology and MRD were concordant in 97.4% of children. However, only 87.3% of T-ALL patients were M1 with MRD of <5%, while 97.8% of B-ALL patients were in concordant remission.
- Approximately 20% of patients (40 of 202) with M2/M3 morphology had MRD of <5%. B-ALL patients with M2/M3 morphology but MRD of <5% had a 5-year OS rate of 72.7%, which was inferior to that of patients concordantly in remission (5-year OS rate, 93.8%) but superior to that of patients with M3 marrow (5-year OS rate, 43.4%).
- Among B-ALL and T-ALL patients with M1 marrow, 0.9% of B-ALL patients and 6.9% of T-ALL patients had MRD of ≥5%. Their outcome was compared with that of patients with M1 marrow and MRD of <5% and are shown in [Table 5](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2197) below.
- [Table 5](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2197) shows that for children with B-ALL with M1 marrow and MRD of ≥5%, the 5-year EFS rate was significantly inferior to that of children concordantly in remission (59.1% vs. 87.1%) but was superior to that of children concordantly not in remission (M2 with MRD ≥5%: 5-year EFS rate, 39.1%).
- The impact on EFS for MRD of ≥5% for children with B-ALL in morphological remission was driven by NCI high-risk patients, as there was no significant difference in EFS between NCI standard-risk patients in morphological remission with or without MRD of ≥5%.
- Inferior EFS rates were also observed for patients with T-ALL with M1 marrow and MRD of ≥5% compared with those in concordant remission (87.6% vs. 80.3%). However, outcome for T-ALL patients not in remission (whether by morphology or MRD or both) was superior to that of comparable patients with B-ALL.
- Factors predictive of discordant MRD (≥5%) for patients in morphological remission at EOI included age 10 years and older, WBC count at presentation of 50,000/µL or higher, neutral or unfavorable cytogenetics, and ETP ALL (for patients with T-ALL).

### Prognostic (Risk) Groups

For decades, clinical trial groups studying childhood ALL have used risk classification schemes to assign patients to therapeutic regimens on the basis of their estimated risk of treatment failure. Initial risk classification systems used clinical factors such as age and presenting WBC count. Response-to-therapy measures were subsequently added, with some groups using early morphological bone marrow response (e.g., at day 8 or day 15) and with other groups using response of circulating leukemia cells to single-agent prednisone. Contemporary risk classification systems continue to use clinical factors such as age and presenting WBC count and incorporate cytogenetics and genomic lesions of leukemia cells at diagnosis (e.g., favorable and unfavorable translocations) and response to therapy based on detection of MRD at EOI (and in some cases at later time points).[[141](#cit/section_4.141)] The risk classification systems of the COG and the BFM groups are briefly described below.

#### Children’s Oncology Group (COG) risk groups

In COG protocols, children with ALL are initially stratified into treatment groups (with varying degrees of risk of treatment failure) on the basis of a subset of prognostic factors, including the following:

- Age.
- WBC count at
diagnosis.
- Immunophenotype.
- Cytogenetics/genomic alterations.
- Presence of extramedullary disease.
- Down syndrome.
- Steroid pretreatment.

EFS rates exceed 85% in children meeting good-risk criteria (aged 1 to <10 years, WBC count <50,000/μL, and precursor B-cell immunophenotype). In children meeting high-risk criteria, EFS rates are approximately 75%.[[4](#cit/section_4.4),[57](#cit/section_4.57),[148](#cit/section_4.148),[160](#cit/section_4.160),[161](#cit/section_4.161)] Additional factors, including cytogenetic abnormalities and measures of early response to therapy (e.g., MRD levels in peripheral blood on day 8 and in bone marrow samples at the EOI), considered in conjunction with presenting age, WBC count, immunophenotype, the presence of extramedullary disease, and steroid pretreatment can identify patient groups for postinduction therapy with expected EFS
rates ranging from less than 40% to more than 95%.[[4](#cit/section_4.4),[133](#cit/section_4.133)]

Patients who are at very high risk of treatment failure include the following:[[162](#cit/section_4.162)-[165](#cit/section_4.165)]

- Infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements.
- Patients with hypodiploidy (<44 chromosomes).
- Patients with initial induction failure.

#### Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) risk groups

Since 2000, risk stratification on BFM protocols has been based on treatment response criteria, as well as biology. Treatment response is assessed primarily via MRD measurements at two time points, EOI (time point 1, week 5) and end of the IB phase (similar to COG consolidation phase) at week 12 (time point 2). High MRD at both time points is defined as higher than 5 × 10-4.

The BFM defines 3 risk groups based on early response:[[135](#cit/section_4.135)]

- **Standard risk:** Patients who have negative MRD at both time points.
- **Intermediate risk:** Patients who have high MRD at time point 1 and negative MRD at time point 2.
- **High risk:** Patients with high MRD at time point 2. Patients with T-ALL with a poor response to the prednisone prophase are also considered high risk, regardless of subsequent MRD.

Biological factors used to stratify patients as high risk (regardless of MRD at either time point) include *KMT2A::AFF1*, *TCF3::HLF*, and hypodiploidy (<45 chromosomes). Patients with *IKZF1*-plus status (*IKZF1* deletions that co-occurred with deletions in *CDKN2A*, *CDKN2B*, *PAX5*, or *PAR1* in the absence
of *ERG* deletion) [[166](#cit/section_4.166)] are considered high risk if they have high MRD at EOI, regardless of EOC MRD. Age, presenting leukocyte count, and CNS status at diagnosis do not factor into the current risk classification schema.

#### Prognostic (risk) groups under clinical evaluation

1. COG [AALL1731 (NCT03914625)](/clinicaltrials/NCT03914625) standard-risk and [AALL1732 (NCT03959085)](/clinicaltrials/NCT03959085) high-risk clinical trials: The COG classifies patients into six risk groups for patients with B-ALL (standard-risk favorable, standard-risk average, standard-risk high, high-risk favorable, high risk, and very high risk) on the basis of the following:

- Age and presenting leukocyte count (using NCI risk-group criteria).[[3](#cit/section_4.3)]

- NCI standard (low) risk: Includes children aged 1 year to <10 years with WBC <50,000/µL at the time of diagnosis.
- NCI high risk: Includes children aged ≥10 years and/or children who have WBC ≥50,000/µL at the time of diagnosis.
- Extramedullary disease (presence or absence of CNS and/or testicular leukemia).

- CNS1: Absence of blasts on CSF cytospin preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs.
- CNS2: Presence of <5 WBC/μL in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts; or traumatic LP, ≥5 WBC/μL, cytospin positive for blasts but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm.
- CNS3 is divided and defined as follows:

- CNS3a: <10 RBC/μL; ≥5 WBC/μL and cytospin positive for blasts.
- CNS3b: ≥10 RBC/μL; ≥5 WBC/μL and positive by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm.
- CNS3c: Clinical signs of CNS leukemia (such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement or hypothalamic syndrome).
- Genomic alterations in leukemia cells.
- Day 8 peripheral blood MRD.
- Day 29 bone marrow morphological response and MRD.
- EOC MRD.
- Steroid pretreatment.

Morphological assessment of early response in the bone marrow is no longer performed on days 8 and 15 of induction as part of risk stratification. Patients with T-cell phenotype are treated on separate trials and are not risk classified in this way.

For patients with B-ALL, the definitions of favorable, unfavorable, and neutral cytogenetics are as follows:

- Favorable cytogenetic features include the following:

- Hyperdiploidy with double trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10 (double trisomy); or
- *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion.
- Unfavorable cytogenetic features include the following:

- Hypodiploidy (<44 chromosomes or DNA index <0.81).
- *KMT2A* rearrangements.
- t(17;19)(q21-q22;p13.3) or resultant *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion transcript.
- Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21); and
- *BCR*::*ABL1* (Ph+ or t(9;22)(q34;q11)). Patients with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL are treated on a separate clinical trial.
- Neutral cytogenetics: Lacking favorable and unfavorable cytogenetic features.

NCI standard-risk patients are divided into a highly favorable group (standard-risk favorable; 5-year DFS rate, >95%), a group with favorable outcome (standard-risk average; 5-year DFS rate, 90%–95%), and a group with a 5-year DFS rate below 90% (standard-risk high). Patients classified as standard-risk high receive postinduction backbone chemotherapy as per high-risk B-ALL regimens with intensified consolidation, interim maintenance, and reinduction therapy. Criteria for these three groups are provided in [Table 6](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2198), [Table 7](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2199), and [Table 8](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2200) below.

High-risk favorable B-ALL is defined by the characteristics in [Table 9](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2190). These patients have an EFS rate higher than 90% on past COG clinical trials for high-risk patients.

Table 9. Characteristics of High-Risk Favorable B-ALL Patients

| NCI Risk Group | Age (y) | CNS Status | Testicular Leukemia | Steroid Pretreatment | Favorable Genetics (*ETV6*::*RUNX1* or DT) | Bone marrow MRD EOI |

High-risk B-ALL is defined by the characteristics in [Table 10](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2191). NCI standard-risk patients are elevated to high-risk status based on steroid pretreatment and CNS and/or testicular involvement.

NCI high-risk patients with EOC marrow MRD ≥0.01% are classified as very high risk and are eligible for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell clinical trial in first remission ([NCT03792633](/clinicaltrials/NCT03792633)).

Patients with B-ALL and Down syndrome are classified into risk groups similar to other children, but Down syndrome patients classified as high risk receive a treatment regimen that is modified to reduce toxicity.

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. [General information](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials") about clinical trials is also available.

## Treatment Option Overview for Childhood ALL

### Phases of Therapy

Treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is typically divided into the following phases:

1. [Remission induction chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_732) (at the time of diagnosis).
2. [Postinduction therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_857) (after achieving complete remission).

- [Consolidation/intensification therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1080).
- [Maintenance therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1092).

### Sanctuary Sites

Historically, certain extramedullary sites have been considered sanctuary sites (i.e., anatomic spaces that are poorly penetrated by many of the orally and intravenously administered chemotherapy agents typically used to treat ALL). The two most important sanctuary sites in childhood ALL are the central nervous system (CNS) and the testes. Successful treatment of ALL requires therapy that effectively addresses clinical or subclinical involvement of leukemia in these extramedullary sanctuary sites.

#### Central nervous system (CNS)

At diagnosis, approximately 3% of patients have CNS3 disease (defined as cerebrospinal fluid specimen with ≥5 white blood cells/μL with lymphoblasts and/or the presence of cranial nerve palsies). However, unless specific therapy is directed toward the CNS, most children will eventually develop overt CNS leukemia whether or not lymphoblasts were detected in the spinal fluid at initial diagnosis. CNS-directed treatments include intrathecal chemotherapy, CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy, and cranial radiation. Some or all of these treatments are included in current regimens for ALL. For more information, see the [CNS-Directed Therapy for Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_576) section.

#### Testes

Overt testicular involvement at the time of diagnosis occurs in approximately 2% of males. In early ALL trials, testicular involvement at diagnosis was an adverse prognostic factor. With more aggressive initial therapy, however, the prognostic significance of initial testicular involvement is unclear.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2)] The role of radiation therapy for testicular involvement is also unclear. A study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital suggests that a good outcome can be achieved with aggressive conventional chemotherapy without radiation.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] The Children's Oncology Group has also adopted this strategy for boys with testicular involvement that resolves completely during induction chemotherapy.

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With ALL

The treatment of children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) entails complicated risk assignment, extensive therapies, and intensive supportive care (e.g., transfusions; management of infectious complications; and emotional, financial, and developmental support). Because of these factors, the evaluation and treatment of these patients are best coordinated by a multidisciplinary team in cancer centers or hospitals with all of the necessary pediatric supportive care facilities.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation oncologists.
- Pediatric intensivists.
- Rehabilitation specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents with cancer.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] Treatment of childhood ALL typically involves chemotherapy given for 2 to 3 years. Because myelosuppression and generalized immunosuppression are anticipated consequences of leukemia and chemotherapy treatment, adequate facilities must be immediately available for both hematological support and treatment of infections and other complications throughout all phases of therapy. Approximately 1% to 3% of patients die during the remission induction phase, and another 1% to 3% die after having achieved complete remission from treatment-related complications.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)-[6](#cit/section_6.6)] It is important that the clinical centers and the specialists directing the patient’s care maintain contact with the referring physician in the community. Strong lines of communication optimize any urgent or interim care required when the child is at home.

Clinical trials are generally available for children with ALL, with specific protocols designed for children at standard (low) risk of treatment failure and for children at higher risk of treatment failure. Clinical trials for children with ALL are generally designed to compare standard therapy for a particular risk group with a potentially better treatment approach that may improve survival and/or diminish toxicities associated with the standard treatment regimen. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Many of the therapeutic innovations that produced increased survival rates in children with ALL were achieved through clinical trials, and it is appropriate for children and adolescents with ALL to be offered participation in a clinical trial. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Risk-based treatment assignment is an important therapeutic strategy for
children with ALL. This approach allows
children who historically have a very good outcome to be treated with less intensive therapy and to be
spared more toxic treatments, while children with a
historically lower probability of long-term survival receive more intensive
therapy that may increase their chance of cure. For more information about
clinical and laboratory features that have shown prognostic value, see the [Risk-Based Treatment Assignment](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_22) section.

## Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Childhood ALL

### Standard Induction Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed ALL

Standard treatment options for newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) include the following:

1. Chemotherapy.

#### Remission induction chemotherapy

The goal of the first phase of therapy (remission induction) is to induce a complete remission (CR). This induction phase typically lasts 4 weeks. Overall, approximately 98% of patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL achieve CR by the end of this phase, with somewhat lower rates in infants and in noninfant patients with T-ALL or high presenting leukocyte counts.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)-[5](#cit/section_7.5)]

Induction chemotherapy typically consists of the following drugs, with or without an anthracycline (either doxorubicin or daunorubicin):

- Vincristine.
- Corticosteroid (either prednisone or dexamethasone).
- Asparaginase.
- Intrathecal chemotherapy.

The Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols administer a three-drug induction (vincristine, corticosteroid, and pegaspargase) to National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard-risk B-ALL patients and a four-drug induction (vincristine, corticosteroid, and pegaspargase plus anthracycline) to NCI high-risk B-ALL and all T-ALL patients. Other groups use a four-drug induction for all patients.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)-[3](#cit/section_7.3)]

##### Corticosteroid therapy

Many current regimens use dexamethasone instead of prednisone during remission induction and later phases of therapy, although controversy exists as to whether dexamethasone benefits all subsets of patients. Some trials also suggest that dexamethasone during induction may be associated with more toxicity than prednisone, including higher rates of infection, myopathy, and behavioral changes.[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[6](#cit/section_7.6)-[8](#cit/section_7.8)] The COG reported that dexamethasone during induction was associated with a higher risk of osteonecrosis in older children (aged >10 years),[[8](#cit/section_7.8)] although this finding has not been confirmed in other randomized studies.[[1](#cit/section_7.1),[7](#cit/section_7.7)]

Evidence (dexamethasone vs. prednisone during induction):

1. The Children's Cancer Group conducted a randomized trial that compared dexamethasone and prednisone in standard-risk B-ALL patients receiving a three-drug induction without an anthracycline.[[6](#cit/section_7.6)]

- Dexamethasone was associated with a superior event-free survival (EFS).
- Dexamethasone was associated with a higher frequency of reversible steroid myopathy and hyperglycemia. No significant differences in rates of infection during induction were observed between the two randomized arms.
2. Another randomized trial that included both standard-risk and high-risk patients was conducted by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC).[[7](#cit/section_7.7)]

- The trial demonstrated that dexamethasone was associated with a more favorable outcome than prednisolone in all patient subgroups.
- Patients who received dexamethasone had a significantly lower incidence of both central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS relapses than did patients who received prednisolone.
- Dexamethasone was associated with a higher incidence of steroid-associated behavioral problems and myopathy, but an excess risk of osteonecrosis was not observed. There was no difference in induction death rates between the randomized groups.
3. The Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) [ALL-BFM-2000 (NCT00430118)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00430118) trial randomly assigned 3,720 patients to receive either dexamethasone (10 mg/m2/d) or prednisone (60 mg/m2/d) during multiagent remission induction (including an anthracycline for all patients) after a 7-day prednisone prophase.[[9](#cit/section_7.9)]

- Dexamethasone was associated with higher incidence of life-threatening events (primarily infections), resulting in a significantly higher induction death rate (2.5% for dexamethasone vs. 0.9% for prednisone; *P* = .00013).
- There was no difference in rates of osteonecrosis between the randomized groups.
- The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower with dexamethasone (11% vs. 16%; *P* < .0001), resulting in superior 5-year EFS rates (84% for dexamethasone vs. 81% for prednisone, *P* = .024) despite the increased induction death rate.
- No difference in overall survival (OS) was observed based on steroid randomization, although the study was not sufficiently powered to detect small differences in OS.
- In a predefined subgroup analysis, a survival benefit was observed with dexamethasone treatment in patients with T-ALL and a good response to the prednisone prophase (5-year OS rates, 91% with dexamethasone vs. 83% with prednisone, *P* = .036).
4. The COG conducted a randomized trial of dexamethasone and prednisone in NCI high-risk B-ALL patients.[[8](#cit/section_7.8)] Patients were randomly assigned to receive 14 days of dexamethasone or 28 days of prednisone during a four-drug induction (with an anthracycline). This trial also included a randomized comparison of high-dose and escalating-dose methotrexate during the interim maintenance phase.

- Dexamethasone was associated with a higher rate of infection, but there was no difference in the induction death rate when comparing dexamethasone and prednisone.
- For patients who were younger than 10 years at diagnosis, there was a significant interaction between the corticosteroid and methotrexate randomizations. However, the best outcome for this group of patients was observed in those who received both dexamethasone during induction and high-dose methotrexate during interim maintenance.
- The corticosteroid randomization was closed early for patients aged 10 years or older at diagnosis because of excessive rates of osteonecrosis in patients randomly assigned to dexamethasone. However, there was no EFS benefit associated with dexamethasone in these older patients (5-year EFS rates of 73.1% with dexamethasone and 73.9% with prednisone; *P* = .78)

The ratio of dexamethasone to prednisone dose used may influence outcome. Studies in which the dexamethasone to prednisone ratio was 1:5 to 1:7 have shown a better result for dexamethasone, while studies that used a 1:10 ratio have shown similar outcomes.[[10](#cit/section_7.10)]

##### Asparaginase

Several forms of asparaginase have been used in the treatment of
children with ALL, including the following:

- [Pegaspargase (PEG-asparaginase)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1387).
- [Calaspargase pegol](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2488).
- [Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinia L-asparaginase)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1388).
- Native *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) L-asparaginase (unavailable in the United States, but still available in other countries).

###### Pegaspargase (PEG-asparaginase)

Pegaspargase is a form of L-asparaginase in which the *E. coli*–derived enzyme is modified by the covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol. It is commonly used during both induction and postinduction phases of treatment in newly diagnosed patients treated in Western Europe. Pegaspargase is not available in the United States, but it is still available in other countries.

Pegaspargase may be given either intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV).[[11](#cit/section_7.11)] Pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles are similar for IM and IV pegaspargase administration.[[11](#cit/section_7.11)] There is no evidence that IV administration of pegaspargase is more toxic than IM administration.[[11](#cit/section_7.11)-[13](#cit/section_7.13)]

Pegaspargase has a much longer serum half-life than native *E. coli*
L-asparaginase, producing prolonged asparagine depletion after a single injection.[[14](#cit/section_7.14)]

Serum asparaginase enzyme activity levels of more than 0.1 IU/mL have been associated with serum asparagine depletion. Studies have shown that a single dose of pegaspargase given either IM or IV as part of multiagent induction results in serum enzyme activity of more than 0.1 IU/mL in nearly all patients for at least 2 to 3 weeks.[[11](#cit/section_7.11),[12](#cit/section_7.12),[15](#cit/section_7.15),[16](#cit/section_7.16)] In one study of 54 NCI high-risk patients conducted by the COG, plasma asparaginase activity as low as 0.02 IU/mL was associated with serum asparagine depletion. Using that cutoff value, it was estimated that 96% of patients maintained the therapeutic effect (plasma asparagine depletion) for 22 to 29 days after a single pegaspargase dose of 2,500 IU/m2.[[17](#cit/section_7.17)] In one randomized study, higher doses of pegaspargase (3,500 IU/m2) did not improve outcome when compared with standard doses (2,500 IU/m2).[[18](#cit/section_7.18)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

In another study, doses of pegaspargase were reduced in an attempt to decrease toxicity.[[19](#cit/section_7.19)] While lower doses were successful in maintaining appropriate asparaginase levels of more than 0.1 IU/mL, the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicities was similar to the frequency of toxicities reported in previous studies that used higher doses of pegaspargase. This study did not report on the impact of lower doses of pegaspargase on EFS.

Evidence (use of pegaspargase versus native *E. coli* L-asparaginase):

1. A randomized comparison of IV pegaspargase versus IM native *E. coli* asparaginase was conducted. Each agent was administered for a 30-week period after the achievement of CR.[[13](#cit/section_7.13)][[Level of evidence A3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810021&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Serum asparaginase activity (SAA) levels were significantly higher with IV pegaspargase and exceeded goal therapeutic levels (>0.1 IU/mL) in nearly all patients throughout the 30-week period.
- There was no significant difference in EFS and OS between the randomized arms.
- There was no difference in rates of asparaginase-related toxicities, including hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, and thromboembolic complications.
- Similar outcome and similar rates of asparaginase-related toxicities were observed for both groups of patients.
- IV pegaspargase was associated with less treatment-related anxiety, as assessed by patient and parent surveys.
2. Another randomized trial of patients with standard-risk ALL assigned patients to receive either pegaspargase or native *E. coli* asparaginase during induction and in each of two delayed intensification courses.[[15](#cit/section_7.15)]

- A single dose of pegaspargase given in conjunction with vincristine and prednisone during induction therapy appeared to have similar activity and toxicity as nine doses of IM *E. coli* L-asparaginase (3 times a week for 3 weeks).[[15](#cit/section_7.15)]
- The use of pegaspargase was associated with more rapid blast clearance and a lower incidence of neutralizing antibodies.

Patients with an allergic reaction to pegaspargase are typically switched to *Erwinia* L-asparaginase. A COG analysis investigated the deleterious effect on disease-free survival (DFS) of early discontinuation of treatment with pegaspargase in patients with high-risk B-ALL. The study found that the adverse effect on outcome could be reversed with the use of *Erwinia* L-asparaginase to complete the planned course of asparaginase therapy.[[20](#cit/section_7.20)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Measurement of SAA levels after a mild or questionable reaction to pegaspargase may help to differentiate patients for whom the switch to *Erwinia* is indicated (because of inadequate SAA) versus those for whom a change in preparation may not be necessary.[[21](#cit/section_7.21),[22](#cit/section_7.22)]

Evidence (adverse prognostic impact of early discontinuation of pegaspargase or silent inactivation of asparaginase):

1. Several studies have identified a subset of patients who experience silent inactivation of asparaginase, which is defined as the absence of therapeutic SAA levels without overt allergy.[[23](#cit/section_7.23),[24](#cit/section_7.24)]

- In a trial conducted by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Consortium, 12% of patients who were initially treated with native *E.coli* L-asparaginase demonstrated silent inactivation. These patients had a superior EFS if their asparaginase preparation was changed.[[24](#cit/section_7.24)]
- Patients who were treated with pegaspargase appear to have lower levels of silent inactivation (<10%).[[13](#cit/section_7.13),[23](#cit/section_7.23),[25](#cit/section_7.25)]

Determination of the optimal frequency of pharmacokinetic monitoring for pegaspargase-treated patients, and whether such screening impacts outcome, awaits further investigation.
2. A report from the COG included 8,196 patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL who were enrolled between 2004 to 2011.[[20](#cit/section_7.20)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The cumulative incidence of pegaspargase discontinuation (because of toxicity) was 12.2% in NCI standard-risk patients and 25.4% in NCI high-risk patients.
- In multivariable analysis, NCI high-risk patients who discontinued pegaspargase early had inferior DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; *P* = .002) than did those who received all prescribed doses. For NCI standard-risk patients, there was no impact of pegaspargase discontinuation on DFS, except in patients with slow-early response who received intensified postinduction therapy (HR, 1.7; *P* = .03).
- NCI high-risk patients who discontinued pegaspargase but then switched to *Erwinia* asparaginase and received all subsequent intended doses, did not have an increased risk of relapse (HR, 1.1; *P* = .69).
3. An analysis of 1,115 non–high-risk ALL patients from the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol reported the following:[[25](#cit/section_7.25)]

- 255 patients received a truncated asparaginase course because of toxicity, and 46 patients had evidence of silent inactivation on therapeutic drug monitoring.
- The 7-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 11.1% in the 301 patients who received a truncated asparaginase course, compared with 6.7% in the remaining 814 patients who received the planned courses (HR, 1.73; *P* = .03).
- In a Cox model, suboptimal asparaginase treatment (because of either truncated pegaspargase or silent inactivation) was significantly associated with a higher relapse risk (HR, 1.69; *P* = 0.03).

In an attempt to decrease hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase, the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group-ALL11 protocol randomly assigned patients to receive either continuous or noncontinuous dosing after induction therapy. The occurrence of inactivating hypersensitivity reactions was seven times lower and antibody levels were significantly lower in the continuous-dosing arm. There was no difference in total number of asparaginase toxicities or the 5-year incidences of relapse, death, or disease-free survival between the treatment arms.[[26](#cit/section_7.26)]

###### Calaspargase pegol

Calaspargase pegol is another formulation of pegylated asparaginase that is also available for the treatment of children and adolescents with ALL.[[27](#cit/section_7.27)] This formulation is similar in structure to pegaspargase, except with a different linker between the L-asparaginase enzyme and the PEG moiety, resulting in a longer half-life.[[28](#cit/section_7.28),[29](#cit/section_7.29)]

Evidence (calaspargase pegol vs. pegaspargase):

1. In a COG study, 165 patients with high-risk B-ALL were randomly assigned to receive either calaspargase pegol or pegaspargase during the induction phase of ALL therapy.[[28](#cit/section_7.28)]

- The mean half-life of calaspargase pegol was approximately 2.5 times longer than pegaspargase.
- The total systemic exposure to calaspargase pegol was greater than for pegaspargase.
- Twenty-five days after a dose of calaspargase pegol, 95% of patients maintained an asparaginase level higher than 0.1 IU/mL, compared with 28% of patients who received pegaspargase.
- Evidence of end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity was similar between the two drugs (74% and 72%).
- The toxicity profile of the two drugs was similar.
2. In a DFCI trial of calaspargase pegol in patients with newly diagnosed ALL, all patients received one dose of either calaspargase pegol or pegaspargase as part of induction therapy. After induction, 230 patients were randomly assigned to receive either calaspargase pegol every 3 weeks (10 doses) or pegaspargase every 2 weeks (15 doses).[[29](#cit/section_7.29)]

- At day 25 after the induction dose, 88% of patients who received calaspargase pegol had an asparaginase level higher than 0.1 IU/mL, compared with 17% of patients who received pegaspargase.
- There was no difference in end-of-induction MRD.
- There was no difference in the frequency of toxicities (37%).
- The 5-year EFS rates were similar for calaspargase pegol and pegaspargase (88.1% vs. 84.9%).

Calaspargase pegol has only been approved for use in the United States for patients younger than 22 years.

###### Asparaginase *Erwinia chrysanthemi* (*Erwinia* L-asparaginase)

*Erwinia* L-asparaginase is typically used in patients who have experienced an allergy to native *E. coli* or pegaspargase.

The half-life of *Erwinia* L-asparaginase (0.65 days) is much shorter than that of native *E. coli* (1.2 days) or pegaspargase (5.7 days).[[14](#cit/section_7.14)] If *Erwinia* L-asparaginase is used, the shorter half-life of the *Erwinia* preparation requires more frequent administration to achieve adequate asparagine depletion.

Evidence (increased dose frequency of *Erwinia* L-asparaginase needed to achieve goal therapeutic effect):

1. A COG trial demonstrated that IM *Erwinia* L-asparaginase given three times a week to patients with an allergy to pegaspargase leads to therapeutic serum asparaginase enzyme activity levels (defined as a level ≥0.1 IU/mL).[[30](#cit/section_7.30)]

- On this trial, 96% of children achieved a level of 0.1 IU/mL or more at 2 days after a dose of *Erwinia* L-asparaginase and 85% did so at 3 days after a dose.
2. A trial of IV *Erwinia* L-asparaginase given on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule to patients with an allergy to pegaspargase demonstrated therapeutic serum asparaginase enzyme activity (defined as ≥0.1 IU/mL) in 83% of patients 48 hours after a dose but in only 43% of patients 72 hours after a dose.[[31](#cit/section_7.31)]

- If IV *Erwinia* is given on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule, the authors suggest that 72-hour nadir enzyme activity levels be monitored to ensure therapeutic levels.

A recombinant form of *Erwinia* L-asparaginase, asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn, was studied in a phase II/III COG trial. When it was given on a Monday (25 mg/m2), Wednesday (25 mg/m2), and Friday (50 mg/m2) schedule for six doses, the proportion of patients who achieved asparaginase levels of 0.1 IU/mL or greater was 90% at 72 hours (44 of 49 patients) and 96% at 48 hours (47 of 49 patients). The safety profile was comparable with other forms of asparaginase.[[32](#cit/section_7.32)] In 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn for IM use in children and adults with ALL on the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule used in the COG trial.

##### Anthracycline use during induction

The COG protocols administer a three-drug induction (vincristine, corticosteroid, and pegaspargase) to NCI standard-risk B-ALL patients and a four-drug induction (vincristine, corticosteroid, and pegaspargase plus an anthracycline) to NCI high-risk B-ALL and all T-ALL patients. Other groups use a four-drug induction for all patients.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)-[3](#cit/section_7.3)]

In induction regimens that include an anthracycline, either daunorubicin or doxorubicin are typically used. In a randomized trial comparing the two agents during induction, there were no differences in early response measures, including reduction in peripheral blood blast counts during the first week of therapy, day 15 marrow morphology, and end-induction MRD levels.[[33](#cit/section_7.33)][[Level of evidence B3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810031&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

#### Response to remission induction chemotherapy

More than 95% of children with newly diagnosed ALL will achieve a CR within the first 4
weeks of treatment. Of those who fail to achieve CR within the first 4 weeks, approximately one-half will experience a toxic death during the induction phase (usually caused by infection) and the other half will have resistant disease (persistent morphological leukemia).[[34](#cit/section_7.34)-[36](#cit/section_7.36)]; [[37](#cit/section_7.37)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Remission is classically defined as an end-induction bone marrow examination by routine microscopic cytomorphology with fewer than 5% lymphoblasts at the end of induction (M1). The Ponte de Legno consortium includes approximately 15 large national and international cooperative groups devoted to the study and treatment of childhood ALL. This group published a consensus definition of complete remission, as follows:[[38](#cit/section_7.38)]

- Achievement of MRD levels of less than 1% and/or M1 cytomorphology.

- MRD is the gold standard and takes precedence over cytomorphology.
- MRD is determined by either flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction techniques.
- Resolution of extramedullary disease, assessed no earlier than the end of induction.

Most patients with persistence of morphologically detectable leukemia at the end of the 4-week induction phase have a poor
prognosis and may benefit from an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) once CR is achieved.[[4](#cit/section_7.4),[39](#cit/section_7.39),[40](#cit/section_7.40)] In a retrospective study of 1,041 patients with persistent disease after induction therapy (induction failure) who were treated between 1985 and 2000, the 10-year OS rate was 32%.[[41](#cit/section_7.41)] A trend for superior outcome with allogeneic HSCT compared with chemotherapy alone was observed in patients with T-cell phenotype (any age) and B-ALL patients older than 6 years. B-ALL patients who were aged 1 to 5 years at diagnosis and did not have any adverse cytogenetic abnormalities (*KMT2A* rearrangement, *BCR*::*ABL1*) had a relatively favorable prognosis, without any advantage in outcome with the utilization of HSCT compared with chemotherapy alone.[[41](#cit/section_7.41)]

A follow-up retrospective study reported the outcomes of 325 children and adolescents with T-ALL and initial induction failure who were treated between 2000 and 2018.[[42](#cit/section_7.42)] The 10-year OS rate was 54.7%, which was significantly better than the rates of patients in historical cohorts who were treated between 1985 and 2000 (10-year OS rate, 27.6%). Complete remission was eventually achieved in 93% of patients with T-ALL and initial induction failure. Of the patients who achieved complete remission, 72% underwent HSCT. Adjusting for time to transplant, the 10-year OS rate was 66.2% for these patients, compared with 50.8% for those who did not undergo transplants.

The incorporation of nelarabine may be of value for patients with T-ALL and have induction failure. The COG [AALL0434 (NCT00408005)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00408005) study included 43 patients with more than 25% blasts in an end-induction bone marrow aspirate. Of these patients, 23 patients were nonrandomly assigned to therapy that included high-dose methotrexate and nelarabine as part of a multidrug regimen, and 20 patients underwent allogeneic transplant. The 5-year EFS rate was 53.1% (± 9.4%) for the patients who received high-dose methotrexate and nelarabine. There was no difference in outcome for these two groups (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.24–1.83; *P* = .423).[[43](#cit/section_7.43)]

For patients who achieve CR, measures of the rapidity of blast clearance and MRD determinations have important prognostic significance, particularly the following:

- The percentage of morphologically detectable marrow blasts at 7 and 14 days after starting multiagent remission induction therapy has been correlated with relapse risk,[[44](#cit/section_7.44)] and has been used in the past by the COG to risk-stratify patients. However, in multivariate analyses, when end-induction MRD is included, these early marrow findings lose their prognostic significance.[[45](#cit/section_7.45),[46](#cit/section_7.46)]
- End-induction levels of submicroscopic MRD, assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, or next-generation sequencing assays strongly correlates with long-term outcome.[[45](#cit/section_7.45),[47](#cit/section_7.47)-[50](#cit/section_7.50)] Intensification of postinduction therapy for patients with high levels of end-induction MRD is a common component of most ALL treatment regimens. In a randomized trial conducted by the United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (UKALL) group, augmented postinduction therapy was shown to improve outcome for standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with high end-induction MRD.[[51](#cit/section_7.51)]
- MRD levels earlier in induction (e.g., days 8 and 15) and at later postinduction time points (e.g., week 12 after starting therapy) have also been shown to have prognostic significance in both B-ALL and T-ALL.[[45](#cit/section_7.45),[46](#cit/section_7.46),[49](#cit/section_7.49),[52](#cit/section_7.52)-[55](#cit/section_7.55)]
- Nearly all patients with a positive end-of-induction MRD will become MRD negative at the end of 4 to 8 weeks of consolidation therapy. In a COG study, patients with high-risk B-ALL who had a positive end-of-induction MRD but a negative end-of-consolidation MRD had a significantly improved DFS compared with patients who were MRD positive at end of consolidation (5-year DFS rate, 79.5% vs. 39.5%).[[46](#cit/section_7.46)]

For more information, see the [Response to initial treatment](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_526) section.

For specific information about CNS therapy to prevent CNS relapse in children with newly diagnosed ALL, see the [CNS-Directed Therapy for Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_576) section.

### Standard Postinduction Treatment Options for Childhood ALL

Standard treatment options for consolidation/intensification and maintenance therapy (postinduction therapy) include the following:

1. Chemotherapy.

CNS-directed therapy is provided during premaintenance chemotherapy by all groups. Some protocols (COG, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital [SJCRH], and DFCI) provide ongoing intrathecal chemotherapy during maintenance, while others (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster [BFM]) do not. For specific information about CNS therapy to prevent CNS relapse in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are receiving postinduction therapy, see the [CNS-Directed Therapy for Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_576) section.

#### Consolidation/intensification therapy

Once CR has been achieved, systemic treatment in conjunction with
CNS-directed therapy follows. The intensity of the
postinduction chemotherapy varies considerably depending on risk group assignment, but all patients receive some
form of intensification after the achievement of CR and before
beginning maintenance therapy.

The most commonly used intensification schema is the BFM backbone. This therapeutic backbone, first introduced by the BFM clinical trials group, includes the following:[[1](#cit/section_7.1)]

1. An initial consolidation (referred to as induction IB) immediately after the initial induction phase. This phase includes intrathecal therapy, cyclophosphamide, low-dose cytarabine, and mercaptopurine.

An interim maintenance phase, which includes intrathecal therapy and four doses of high-dose methotrexate (typically 5 g/m2) with leucovorin rescue.
2. Reinduction (or delayed intensification), which typically includes agents and schedules similar to those used during the induction and initial consolidation phases.
3. Maintenance, typically consisting of daily mercaptopurine (6-MP), weekly low-dose methotrexate, and sometimes, intermittent administration of vincristine and a corticosteroid, as well as continued intrathecal therapy.

This backbone has been adopted by many groups, including the COG. Variation of this backbone includes the following:

- Intensification for higher-risk patients by including additional doses of vincristine and pegaspargase, as well as repeated interim maintenance and delayed intensification phases.[[56](#cit/section_7.56),[57](#cit/section_7.57)]
- The use of escalating doses of methotrexate (starting at a dose of 100 mg/m2) without leucovorin rescue instead of or in addition to high-dose methotrexate during interim maintenance phases.
- Elimination or truncation of some of the phases for lower-risk patients to minimize acute and long-term toxicity.

Other clinical trial groups utilize a different therapeutic backbone during postinduction treatment phases, as follows:

- DFCI: The DFCI ALL Consortium protocols include 30 weeks of pegaspargase therapy beginning at week 7 of therapy, given in conjunction with maintenance regimen (vincristine/dexamethasone pulses, weekly low-dose methotrexate, daily mercaptopurine).[[3](#cit/section_7.3)] These protocols also do not include a delayed intensification phase, but high-risk patients receive additional doses of doxorubicin (instead of low-dose methotrexate) during the first six months of postinduction therapy.
- NOPHO: The NOPHO also emphasizes the use of pegaspargase during consolidation and intensification. In the ALL2008 trial, all patients received five doses of pegaspargase given every other week after induction. Patients then received an additional ten doses at 2-week intervals or three doses at 6-week intervals. Both regimens produced equally excellent survival rates, with reduced toxicity in the three-dose regimen.[[58](#cit/section_7.58)]
- SJCRH: SJCRH follows a BFM backbone but augments the reinduction and maintenance phases for some patients by including intensified dosing of pegaspargase, frequent vincristine/corticosteroid pulses, and rotating drug pairs during maintenance (mercaptopurine/methotrexate, cyclophosphamide/cytarabine, dexamethasone/vincristine).[[59](#cit/section_7.59)]

##### Standard-risk ALL

In children with low- and standard-risk B-ALL, there has been an attempt to limit
exposure to drugs such as anthracyclines and alkylating agents that may be
associated with an increased risk of late toxic effects.[[60](#cit/section_7.60)-[62](#cit/section_7.62)] The COG regimen for standard-risk B-ALL postinduction therapy can be delivered in the outpatient setting and has multiple favorable characteristics, including low-intensity 4-week consolidation, limited anthracycline (75 mg/m2) and alkylator exposure (1 gm/m2), only two doses of pegaspargase, and interim maintenance phases consisting of escalating doses of methotrexate (without leucovorin rescue) rather than high-dose IV methotrexate.[[63](#cit/section_7.63)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Favorable outcomes for standard-risk patients with B-ALL were also reported in trials that used a limited number of courses of intermediate-dose or high-dose
methotrexate as consolidation followed by maintenance therapy (without a reinduction phase).[[61](#cit/section_7.61),[64](#cit/section_7.64),[65](#cit/section_7.65)] More specifically, a subset of patients with standard-risk B-ALL with favorable cytogenetics, no evidence of CNS or testicular disease at diagnosis, and rapid achievement of low levels of MRD, have been treated with exposure to no or low doses of anthracyclines and alkylating agents. The 5-year DFS rate was almost 99%, and the OS rate was 100%.[[66](#cit/section_7.66)] The DFCI ALL Consortium study used multiple doses of pegaspargase (30 weeks) as consolidation, without postinduction exposure to alkylating agents or anthracyclines.[[67](#cit/section_7.67),[68](#cit/section_7.68)]

However, the prognostic impact of end-induction and/or consolidation MRD has influenced the treatment of patients originally diagnosed as NCI standard risk. Multiple studies have demonstrated that higher levels of end-induction MRD are associated with poorer prognosis.[[45](#cit/section_7.45),[47](#cit/section_7.47),[48](#cit/section_7.48),[69](#cit/section_7.69),[70](#cit/section_7.70)] Augmenting therapy has been shown to improve the outcome in standard-risk patients with elevated MRD levels at the end of induction.[[51](#cit/section_7.51)] Patients with NCI standard-risk B-ALL with high-risk features (including increased end-of-induction MRD levels as well as CNS2 status at diagnosis, and/or unfavorable genetics) are treated with more intensified therapy. For more information, see the [Prognostic (risk) groups under clinical evaluation](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_543) section.

Evidence (intensification for standard-risk B-ALL):

1. Clinical trials conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s demonstrated that the use of
a delayed intensification phase improved outcome for children with standard-risk ALL treated with regimens using a BFM backbone.[[71](#cit/section_7.71)-[73](#cit/section_7.73)] The delayed intensification phase on such regimens, including those of the COG, consists of an 8-week phase of reinduction (including dexamethasone and an anthracycline) and reconsolidation containing cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine given approximately 4 to 6 months after remission is achieved.[[35](#cit/section_7.35),[71](#cit/section_7.71),[74](#cit/section_7.74)]
2. The former Children's Cancer Group (CCG) study (CCG-1991/[COG-1991](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005945)) for standard-risk ALL used dexamethasone in a three-drug induction phase and tested the utility of a second delayed intensification phase. This study also compared escalating IV methotrexate (without leucovorin rescue) in conjunction with vincristine versus a standard maintenance combination with oral methotrexate given during two interim maintenance phases.[[75](#cit/section_7.75)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- A second delayed intensification phase provided no benefit in patients who were rapid early responders (M1 or M2 marrow by day 14 of induction).
- Escalating IV methotrexate during the interim maintenance phases, compared with oral methotrexate during these phases, produced a significant improvement in EFS, which was because of a decreased incidence of isolated extramedullary relapses, particularly those involving the CNS.
- Successful therapies for patients with standard-risk ALL that have decreased the use of drugs associated with long-term toxicities have focused on children with B-ALL, not T-ALL.[[61](#cit/section_7.61),[62](#cit/section_7.62),[64](#cit/section_7.64),[65](#cit/section_7.65),[67](#cit/section_7.67),[68](#cit/section_7.68)] The COG, Dutch Children's Oncology Group (DCOG), DFCI, NOPHO, and other large cooperative groups have excluded patients with T-cell ALL from low and standard-risk therapies. Patients with NCI standard-risk features but a T-cell immunophenotype had an inferior EFS and OS compared with patients with NCI standard-risk B-ALL treated on the same regimens on CCG1952 and CCG1991.[[76](#cit/section_7.76)]
3. The COG [AALL0331 (NCT00103285)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00103285) study stratified intensity of therapy for NCI standard-risk patients on the basis of biology and early response. Rapid early response was defined as less than 5% bone marrow blasts by day 15 based on local morphological interpretation and an M1 bone marrow with MRD levels of less than 0.1% at day 29. Standard-risk low patients were those with favorable biology (*ETV6*::*RUNX1* or high hyperdiploidy with triple trisomy), CNS1 status, and a rapid early response. Standard-risk average patients were those lacking favorable or unfavorable biology who also had a rapid early response. Standard-risk high patients were those with slow early response and/or CNS3 status, or *KMT2A*-rearranged patients with rapid early response. All patients received a three-drug prednisone-based induction (no anthracycline). Standard-risk average patients were randomly assigned to either intensified consolidation (augmented BFM) or standard consolidation. Standard-risk high patients were nonrandomly assigned to the full augmented BFM therapy used for NCI high-risk patients, including two delayed intensification phases.[[77](#cit/section_7.77)]

- The 6-year EFS rate for all patients was 89%, and the OS rate was 96%.
- For standard-risk low patients, this study evaluated the addition of four doses of pegaspargase (added in consolidation and interim maintenance phases) to standard therapy, which included two doses of pegaspargase (administered in induction and delayed intensification phases). Standard-risk low patients had highly favorable outcomes (6-year DFS and OS rates were 94.7% ± 0.6% and 98.7% ± 0.3%, respectively). The augmentation of standard-risk low therapy with additional pegaspargase did not improve outcomes.[[63](#cit/section_7.63)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- For standard-risk average patients, the augmented consolidation regimen did not improve rates of continuous complete remission (CCR) or OS. The 6-year rates of CCR and OS for the standard-risk average cohort were 88% to 89% and 95% to 96%, respectively.
- Standard-risk average patients with end-induction MRD levels of 0.01% to <0.1% had an inferior outcome compared with those with MRD levels of <0.01% (6-year CCR rates, 77% vs. 91%, respectively). Augmented consolidation was not associated with a better outcome in standard-risk average patients with higher levels of MRD.
- The standard-risk high cohort achieved a relatively favorable 6-year CCR rate of 86% and an OS rate of 93%.
4. In a randomized study conducted in the United Kingdom, children and young adults with ALL who lacked high-risk features (including adverse cytogenetics, and/or M3 marrow morphology at day 8 or day 15 of induction) were risk-stratified on the basis of MRD level at the end of induction (week 4) and at week 11 of therapy. Patients with undetectable MRD at week 4 (or with low MRD at week 4 and undetectable by week 11) were considered low risk, and were eligible to be randomly assigned to therapy with either one or two delayed intensification phases.[[78](#cit/section_7.78)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- There was no significant difference in EFS between patients who received one and those who received two delayed intensification phases.
- There was no significant difference in treatment-related deaths between the two arms; however, the second delayed intensification phase was associated with grade 3 or 4 toxic events in 17% of the 261 patients randomly assigned to that arm, and one patient experienced a treatment-related death during that phase.
5. In the AIEOP [ALL-BFM-2000 (NCT00430118)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00430118) trial, standard-risk patients (defined as those with undetectable MRD at days 33 and 78 and absence of high-risk cytogenetics) were randomly assigned to receive treatment with a single delayed-intensification phase of either standard intensity or reduced intensity (shorter duration, with reduced total dosages of dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide).[[79](#cit/section_7.79)]

- Reduced-intensity delayed intensification was associated with an inferior 8-year DFS rate (89% vs. 92%, *P* = .04), resulting from an increased risk of relapse.
- In a subset analysis, for patients with the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion, no difference in outcome between the two treatment arms was observed (8-year DFS rate, approximately 94% for both arms).
6. The Malaysia-Singapore ALL MS2010 trial for patients with favorable-risk B-ALL evaluated a deintensified, modified BFM regimen. This regimen omitted anthracyclines, had fewer doses of high-dose methotrexate, and fewer doses of low-dose cytarabine.[[80](#cit/section_7.80)]

- The long-term EFS in this trial (6-year EFS rate, 96.5%) was noninferior, compared with the predecessor trial conducted by the same group.
- This regimen was also less toxic, with significantly decreased rates of bacteremia and septic shock/intensive care unit admissions.
7. Patients who are standard or intermediate risk at diagnosis, but have high levels of end-induction MRD, have been shown to have a poorer prognosis and should be treated as high-risk patients. The [UKALL2003 (NCT00222612)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00222612) trial used augmented postinduction therapy (extra doses of pegaspargase and vincristine and an escalated-dose of IV methotrexate without leucovorin rescue) to treat standard- or intermediate-risk patients with high levels of end-induction MRD.[[51](#cit/section_7.51)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Augmented postinduction therapy resulted in an increased EFS that was comparable to that of patients with low levels of end-induction MRD.

##### High-risk ALL

In high-risk patients, a number of different approaches have been used with
comparable efficacy.[[67](#cit/section_7.67),[81](#cit/section_7.81)]; [[74](#cit/section_7.74)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Treatment for high-risk patients
is generally more intensive than that for standard-risk patients and typically includes higher cumulative doses of multiple agents, including anthracyclines and/or alkylating agents. Higher doses of these agents increase the risk of both short-term and long-term toxicities, and many clinical trials have focused on reducing the side effects of these intensified regimens.

Evidence (intensification for high-risk ALL):

1. The former CCG developed an augmented BFM treatment regimen that included a second interim maintenance and delayed intensification phase. This regimen featured repeated courses of escalating-dose IV methotrexate (without leucovorin rescue) given with vincristine and pegaspargase during interim maintenance and additional vincristine and pegaspargase pulses during initial consolidation and delayed intensification. In the CCG-1882 trial, NCI high-risk patients with slow early response (M3 marrow on day 7 of induction) were randomly assigned to receive either standard- or augmented-BFM therapy.[[56](#cit/section_7.56)]

- The augmented-therapy regimen in the CCG-1882 trial produced significantly better EFS and OS rates (75% and 78%) than did the standard CCG modified-BFM therapy (55% and 66.7%).
- There was a significantly higher incidence of osteonecrosis in patients older than 10 years who received the augmented therapy (which included two 21-day postinduction dexamethasone courses), compared with those who were treated on the standard arm (one 21-day postinduction dexamethasone course).[[82](#cit/section_7.82)]
2. In an Italian study, investigators showed that two applications of delayed intensification therapy (protocol II) significantly improved outcome for patients with a poor response to a prednisone prophase.[[83](#cit/section_7.83)]
3. The [CCG-1961](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002812) study used a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare both standard- versus augmented-intensity therapies and therapies of standard duration (one interim maintenance and delayed intensification phase) versus increased duration (two interim maintenance and delayed intensification phases) among NCI high-risk patients with a rapid early response. This trial also tested whether continuous versus alternate-week dexamethasone during delayed intensification phases affected rates of osteonecrosis.

- Augmented therapy was associated with an improvement in EFS. There was no EFS benefit associated with the administration of the second interim maintenance and delayed intensification phases.[[57](#cit/section_7.57),[84](#cit/section_7.84)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- The cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis at 5 years was 9.9% for patients aged 10 to 15 years and 20.0% for patients aged 16 to 21 years, compared with 1.0% for patients aged 1 to 9 years (*P* = .0001). For patients aged 10 to 21 years, alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone during delayed intensification phases was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis, compared with continuous dosing (8.7% vs. 17.0%, *P* = .0005).[[85](#cit/section_7.85)][[Level of evidence A3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810021&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
4. In the [UKALL2003 (NCT00222612)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00222612) trial, patients with high end-induction MRD (>0.01%) and/or high-risk cytogenetics were randomly assigned to receive either a standard-intensity or an augmented BFM chemotherapy backbone.[[86](#cit/section_7.86)]

- The 10-year EFS rate was 87.1% for patients assigned to the augmented chemotherapy backbone, compared with 82.1% for those assigned the standard-intensity chemotherapy backbone (*P* = .09).
- Patients with high-risk cytogenetics had a significantly lower risk of relapse when treated with augmented therapy (10-year relapse rate, 22.1% vs. 52.4% with standard-intensity therapy; *P* = .016).
5. In the COG [AALL0232 (NCT00075725)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00075725) study (2004–2011), patients with high-risk B-ALL received an augmented BFM backbone with one interim maintenance and delayed intensification phase. Only patients with end-induction MRD greater than 0.1% or M2/M3 marrow at day 15 received two interim maintenance/delayed intensification phases. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose methotrexate or escalating dose IV methotrexate (Capizzi methotrexate) plus pegaspargase during the interim maintenance phase (the first phase only for those receiving two of these phases).[[8](#cit/section_7.8),[46](#cit/section_7.46)]

- The methotrexate randomization was terminated early when planned interim monitoring indicated that high-dose methotrexate was associated with superior outcome. The 5-year EFS rate of patients randomly assigned to high-dose methotrexate was 79.6%, compared with 75% for those randomly assigned to the Capizzi methotrexate arm. High-dose methotrexate was also associated with a superior 5-year OS (*P* = .025).[[8](#cit/section_7.8)]
- Patients with MRD less than 0.01% at end of induction had a 5-year EFS rate of 87%, compared with 74% for those with MRD 0.01% to 0.1%. Those with MRD levels greater than 0.1% fared worse.[[46](#cit/section_7.46)]
- High-dose methotrexate was associated with a superior EFS rate in patients with end-induction MRD greater than 0.01% (high-dose methotrexate, 68%; Capizzi methotrexate, 58%; *P* = .008).[[46](#cit/section_7.46)]

Because treatment for high-risk ALL involves more intensive therapy, leading to a higher risk of acute and long-term toxicities, a number of clinical trials have tested interventions to prevent side effects without adversely impacting EFS. Interventions that have been investigated include the use of the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane to prevent anthracycline-related cardiac toxic effects and alternative scheduling of corticosteroids to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis.

Evidence (cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane):

1. In a DFCI ALL Consortium trial, children with high-risk ALL were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin alone (30 mg/m2/dose to a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2) or with dexrazoxane during the induction and intensification phases of multiagent chemotherapy.[[87](#cit/section_7.87),[88](#cit/section_7.88)]

- The use of the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane before doxorubicin resulted in better left ventricular fractional shortening and improved end-systolic dimension Z-scores without any adverse effect on EFS or increase in
second malignancy risk, compared with the use of doxorubicin alone 5 years posttreatment.
- A greater long-term protective effect was noted in girls than in boys.
2. On the [POG-9404](/clinicaltrials/NCT01230983) trial, patients with T-ALL were randomly assigned to receive dexrazoxane or not before each dose of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 360 mg/m2).[[89](#cit/section_7.89)]

- There was no difference in EFS between patients with T-ALL who were treated with dexrazoxane and patients who were not treated with dexrazoxane (cumulative doxorubicin dose, 360 mg/m2).
- Three years after initial diagnosis, left ventricular shortening fraction and left ventricular wall thickness were both significantly worse in patients who received doxorubicin alone than in patients who received dexrazoxane, indicating that dexrazoxane was cardioprotective. The frequency of grade 3 and 4 toxicities that occurred during therapy was similar between the randomized groups, and there was no difference in cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasms.

Evidence (reducing risk of osteonecrosis):

1. In the CCG-1961 study, alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone during delayed intensification was studied with the goal of reducing the frequency of osteonecrosis.[[85](#cit/section_7.85)] Patients with high-risk B-ALL and a rapid early morphological response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive either one or two delayed intensification phases. Patients randomly assigned to one delayed intensification phase received daily dosing of dexamethasone (21 consecutive days), while those randomly assigned to two delayed intensification phases received alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone (days 0–6 and 14–21) during each delayed intensification phase.

- For patients aged 10 years or older at diagnosis, those who received two delayed intensification phases (alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone) had a significantly lower risk of symptomatic osteonecrosis (5-year cumulative incidence of 8.7%, compared with 17% for patients receiving one delayed intensification phase with continuous dexamethasone dosing; *P* = .001).
- The greatest impact was seen in females aged 16 to 21 years, who showed the highest incidence of osteonecrosis with standard therapy containing continuous dexamethasone; the incidence of osteonecrosis with alternative-week dexamethasone was 5.6%, compared with 57.6% for those receiving continuous dosing.

For more information, see the [Osteonecrosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1576) section.

##### Very high-risk ALL

Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with ALL are classified as very high risk, including the following:[[74](#cit/section_7.74),[90](#cit/section_7.90)]

- Infants younger than 1 year, especially if there is a *KMT2A* gene rearrangement present. For more information about infants with
ALL, see the [Infants With ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1152) section.
- Patients with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, including *BCR*::*ABL1*, *TCF3*::*HLF*, *KMT2A* gene rearrangements, and low hypodiploidy (<44 chromosomes).
- Patients who achieve CR but have a slow early response to initial therapy, including those with a high absolute blast count after a 7-day steroid prophase, and patients with high MRD levels at the end of induction (week 4) or later time points (e.g., week 12).
- Patients who have morphologically persistent disease after the first 4 weeks of therapy (induction failure), even if they later achieve CR.

Patients with very high-risk features have been treated with multiple cycles of intensive chemotherapy during the consolidation phase (usually in addition to the typical BFM backbone intensification phases). These additional cycles often include agents not typically used in frontline ALL regimens for standard-risk and high-risk patients, such as high-dose cytarabine, ifosfamide, and etoposide.[[74](#cit/section_7.74)] However, even with this intensified approach, reported long-term EFS rates range from 30% to 50% for some of these very high-risk subsets.[[39](#cit/section_7.39),[74](#cit/section_7.74)] The DCOG reported the outcomes of 107 patients with very high-risk features who were treated with three to six intensive chemotherapy blocks in two consecutive trials. Sixty of these patients received an allogeneic HSCT in first CR. The 5-year EFS rate was 73%, and the OS rate was 79% for all patients. With this intensified treatment approach, the cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality was 12.3%, which was similar to the cumulative incidence of relapse, at 13%.[[91](#cit/section_7.91)]

On some clinical trials, very high-risk patients have also been considered candidates for allogeneic HSCT in first CR.[[39](#cit/section_7.39),[92](#cit/section_7.92)-[94](#cit/section_7.94)] However, there are limited data regarding the outcome of very high-risk patients treated with allogeneic HSCT in first CR. Controversy exists regarding which subpopulations could potentially benefit from HSCT.

Evidence (allogeneic HSCT in first remission for very high-risk patients):

1. In a European cooperative group study conducted between 1995 and 2000, very high-risk patients were defined as one of the following: morphologically persistent disease after a four-drug induction, *BCR*::*ABL1* or *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusions, or poor response to prednisone prophase in patients with either T-cell phenotype or presenting white blood cells (WBC) >100,000/μL. These patients were assigned to receive either an allogeneic HSCT in first CR (based on the availability of a human lymphocyte antigen–matched related donor) or intensive chemotherapy.[[39](#cit/section_7.39)]

- Using an intent-to-treat analysis, patients assigned to allogeneic HSCT (on the basis of donor availability) had a superior 5-year DFS rate compared with patients assigned to intensive chemotherapy (57% ± 7% for transplant vs. 41% ± 3% for chemotherapy, *P* = .02).
- There was no significant difference in OS rates (56% ± 6% for transplant vs. 50% ± 3% for chemotherapy; *P* = .12).
- For patients with T-ALL and a poor response to prednisone prophase, both DFS and OS rates were significantly better with allogeneic HSCT.[[92](#cit/section_7.92)]
2. In a large retrospective series of patients with initial induction failure, the 10-year OS rate for patients with persistent leukemia was 32%.[[41](#cit/section_7.41)]

- A trend for superior outcome with allogeneic HSCT, compared with chemotherapy alone, was observed in patients with T-cell phenotype (any age) and with B-ALL who were older than 6 years.
- Patients with B-ALL who were aged 1 to 5 years at diagnosis and did not have any adverse cytogenetic abnormalities (*KMT2A* rearrangement, *BCR*::*ABL1*) had a relatively favorable prognosis, without any advantage in outcome with the utilization of HSCT compared with chemotherapy alone.
3. The AIEOP [ALL-BFM-2000 (NCT00430118)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00430118) study (2000–2006) classified patients as high risk if they met any of the following criteria: poor response to prednisone prophase, failure to achieve CR at the end of the first month of treatment, high MRD levels after induction IB (day 78 of therapy), and *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusion. These patients were allocated to allogeneic HSCT in first CR per protocol on the basis of donor availability and investigator preference.[[95](#cit/section_7.95)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The overall 5-year EFS rate of patients meeting high-risk criteria was 58.9%.
- The 5-year EFS rate was 74% for patients whose only high-risk feature was prednisone-poor response. There was no significant difference in DFS (*P* = .31) or OS (*P* = .91) when comparing HSCT and chemotherapy for patients with poor prednisone response in whom HSCT was allowed per protocol (those with T-ALL and/or WBC ≥100,000/mm3).
- All other high-risk patients (i.e., those with initial induction failure, high day 78 MRD and/or *KMT2A*::*AFF1* fusion) had EFS rates less than 50%. For these patients, there was no statistically significant difference in DFS between those who received HSCT (n = 66) and those who received chemotherapy only (n = 88), after adjusting for waiting time to HSCT (5.7 months).
4. On the NOPHO [ALL2008 (NCT00819351)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00819351) protocol, patients were allocated to HSCT in first CR if they had MRD levels of 5% or greater at the end of induction or MRD levels of 0.1% or greater at end of consolidation. All patients allocated to HSCT received at least three blocks of intensive chemotherapy before HSCT to reduce levels of MRD.[[96](#cit/section_7.96)]

- In the intent-to-treat analysis of 69 patients who met HSCT criteria (10 of whom did not undergo HSCT), the 5-year DFS rate was 78%.
- Comparing the patients in this cohort who did and did not receive HSCT, receipt of HSCT was not significantly associated with survival (HR, 1.4; *P* = .69).
- For patients who underwent HSCT, superior outcomes (better DFS and lower cumulative incidence of relapse) were observed in patients who had nondetectable MRD before HSCT.
5. In the DCOG ALL-10 and ALL-11 trials, patients with very high-risk features received an intensified treatment regimen that included three high-dose chemotherapy blocks after consolidation. After the three blocks, 60 patients received an allogeneic HSCT, and 22 patients continued with a chemotherapy-only approach, which included three additional high-dose blocks. In these trials, very high-risk disease was defined by any of the following features: morphologically detectable disease at end of induction, high end-consolidation MRD (time point 2), t(4;11), or poor response to a prednisone prophase.[[91](#cit/section_7.91)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 72.8% for all patients.
- In a landmark analysis of EFS from the end of the third high-dose chemotherapy block, no difference was observed in the outcomes of patients who received HSCT versus those who received chemotherapy only.
6. Two retrospective analyses investigated the role of HSCT in first CR for patients with hypodiploid ALL. The studies showed no clear evidence that HSCT improved outcomes when 1) transplanting all patients with hypodiploid ALL, or 2) transplanting hypodiploid patients deemed at high risk on the basis of high MRD after induction. The studies did not examine the strategy of HSCT for persistent MRD after consolidation, nor did they analyze the status of MRD at the time of HSCT.

1. In a study of 306 hypodiploid patients from 16 ALL cooperative groups treated between 1997 and 2013, a subgroup of 228 patients (42 who underwent HSCT) with 44 or fewer chromosomes who achieved remission were analyzed.[[97](#cit/section_7.97)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Favorable prognostic factors included a chromosome number of 44 (compared with 43 or fewer), MRD less than 0.01% after induction, and treatment on an MRD-stratified protocol that intensified therapy for patients with higher MRD after induction.
- After correction for median time to transplant, patients with low MRD who underwent HSCT had a DFS rate of 73.6%, compared with a DFS rate of 70% for those treated with chemotherapy alone (*P* = .81). Patients with higher MRD after induction who underwent HSCT had a DFS rate of 55.9%, compared with a DFS rate of 40.3% for those treated with chemotherapy (*P* = .29).
2. The COG published an analysis of 113 evaluable patients with hypodiploid ALL who were treated between 2003 and 2011; 61 of those patients underwent HSCT in first CR.[[98](#cit/section_7.98)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 57.4% for patients who underwent HSCT and 47.8% for patients in the chemotherapy cohorts (*P* = .49). The OS rate was 66.2% for patients who underwent HSCT and 53.8% for patients in the chemotherapy cohorts (*P* = .34).
- Patients with high MRD after induction (≥0.01%) had a very poor EFS rate of 26.7% at 5 years, with no difference between the patients who received HSCT and the patients who received chemotherapy.

#### Maintenance therapy

##### Backbone of maintenance therapy

The backbone of maintenance therapy in most protocols includes daily oral
mercaptopurine and weekly oral or parenteral methotrexate. On many protocols, intrathecal chemotherapy for CNS sanctuary therapy is
continued during maintenance therapy. Also, vincristine/steroid pulses during maintenance are used by some groups but not others (see [below](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1099)). It is imperative to
carefully monitor children on maintenance therapy for both drug-related
toxicity and for compliance with the oral chemotherapy agents used during
maintenance therapy.[[99](#cit/section_7.99)] A protocol conducted by the COG suggested there are significant differences in compliance with oral mercaptopurine regimens among various racial and socioeconomic groups and that level of adherence impacts relapse risk.[[99](#cit/section_7.99),[100](#cit/section_7.100)]

In the past, clinical practice generally called for the administration of oral mercaptopurine in the evening, on the basis of evidence from older studies that this practice may improve EFS.[[101](#cit/section_7.101)] However, in a study conducted by the NOPHO group, in which details of oral intake were prospectively captured, timing of mercaptopurine administration (nighttime vs. other times of day) was not of prognostic significance.[[102](#cit/section_7.102)] In a COG study, taking mercaptopurine at varying times of day rather than consistently at nighttime was associated with higher rates of nonadherence. However, among adherent patients (i.e., those who took >95% of prescribed doses), there was no association between timing of mercaptopurine ingestion and relapse risk.[[103](#cit/section_7.103)]

Some patients may develop severe hematologic toxicity when
receiving conventional dosages of mercaptopurine because of an inherited
deficiency (homozygous mutant) of thiopurine S-methyltransferase, an enzyme that inactivates
mercaptopurine.[[104](#cit/section_7.104),[105](#cit/section_7.105)] These patients are able to tolerate mercaptopurine only
in much lower dosages than those conventionally used.[[104](#cit/section_7.104),[105](#cit/section_7.105)]
Patients who are heterozygous for the variant generally tolerate
mercaptopurine without serious toxicity, but they do require more frequent dose
reductions for hematologic toxicity than do patients who are homozygous for the
normal allele.[[104](#cit/section_7.104)] Polymorphisms of the *NUDT15* gene, observed most frequently in East Asian and Hispanic patients, have also been linked to extreme sensitivity to the myelosuppressive effects of mercaptopurine.[[106](#cit/section_7.106)-[108](#cit/section_7.108)]

Evidence (maintenance therapy):

1. A meta-analysis of randomized trials compared thiopurines and found the following:

- Thioguanine did not improve the overall EFS, although particular subgroups may benefit from its use.[[109](#cit/section_7.109)]
- The use of continuous thioguanine instead of mercaptopurine during the maintenance phase is associated with an increased risk of hepatic complications, including veno-occlusive disease (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) and portal hypertension.[[110](#cit/section_7.110)-[114](#cit/section_7.114)]
- Because of the increased toxicity of thioguanine, mercaptopurine remains the standard drug of choice.
2. In the COG [AALL0932 (NCT01190930)](/clinicaltrials/NCT01190930) trial, NCI standard-risk patients with average-risk features were randomly assigned to receive weekly oral methotrexate during maintenance at one of two starting doses: 20 mg/m2 (standard) or 40 mg/m2 (investigational).[[115](#cit/section_7.115)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- There was no significant difference in 5-year DFS from the start of maintenance therapy between the two treatment arms (5-year DFS rate, 95.1% for patients who received the standard dose vs. 94.2% for patients who received the investigational dose; *P* = .92), indicating no advantage for the higher dose of oral methotrexate.
3. An intensified maintenance regimen, consisting of rotating pairs of agents, including cyclophosphamide and epipodophyllotoxins along with more standard maintenance agents, has been evaluated in several clinical trials conducted by SJCRH and other groups.[[2](#cit/section_7.2)]

- The intensified maintenance with rotating pairs of agents was associated with more episodes of febrile neutropenia [[116](#cit/section_7.116)] and a higher risk of secondary acute myelogenous leukemia,[[117](#cit/section_7.117),[118](#cit/section_7.118)] especially when epipodophyllotoxins were included.[[116](#cit/section_7.116)]

On the basis of these findings, SJCRH modified the agents used in the rotating pair schedule during the maintenance phase. On the [Total XV](/clinicaltrials/NCT00137111) study, standard-risk and high-risk patients received three rotating pairs (mercaptopurine plus methotrexate, cyclophosphamide plus cytarabine, and dexamethasone plus vincristine) throughout this treatment phase. Low-risk patients received more standard maintenance (without cyclophosphamide and cytarabine).[[59](#cit/section_7.59)]
- A randomized study from Argentina demonstrated no benefit from this intensified approach compared with a more standard maintenance regimen for patients who receive induction and consolidation phases based on a BFM backbone.[[116](#cit/section_7.116)]

##### Vincristine/corticosteroid pulses

Pulses of vincristine and corticosteroid are often added to the
standard maintenance backbone, although the benefit of these pulses within the context of contemporary multiagent chemotherapy regimens remains controversial.

Evidence (vincristine/corticosteroid pulses):

1. A CCG randomized trial conducted in the 1980s demonstrated improved
outcome in patients who received monthly vincristine/prednisone pulses.[[119](#cit/section_7.119)]
2. A
meta-analysis combining data from six clinical trials from the same treatment era showed an EFS advantage for vincristine/prednisone pulses.[[120](#cit/section_7.120),[121](#cit/section_7.121)] However, overall EFS from these trials was lower than is observed with more contemporary regimens.
3. A systematic review of the impact of vincristine plus steroid pulses from more recent clinical trials raised the question of whether such pulses are of value in current ALL treatment, which includes more intensive early therapy and risk stratification incorporating early response (MRD) and biological factors.[[121](#cit/section_7.121)]
4. In a multicenter randomized trial in children with intermediate-risk ALL being treated on a BFM regimen, there was no benefit associated with the addition of six pulses of vincristine/dexamethasone during the continuation phase, although the pulses were administered less frequently than in other trials in which a benefit had been demonstrated.[[122](#cit/section_7.122)]
5. A small multicenter trial of average-risk patients demonstrated superior EFS in patients receiving vincristine plus corticosteroid pulses. In this study, there was no difference in outcome based on type of steroid (prednisone vs. dexamethasone).[[123](#cit/section_7.123)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
6. In the COG [AALL0932 (NCT01190930)](/clinicaltrials/NCT01190930) trial, standard-risk patients were randomly assigned during maintenance to receive vincristine/dexamethasone pulses every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks.[[115](#cit/section_7.115)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- For the randomly assigned standard-risk patients, the 5-year DFS rate from the start of maintenance was 94.6%. There was no significant difference between the every-4-week group and the every-12-week group.
7. The Chinese Children’s Cancer Group conducted a randomized noninferiority trial to determine whether vincristine/dexamethasone pulses could be omitted during the second year of maintenance therapy. One year after the initiation of therapy, 5,054 patients with non-*BCR*::*ABL1* fusion–positive ALL (B-ALL and T-ALL, aged 0–18 years) were randomly assigned to receive either vincristine/dexamethasone pulses every 8 weeks (seven pulses total) or no pulses during the second year of maintenance chemotherapy. Noninferiority was defined by calculating the one-sided 95% upper confidence bound of the difference in EFS probability between arms to ensure that an EFS decrement of 5% or more was ruled out.[[124](#cit/section_7.124)]

- For low-risk patients (NCI standard-risk B-ALL with high hyperdiploidy or *ETV6*::*RUNX1* and low end-induction MRD), the EFS difference between arms met the protocol definition of noninferiority, indicating that omission of vincristine/dexamethasone pulses during the second year of maintenance did not result in a decrement of EFS that was greater than 5%.
- For intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, the difference in 5-year EFS between arms did not meet the protocol definition of noninferiority (the 95% upper confidence bound for the difference was 0.055, which exceeded the preset noninferiority margin of 0.05); therefore, it could not be concluded that vincristine/dexamethasone pulses could be omitted in these patients without resulting in an EFS decrement exceeding 5%.
8. The Japanese Childhood Cancer Group ALL-B12 trial included 1,107 patients with standard-risk B-ALL (i.e., NCI standard risk, good response to prednisone, day 15 marrow M1/2, end-of-induction marrow M1 without high-risk features [CNS3, *KMT2A* rearranged, *TCF3*::*HLF* fusion, *TCF4*::*HLF* fusion, hypodiploid]). Patients were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy, either with or without every 4-week vincristine/dexamethasone pulses.[[125](#cit/section_7.125)]

- There was no difference in EFS or adverse events between the two treatment groups.
9. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of reducing vincristine/steroid pulses on EFS, OS, and toxicity in patients with B-ALL. Twenty-five publications that included more than 12,000 patients were examined.[[126](#cit/section_7.126)]

- This study demonstrated that the benefit of these pulses noted in historical trials was not seen in contemporary trials.
- However, there was an increased risk of grade 3+ nonhepatic toxicity in the high-pulse frequency group.
- The authors concluded that decreasing or removing pulses likely does not affect survival or risk of relapse, but it is associated with reduced toxicity.

For regimens that include vincristine/steroid pulses, a number of studies have addressed which steroid (dexamethasone or prednisone) should be used. From these studies, it appears that dexamethasone is associated with superior EFS, but also may lead to a greater frequency of steroid-associated complications, including bone toxicity and infections, especially in older children and adolescents.[[6](#cit/section_7.6),[7](#cit/section_7.7),[24](#cit/section_7.24),[71](#cit/section_7.71),[127](#cit/section_7.127)] Compared with prednisone, dexamethasone has also been associated with a higher frequency of behavioral problems.[[7](#cit/section_7.7)] In a randomized study of 50 patients aged 3 to 16 years who received maintenance chemotherapy, concurrent administration of hydrocortisone (at physiological dosing) during dexamethasone pulses reduced the frequency of behavioral difficulties, emotional lability, and sleep disturbances.[[128](#cit/section_7.128)]

Evidence (dexamethasone vs. prednisone):

1. In a
CCG study, dexamethasone was compared with prednisone during the induction and maintenance phases for children aged 1 to
younger than 10 years with lower-risk ALL.[[6](#cit/section_7.6),[71](#cit/section_7.71)]

- Patients randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone had significantly fewer CNS relapses and a significantly better EFS rate.
2. In a MRC United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (UKALL) trial, dexamethasone was compared with prednisolone during the induction and maintenance phases in both standard-risk and high-risk patients.[[7](#cit/section_7.7)]

- The EFS and incidence of both CNS and non-CNS relapses improved with the use of dexamethasone.
- Dexamethasone was associated with an increased risk of steroid-associated toxicities, including behavioral problems, myopathy, and osteopenia.
3. In a DFCI ALL Consortium trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone or prednisone during all postinduction treatment phases.[[24](#cit/section_7.24)]

- Dexamethasone was associated with a superior EFS, but also with a higher frequency of infections (primarily episodes of bacteremia) and, in patients aged 10 years or older, an increased incidence of osteonecrosis and fracture.

The benefit of using dexamethasone in
children aged 10 to 18 years requires further investigation because of the increased risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis in this age
group.[[82](#cit/section_7.82),[127](#cit/section_7.127)]

##### Duration of maintenance therapy

Maintenance chemotherapy generally continues for 2 to 3 years of continuous
CR. On some studies, boys are treated longer than girls.[[71](#cit/section_7.71)] In other trials, there is no difference in the duration of treatment based on sex.[[67](#cit/section_7.67),[74](#cit/section_7.74)] It is not clear whether longer duration of maintenance therapy reduces relapse in boys, especially in the context of current therapies.[[74](#cit/section_7.74)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Extending the duration of maintenance therapy beyond 3 years
does not improve outcome.[[120](#cit/section_7.120)]

##### Adherence to oral medications during maintenance therapy

Nonadherence to treatment with mercaptopurine during maintenance therapy is associated with a significant risk of relapse.[[99](#cit/section_7.99)] A risk model has been developed to predict which patients have a high risk of nonadherence.[[129](#cit/section_7.129)]

Evidence (adherence to treatment):

1. The COG [AALL03N1 (NCT00268528)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00268528) trial studied the impact of nonadherence to mercaptopurine during maintenance therapy in 327 children and adolescents (169 Hispanic patients and 158 non-Hispanic White patients).[[99](#cit/section_7.99)]

- A progressive increase in relapse was observed with decreasing adherence to mercaptopurine, with HRs ranging between 4.0% to 5.7% for adherence rates ranging from 94.9% to 90%, 89.9% to 85%, and less than 85%. After adjusting for other prognostic factors (including NCI risk group and chromosomal abnormalities), a progressive increase in relapse was observed with decreasing adherence to mercaptopurine. MRD data were unavailable in this study population, so they were not included in the analysis of prognostic factors.
- Adherence was significantly lower among Hispanic patients, patients older than 12 years, and patients from single-mother households. However, among adherent patients, Hispanic ethnicity remained an independent predictor of adverse outcome.
2. The AALL03N1 trial also included 71 Asian American patients and 68 African American patients, in addition to the non-Hispanic White and Hispanic patients described above.[[100](#cit/section_7.100)]

- Using an adherence rate of less than 90% to define nonadherence, 20.5% of the participants were not adherent.
- An adherence rate of less than 90% was associated with increased relapse risk (HR, 3.9).
- Adherence rates were significantly lower in Asian American and African American patients than in non-Hispanic White patients.
3. In a third publication from the AALL03N1 study, the following key observations were made:[[130](#cit/section_7.130)]

- Patients with mercaptopurine nonadherence (defined as mean adherence rate of <95%) were at a 2.7-fold increased risk of relapse compared with adherers.
- Among adherers, high intra-individual variability in thioguanine levels (due to varying dose-intensity and drug treatment interruptions) was associated with increased risk of relapse.
4. The authors of the above studies also found that self-reporting was not a reliable measure of adherence, with 84% of patients overreporting compliance with taking mercaptopurine at least some of the time.[[131](#cit/section_7.131)] The data suggest that additional measures of adherence besides self-reporting are needed.
5. Another publication from the AALL03N1 study described mercaptopurine ingestion habits, red cell thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) levels, adherence, and relapse risk.[[103](#cit/section_7.103)]

- The findings showed that certain ingestion habits (e.g., taking with dairy and taking at varying times throughout the day) were associated with nonadherence. However, after adjusting for adherence and other prognostic factors, ingestion habits were not associated with relapse risk.
- For adherent patients, there was no association between TGN levels and ingestion habits.
- The authors concluded that commonly practiced restrictions surrounding mercaptopurine ingestion do not appear to impact outcome but may hinder adherence.

##### Allopurinol for mercaptopurine (6-MP) toxicity

Mercaptopurine is a critical component of maintenance therapy. Most patients tolerate the recommended doses of mercaptopurine with minimal side effects such as mild transaminitis and facial rashes. However, some patients experience more severe side effects, including liver toxicity, fasting hypoglycemia, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Mercaptopurine is metabolized to 6-thioguanine (6-TGN), which is responsible for its antileukemic effect, and also to 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MMP), which can be hepatotoxic. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase and blocks the conversion of mercaptopurine into 6-MMP via inhibition of TPMT. This results in increased production of 6-TGN and decreased 6-MMP. In several small, retrospective, single-center studies, the use of allopurinol in patients with ALL in maintenance decreased nonhematologic toxicity of mercaptopurine, especially hepatotoxicity and other GI-related side effects. Because an increase in 6-TGN metabolites is associated with myelosuppression, concurrent use of allopurinol with mercaptopurine typically requires a lower dose of mercaptopurine to avoid excessive neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.[[132](#cit/section_7.132)-[135](#cit/section_7.135)]

#### Treatment options under clinical evaluation

Risk-based treatment assignment is a key therapeutic strategy utilized for
children with ALL, and protocols are designed for specific patient populations
that have varying degrees of risk of treatment failure. The [Risk-Based Treatment Assignment](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_22) section of this summary describes the
clinical and laboratory features used for the initial stratification of
children with ALL into risk-based treatment groups.

## Central Nervous System (CNS)-Directed Therapy for Childhood ALL

### Overview of CNS-Directed Treatment Regimens

At diagnosis, approximately 3% of patients have CNS3 disease (defined as cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] specimen with ≥5 white blood cells [WBC]/μL with lymphoblasts and/or the presence of cranial nerve palsies). However, unless specific therapy is directed toward the CNS, most children will eventually develop overt CNS leukemia whether or not lymphoblasts were detected in the spinal fluid at initial diagnosis. Therefore, all children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) should receive systemic combination
chemotherapy together with some form of CNS prophylaxis.

Because the CNS is a sanctuary site (i.e., an anatomical space that is poorly penetrated by many of the systemically administered chemotherapy agents typically used to treat ALL), specific CNS-directed therapies must be instituted early in treatment to eliminate clinically evident CNS disease at diagnosis and to prevent CNS relapse in all patients. Historically, survival rates for children with ALL improved dramatically after CNS-directed therapies were added to treatment regimens.

Standard treatment options for CNS-directed therapy include the following:

1. [Intrathecal chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1376).
2. [CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1377).
3. [Cranial radiation therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1378).

All of these treatment modalities have a role in the treatment and prevention of CNS leukemia. The combination of intrathecal chemotherapy plus CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy is standard. Cranial radiation is reserved for select situations.[[1](#cit/section_8.1)]

The type of CNS-therapy that is used is based on a patient’s risk of CNS-relapse, with higher-risk patients receiving more intensive treatments. Data suggest that the following groups of patients are at increased risk of CNS relapse:

- Patients with 5 or more WBC/µL and blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (CNS3), obtained at diagnosis.
- Patients with blasts in the CSF but fewer than 5 WBC/µL (CNS2) may be at increased risk of CNS relapse,[[2](#cit/section_8.2)] although this risk appears to be nearly fully abrogated if they receive more doses of intrathecal chemotherapy, especially during the induction phase.[[3](#cit/section_8.3)]
- Patients with T-ALL, especially those with high presenting peripheral blood leukocyte counts.
- Patients who have a traumatic lumbar puncture showing blasts at the time of diagnosis may have an increased risk of CNS relapse. These patients receive more intensive CNS-directed therapy on some treatment protocols.[[3](#cit/section_8.3),[4](#cit/section_8.4)]

CNS-directed treatment regimens for newly diagnosed childhood ALL are presented in [Table 11](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1300).

Table 11. CNS-Directed Treatment Regimens for Newly Diagnosed Childhood ALL

| Disease Status | Standard Treatment Options | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ALL = acute lymphoblastic leukemia; CNS = central nervous system; CNS3 = cerebrospinal fluid with ≥5 white blood cells/µL, cytospin positive for blasts, or cranial nerve palsies. | | |
| aThe drug itself is not CNS-penetrant, but leads to cerebrospinal fluid asparagine depletion. | | |
| [Standard-risk ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1379) | [Intrathecal chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1376) | |
|  | Methotrexate alone |
|  | Methotrexate with cytarabine and hydrocortisone |
| [CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1377) | |
|  | Dexamethasone |
|  | L-asparaginasea |
|  | High-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue |
|  | Escalating-dose intravenous methotrexate (no leucovorin rescue) |
| [High-risk and very high-risk ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1380) | [Intrathecal chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1376) | |
|  | Methotrexate alone |
|  | Methotrexate with cytarabine and hydrocortisone |
| [CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1377) | |
|  | Dexamethasone |
|  | L-asparaginasea |
|  | High-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue |
| [Cranial radiation therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1378) | |

A major goal of current ALL clinical trials is to provide effective CNS therapy while minimizing neurological toxic effects and other late effects.

### Intrathecal Chemotherapy

All therapeutic regimens for childhood ALL include intrathecal chemotherapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually started at the beginning of induction, intensified during consolidation and, in many protocols, continued throughout the maintenance phase.

Intrathecal chemotherapy typically consists of one of the following:[[5](#cit/section_8.5)]

1. Methotrexate alone.
2. Methotrexate with cytarabine and hydrocortisone (triple intrathecal chemotherapy).

Unlike intrathecal cytarabine, intrathecal methotrexate has a significant systemic effect, which may contribute to prevention of marrow relapse.[[6](#cit/section_8.6)]

### CNS-Directed Systemic Chemotherapy

In addition to therapy delivered directly to the brain and spinal fluid, systemically administered agents are also an important component of effective CNS prophylaxis. The following systemically administered drugs provide some degree of CNS prophylaxis:

- Dexamethasone.
- L-asparaginase (does not penetrate into CSF itself, but leads to CSF asparagine depletion).[[7](#cit/section_8.7)]
- High-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue.
- Escalating dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate without leucovorin rescue.

Evidence (CNS-directed systemic chemotherapy):

1. In a randomized Children's Cancer Group (CCG) study of standard-risk patients who all received the same dose and schedule of intrathecal methotrexate without cranial irradiation, oral dexamethasone was associated with a 50% decrease in the rate of CNS relapse compared with oral prednisone.[[8](#cit/section_8.8)]
2. In another standard-risk ALL trial ([COG-1991](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005945)), escalating dose IV methotrexate without leucovorin rescue significantly reduced the CNS relapse rate compared with standard, low-dose, oral methotrexate given during each of two interim maintenance phases.[[9](#cit/section_8.9)]
3. In a randomized clinical trial conducted by the former Pediatric Oncology Group, T-ALL patients who received high-dose methotrexate experienced a significantly lower CNS relapse rate than did patients who did not receive high-dose methotrexate.[[10](#cit/section_8.10)]

### Cranial Radiation Therapy

The proportion of patients receiving cranial radiation therapy has decreased significantly over time. At present, most newly diagnosed children with ALL are treated without cranial radiation therapy. Many groups administer cranial radiation therapy only to those patients considered to be at highest risk of subsequent CNS relapse, such as those with documented CNS leukemia at diagnosis (as defined above) (≥5 WBC/μL with blasts; CNS3) and/or T-cell phenotype with high presenting WBC count.[[11](#cit/section_8.11)] Some centers do not use cranial irradiation for any patients.[[12](#cit/section_8.12)]

In patients who do receive radiation therapy, the cranial radiation dose has been significantly reduced and administration of spinal irradiation is not standard.

Ongoing trials seek to determine whether radiation therapy can be eliminated from the treatment of all children with newly diagnosed ALL without compromising survival or leading to increased rate of toxicities from upfront and salvage therapies.[[12](#cit/section_8.12),[13](#cit/section_8.13)] A meta-analysis of randomized trials of CNS-directed therapy has confirmed that radiation therapy can be replaced by intrathecal chemotherapy in most patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Additional systemic therapy may be required depending on the agents and intensity used.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)]; [[1](#cit/section_8.1)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### CNS Therapy for Standard-Risk Patients

Intrathecal chemotherapy without cranial radiation therapy, given in the context of appropriate systemic chemotherapy, results in CNS relapse rates of less than 5% for children with standard-risk ALL.[[12](#cit/section_8.12),[13](#cit/section_8.13),[15](#cit/section_8.15)-[18](#cit/section_8.18)]

The use of cranial radiation therapy is not a necessary component of CNS-directed therapy for these patients.[[19](#cit/section_8.19),[20](#cit/section_8.20)] Some regimens use triple intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone), while others use intrathecal methotrexate alone throughout therapy.

Evidence (triple intrathecal chemotherapy vs. intrathecal methotrexate):

1. The [CCG-1952](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002744) study for National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard-risk patients compared the relative efficacy and toxicity of triple intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone) with methotrexate as the sole intrathecal agent in nonirradiated patients.[[21](#cit/section_8.21)]

1. There was no significant difference in either CNS or non-CNS toxicities.
2. Although triple intrathecal chemotherapy was associated with a lower rate of isolated CNS relapse (3.4% ± 1.0% compared with 5.9% ± 1.2% for intrathecal methotrexate; *P* = .004), there was no difference in event-free survival (EFS) rates.

- The reduction in CNS relapse rate was especially notable in patients with CNS2 status at diagnosis (lymphoblasts seen in CSF cytospin, but with <5 WBC/high-power field on CSF cell count). The isolated CNS relapse rate was 7.7% (± 5.3%) for CNS2 patients who received triple intrathecal chemotherapy, compared with 23.0% (± 9.5%) for those who received intrathecal methotrexate alone (*P* = .04).
- There were more bone marrow relapses in the group that received the triple intrathecal chemotherapy, leading to a worse overall survival (OS) rate (90.3% ± 1.5%) compared with the intrathecal methotrexate group (94.4% ± 1.1%; *P* = .01).
- When the analysis was restricted to patients with B-ALL and rapid early response (M1 marrow on day 14), there was no difference between triple and single intrathecal chemotherapy in terms of rates of CNS relapse, OS, or EFS rates.
- The findings of this trial need to be interpreted within the context of other therapy administered to patients. Dexamethasone, which has been associated with lower CNS relapse rates and improved EFS rates in standard-risk patients in other trials,[[8](#cit/section_8.8),[22](#cit/section_8.22)] was not used in CCG-1952 (prednisone was the only steroid administered to patients).[[23](#cit/section_8.23)] It is not clear whether the results of the CCG-1952 trial are generalizable to protocols that include the use of dexamethasone and/or other CNS-directed systemic therapies.
3. In a follow-up study of neurocognitive functioning in the two groups, there were no clinically significant differences.[[24](#cit/section_8.24)][[Level of evidence A3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810021&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### CNS Therapy for High-Risk and Very High-Risk Patients Without CNS Involvement

#### Intrathecal chemotherapy

Approaches to intrathecal therapy have also been studied in high-risk patients.

Evidence (triple intrathecal chemotherapy vs. intrathecal methotrexate):

1. The COG [AALL1131 (NCT02883049)](/clinicaltrials/NCT02883049) study for NCI high-risk patients and NCI standard-risk B-ALL patients with slow early response (defined by day 8 peripheral blood MRD and/or day 29 marrow MRD) randomly assigned patients aged 1 to 30 years to receive either postinduction intrathecal methotrexate or triple intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone). Patients with CNS3 disease were not eligible, and patients on this trial did not receive cranial radiation. Postinduction intrathecal therapy was administered for a total of 21 to 26 doses. Neurocognitive assessments were performed in a subset of patients aged 6 to 12 years at initial diagnosis.[[25](#cit/section_8.25)]

- The 5-year postinduction disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 93.2% (± 2.1%) for patients randomly assigned to intrathecal methotrexate and 90.6% (± 2.3%) (*P* = .85) for patients assigned to triple intrathecal chemotherapy.
- The OS rates were 96.3% (± 1.5%) for patients who received intrathecal methotrexate and 96.7% (± 1.4%) (*P* = .77) for patients who received triple intrathecal chemotherapy.
- There were no differences in the cumulative incidence of isolated bone marrow relapse, isolated CNS relapse, or combined bone marrow and CNS relapse between the two arms.
- There were no significant differences in neurological toxicities or in assessments of neurocognitive functioning during treatment for patients who received intrathecal methotrexate compared with patients who received triple intrathecal chemotherapy.

#### Cranial radiation therapy

Controversy exists as to whether high-risk and very high-risk patients should be treated with cranial radiation therapy, although there is a growing consensus that cranial radiation therapy may not be necessary for most of these patients.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)] Indications for cranial radiation therapy on some treatment regimens have included the following:[[11](#cit/section_8.11)]

- Patients with T-cell phenotype and high initial WBC count.
- Patients with high-risk B-ALL and extremely high presenting leukocyte counts and/or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities.

Both the proportion of patients receiving radiation therapy and the dose of radiation administered have decreased over the last two decades.

Evidence (cranial radiation therapy):

1. In a trial conducted between 1990 and 1995, the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) group demonstrated that a reduced dose of prophylactic radiation (12 Gy instead of 18 Gy) provided effective CNS prophylaxis in high-risk patients.[[26](#cit/section_8.26)]
2. In the follow-up trial conducted by the BFM group between 1995 and 2000 (BFM-95), cranial radiation therapy was administered to approximately 20% of patients (compared with 70% on the previous trial), including patients with T-cell phenotype, a slow early response (as measured by peripheral blood blast count after a 1-week steroid prophase), and/or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities.[[18](#cit/section_8.18)]

- While the rate of isolated CNS relapses was higher in the nonirradiated higher-risk patients compared with historical (irradiated) cohorts, their overall EFS rates were not significantly different.
3. Several groups, including the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), have published results of trials that omitted cranial radiation therapy for all patients, including high-risk subsets.[[12](#cit/section_8.12),[13](#cit/section_8.13),[27](#cit/section_8.27)] Most of these trials have included at least four doses of high-dose methotrexate during postinduction consolidation and an increased frequency of intrathecal chemotherapy. The SJCRH and DCOG studies also included frequent vincristine/dexamethasone pulses and intensified dosing of pegaspargase,[[12](#cit/section_8.12),[13](#cit/section_8.13)] while the EORTC trials included additional high-dose methotrexate and multiple doses of high-dose cytarabine during postinduction treatment phases for patients with CNS3 status (CSF
with ≥5 WBC/µL and cytospin positive for blasts).[[27](#cit/section_8.27)]

- The 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated CNS relapse on those trials was between 2% and 4%, although some patient subsets had a significantly higher rate of CNS relapse. On the SJCRH study, clinical features associated with a significantly higher risk of isolated CNS relapse included T-cell phenotype, the t(1;19) translocation, and the presence of blasts in the CSF at diagnosis.[[12](#cit/section_8.12)]
- The overall EFS rate was 85.6% for the SJCRH study and 81% for the DCOG study—both in line with outcomes achieved by contemporaneously conducted clinical trials on which some patients received prophylactic radiation therapy—but was lower on the EORTC trial (8-year EFS rate, 69.6%).[[27](#cit/section_8.27)]
- On the SJCRH study, 33 of 498 patients (6.6%) in first remission with high-risk features (including 26 patients with high minimal residual disease [MRD], 6 with *BCR*::*ABL1*-positive ALL, and 1 with near haploidy) received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which included total-body irradiation.[[12](#cit/section_8.12)]
4. In a meta-analysis of aggregated data from more than 16,000 patients treated between 1996 and 2007 by ten cooperative groups, the use of cranial radiation therapy did not appear to impact 5-year OS or cumulative incidence of any event.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)]

- In subgroup analyses of high-risk subsets, only those with CNS3 status at diagnosis appeared to benefit from cranial radiation, with a significantly lower rate of CNS relapses (isolated/any) in irradiated patients. However, even within this subgroup, OS rates were similar with or without the use of radiation therapy.
- This study suggests that cranial radiation therapy may not be an essential component of treatment, even for high-risk patients. However, interpretation is limited by the considerable variation in treatment administered to patients by the different cooperative groups.
5. The EORTC-58832 trial that was conducted between 1983 and 1989 included patients with medium-risk and high-risk ALL. Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive cranial radiation after intensification and before maintenance therapy.[[28](#cit/section_8.28)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The 25-year EFS and OS rates in the two arms of the trial were similar: the EFS rate was 59.5% and the OS rate was 78.1% for patients who did not receive cranial radiation; the EFS rate was 60.5% and the OS rate was 78.5% for patients who received cranial radiation.
- There was a dramatic decrease in the rate of late CNS adverse events in the patients who did not receive cranial radiation therapy.
- The incidence of second neoplasms was also decreased in patients who did not receive radiation (7.3%) compared with patients who did receive radiation (13%) (HR, 0.43). Meningiomas accounted for the increased incidence of second neoplasms in the cranial radiation group.

### CNS Therapy for Patients With CNS3 Disease at Diagnosis

Therapy for ALL patients with clinically evident CNS disease (≥5 WBC/high-power field with blasts on cytospin; cranial nerve palsies-CNS3) at diagnosis typically includes intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial radiation therapy (usual dose is 18 Gy).[[18](#cit/section_8.18),[20](#cit/section_8.20)] Spinal radiation is no longer used.

Evidence (cranial radiation therapy):

1. The SJCRH, DCOG, and the EORTC have published results of trials that omitted cranial radiation therapy for all patients, including high-risk subsets.[[12](#cit/section_8.12),[27](#cit/section_8.27)] These trials have included at least four doses of high-dose methotrexate during postinduction consolidation and an increased frequency of intrathecal chemotherapy. The SJCRH study also included higher cumulative doses of anthracycline than on Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trials, and frequent vincristine/dexamethasone pulses and intensified dosing of pegaspargase,[[12](#cit/section_8.12)] while the EORTC trials included additional high-dose methotrexate and multiple doses of high-dose cytarabine, during postinduction treatment phases for CNS3 (CSF
with ≥5 WBC/µL and cytospin positive for blasts) patients.[[27](#cit/section_8.27)]

- On the SJCRH [Total XV (TOTXV)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00137111) study, patients with CNS3 status (N = 9) were treated without cranial radiation therapy (observed 5-year EFS rate, 43% ± 23%; OS rate, 71% ± 22%).[[12](#cit/section_8.12)] On this study, CNS leukemia at diagnosis (defined as CNS3 status or traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts) was an independent predictor of inferior EFS.
- On the DCOG-9 trial, the 5-year EFS rate of CNS3 patients (n = 21) treated without cranial radiation therapy was 67% (± 10%).[[13](#cit/section_8.13)]
- On the EORTC trial, the 8-year EFS rate of CNS3 patients (n = 49) treated without cranial radiation therapy was 68%. The cumulative incidence of isolated CNS relapse for those patients was 9.4%.[[27](#cit/section_8.27)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
2. A meta-analysis of aggregated data from more than 16,000 patients treated between 1996 and 2007 by ten cooperative groups evaluated whether the use of cranial radiation therapy affected outcome in high-risk patient subsets.[[14](#cit/section_8.14)]

- In subgroup analyses of high-risk subsets, only those with CNS3 status at diagnosis appeared to benefit from cranial radiation therapy, with a significantly lower rate of CNS relapses (isolated/any) in irradiated patients. However, even within this subgroup, OS rates were similar with or without the use of radiation therapy.

Larger prospective studies will be necessary to fully elucidate the safety of omitting cranial radiation therapy in CNS3 patients.

Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search"). For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the [ClinicalTrials.gov website](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/").

### Toxicity of CNS-Directed Therapy

Toxic effects of CNS-directed therapy for childhood ALL can be acute and subacute or late developing. For more information, see the [Late Effects of the Central Nervous System](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq#_9) section in Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer.

#### Acute and subacute toxicities

The most common acute side effect associated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone is seizures. Up to 5% of nonirradiated patients
with ALL treated with frequent doses of intrathecal chemotherapy will have at least one seizure during therapy.[[12](#cit/section_8.12)] Higher rates of seizure were observed with consolidation regimens that included 12 courses of intermediate-dose IV methotrexate (1 g/m2) given every 2 weeks with intrathecal chemotherapy.[[29](#cit/section_8.29)] Intrathecal and high-dose IV methotrexate have also been associated with a stroke-like syndrome, which, in most cases, appears to be reversible.[[30](#cit/section_8.30)]

Patients with ALL
who develop seizures during the course of treatment and who receive anticonvulsant therapy should not receive phenobarbital or phenytoin as
anticonvulsant treatment, as these drugs may increase the clearance of some
chemotherapeutic drugs and adversely affect treatment outcome.[[31](#cit/section_8.31)]

#### Late-developing toxicities

Late effects associated with CNS-directed therapies include subsequent neoplasms, neuroendocrine disturbances, leukoencephalopathy, and neurocognitive impairments.

Subsequent neoplasms are observed primarily in survivors who received cranial radiation therapy. Meningiomas are the most commonly observed second neoplasm and are most often of low malignant potential. However, high-grade lesions can also occur. In a SJCRH retrospective study of more than 1,290 patients with ALL who had never relapsed, the 30-year cumulative incidence of a subsequent neoplasm occurring in the CNS was 3%. Excluding meningiomas, the 30-year cumulative incidence was 1.17%.[[32](#cit/section_8.32)] Nearly all of these CNS subsequent neoplasms occurred in previously irradiated patients. In a Pediatric Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (PENTEC) report on subsequent malignancies, patients who received radiation therapy to the brain had a pooled excess relative ratio per Gy of 0.44 for subsequent meningiomas. Patients treated with 12 Gy of radiation therapy have a substantially lower potential for developing meningiomas than those treated with 24 Gy.[[33](#cit/section_8.33)]

Neurocognitive impairments, which can range in severity and functional consequences, have been documented in long-term ALL survivors treated both with and without radiation therapy. In general,
patients treated without cranial radiation therapy have less severe neurocognitive sequelae than irradiated patients, and the
deficits that do develop represent relatively modest declines in a limited
number of domains of neuropsychological functioning.[[34](#cit/section_8.34)-[37](#cit/section_8.37)] For patients who receive cranial radiation therapy, the frequency and severity of toxicities appear dose-related. Patients treated with 18 Gy of cranial radiation therapy appear to be at lower risk of severe impairments compared with those treated with doses of 24 Gy or higher. Younger age at diagnosis and female sex have been reported in many studies to be associated with a higher risk of neurocognitive late effects.[[38](#cit/section_8.38)]

Several studies have also evaluated the impact of other components of treatment on the development of late neurocognitive impairments. A comparison of neurocognitive outcomes of patients treated with methotrexate versus triple intrathecal chemotherapy showed no clinically meaningful difference.[[24](#cit/section_8.24)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Controversy exists about whether patients who receive dexamethasone have a higher risk of neurocognitive disturbances.[[39](#cit/section_8.39)]
In a SJCRH study of nonirradiated long-term survivors, treatment with dexamethasone was associated with increased risk of impairments in attention and executive function.[[40](#cit/section_8.40)] Conversely, long-term neurocognitive testing in 92 children with a history of standard-risk ALL who had received either dexamethasone or prednisone during treatment did not demonstrate any meaningful differences in cognitive functioning based on corticosteroid randomization.[[41](#cit/section_8.41)] In the COG [AALL0232](/clinicaltrials/NCT00075725) study, patients with high-risk ALL were randomly assigned to receive either prednisone or dexamethasone during induction therapy.[[42](#cit/section_8.42)] Neurocognitive testing was done 8 to 24 months after treatment. Mean scores for all attention and executive functioning measures were in the average range, and there was no difference in scores between the patients who received prednisone and the patients who received dexamethasone. In the same study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose methotrexate or escalating methotrexate. There were no differences in attention or executive functioning scores between the two treatment groups.[[42](#cit/section_8.42)]

Investigators have also examined whether exposure to anesthetic agents affects neurocognition in children who undergo treatment for ALL. One study included 144 patients with high-risk B-ALL (aged 6–12 years at diagnosis), and only 2% of these patients received cranial radiation. Higher cumulative exposure to propofol (frequently used as sedation for lumbar punctures during treatment) was associated with impairment in reaction time/processing speed in neurocognitive testing performed 1 year after the completion of ALL therapy.[[43](#cit/section_8.43)] Another study from SJCRH included 212 survivors of childhood ALL (all at least 5 years from initial diagnosis). Greater exposure to propofol and fluranes and longer cumulative anesthesia duration were associated with increased risks of general neurocognitive impairment and dysfunction on tests of processing speed and attention.[[44](#cit/section_8.44)] The long-term implication of these findings awaits longer follow-up.

Evidence (neurocognitive late effects of cranial radiation):

1. A SJCRH study of 567 adult long-term survivors of childhood ALL underwent neurocognitive testing (mean time from diagnosis, 26 years).[[40](#cit/section_8.40)]

- Patients treated with 24 Gy of cranial radiation therapy showed the highest rates of impairment. Up to one-third of these patients demonstrated impairments (defined as test scores 2 or more standard deviations below age-adjusted national norms) in attention, memory, processing speed, and executive function.
- Significantly fewer patients who had received 18 Gy of cranial radiation therapy demonstrated severe impairments compared with those who had received 24 Gy. In general, there was no significant difference in rates of impairment between nonirradiated survivors and those who received 18 Gy of cranial radiation therapy. However, the 18-Gy group was at increased risk of academic problems.
- In addition to being dose-related, the neurocognitive impact of cranial radiation therapy was also dependent on age at diagnosis, with higher frequency of impairments in patients diagnosed at a younger age.
2. A study compared memory impairment in patients who received 18 Gy of cranial radiation therapy (n = 127) versus 24 Gy of cranial radiation therapy (n = 138).[[45](#cit/section_8.45)]

- Long-term survivors who received 24 Gy of cranial radiation therapy demonstrated significant impairments in immediate and delayed memory, compared with survivors who received 18 Gy.
3. In a randomized trial comparing irradiated (at a dose of 18 Gy) and nonirradiated standard-risk ALL patients, the following was observed: [[34](#cit/section_8.34)][[Level of evidence A3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810021&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Cognitive function for both groups (assessed at a median of 6 years postdiagnosis) was in the average range, with only subtle differences noted between the groups in cognitive skills.
4. In a randomized trial, hyperfractionated radiation therapy (at a dose of 18 Gy) did not decrease neurological late effects when compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy. Cognitive function for both groups was not significantly impaired.[[46](#cit/section_8.46)]

Evidence (neurocognitive late effects in nonirradiated patients):

1. In the SJCRH long-term follow-up study of 567 adult long-term survivors, some nonirradiated patients also demonstrated neurocognitive impairments.[[40](#cit/section_8.40)]

- The age-adjusted mean test scores for nonirradiated patients were very similar to that of expected national norms. However, approximately 15% of the nonirradiated survivors participating in this study demonstrated impairments in some domains, including attention, memory, processing speed, and executive function.
- Despite the impairments noted on neurocognitive testing, overall, the educational attainment and employment status of the tested ALL survivors were similar to age- and sex-adjusted expected proportions using census data for the U.S. population.
2. In a second study from SJCRH, patients enrolled on Total Study XV (which omitted cranial radiation therapy in all patients) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments at induction, end of maintenance, and 2 years after completion of therapy.[[47](#cit/section_8.47)]

- Neurocognitive function was largely age appropriate 2 years after completing therapy, without evidence of excess impairment on measures of intellectual functioning, academic abilities, learning, and memory. Problems with sustained attention were observed at an increased frequency in this population compared with normative expectations.
- High-risk patients who received more intensive CNS-directed chemotherapy (including high-dose methotrexate and more doses of intrathecal chemotherapy) were at greater risk of difficulties in attention, processing speed, and academics.
3. In a subsequent study from the SJCRH, 400 patients in the Total XVI study (enrolled between 2007 and 2017) underwent neurocognitive testing after the completion of therapy (approximately 3 years from diagnosis). None of the patients received cranial radiation, but the number of doses of triple intrathecal therapy (ITT) chemotherapy varied by risk group and CNS status. Patients with low-risk ALL were prescribed 13 to 21 doses, while patients with standard- and high-risk ALL were prescribed 16 to 27 doses.[[48](#cit/section_8.48)]

- Compared with age-normative expectations, the entire patient cohort exhibited neurocognitive impairments in multiple domains, including attention, working memory, executive function, fine motor skills, and adaptive skills.
- For patients with low-risk ALL, there was no correlation between the number of ITT doses (<20 vs. >21) and neurocognitive measures.
- For patients with standard- and high-risk ALL, those who received the highest number of ITT doses (>27) had an increased risk of impairment than those who received fewer doses, especially in working memory, attention, and fine motor skills.
- Patients with public or no insurance had worse neurocognitive outcomes than those with private insurance.
- Among patients with standard- and high-risk ALL, boys had a higher risk of neurocognitive impairments than girls, as did patients who were younger at diagnosis.
- The clinical manifestations of the neurocognitive impairments (if any) found by end-of-treatment neurocognitive testing, and their trajectories over time, were not evaluated in this study.
4. In the COG [AALL06N1 (NCT00437060)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00437060) trial, patients with high-risk B-ALL who had been enrolled in the AALL0232 trial received a neurocognitive evaluation. These patients had been randomly assigned to receive either high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue or escalating-dose IV methotrexate with pegasparaginase during the interim maintenance phase of therapy in the AALL0232 trial. A neurocognitive evaluation, which included an assessment of intellectual function (estimated intelligence quotient [IQ]), working memory, and processing speed, was conducted after the completion of therapy.[[49](#cit/section_8.49)]

- The method of methotrexate delivery was unrelated to differences in neurocognitive outcomes after controlling for ethnicity, race, age, gender, insurance status, and time off treatment.
- Survivors younger than 10 years at diagnosis had a statistically significantly lower estimated IQ and processing speed scores than older patients.
- Additionally, patients with public health insurance had significantly lower estimated IQ scores than participants with U.S. private or military insurance.

## Postinduction Treatment for Specific ALL Subgroups

### T-ALL

Historically, patients with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have had a worse prognosis than children with B-ALL. In a review of a large number of patients treated on Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials over a 15-year period, T-cell immunophenotype still proved to be a negative prognostic factor on multivariate analysis.[[1](#cit/section_9.1)] However, with current treatment regimens, outcomes for children with T-ALL are now approaching those achieved for children with B-ALL. For example, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium reported a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of 81% and an overall survival (OS) rate of 90% for patients with T-ALL who were treated on two consecutive clinical trials between 2005 and 2015.[[2](#cit/section_9.2)] Another example is the COG [AALL0434 (NCT00408005)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00408005) trial for T-ALL that resulted in a 5-year EFS rate of 83.8% and an OS rate of 89.5%.[[3](#cit/section_9.3)]

#### Treatment options for T-ALL

Treatment options for T-ALL include the following:

1. Chemotherapy with or without prophylactic cranial radiation therapy.

Evidence (chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial radiation therapy):

1. Protocols of the former Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) treated children with T-ALL differently from children with B-ALL. On the [POG-9404](/clinicaltrials/NCT01230983) protocol, patients with T-ALL were treated using a regimen based on the DFCI 87-001 protocol, which included multiple doses of L-asparaginase and doxorubicin during postinduction therapy, as well as prophylactic cranial radiation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to either the high-dose methotrexate arm or the control arm.[[4](#cit/section_9.4)]

- Patients randomly assigned to receive high-dose methotrexate achieved a superior outcome (10-year EFS rates were 78% with high-dose methotrexate vs. 68% for the control arm).[[5](#cit/section_9.5),[6](#cit/section_9.6)]
2. In the POG-9404 study, patients were also randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin with or without dexrazoxane to determine the efficacy of dexrazoxane in preventing late cardiac mortality.[[7](#cit/section_9.7)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- There was no difference in EFS between patients with T-ALL who were treated with dexrazoxane and patients who were not treated with dexrazoxane (cumulative doxorubicin dose, 360 mg/m2).[[7](#cit/section_9.7)]
- The frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 toxicities that occurred during therapy was similar between the randomized groups, and there was no difference in cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasms. Three years after initial diagnosis, left ventricular shortening fraction and left ventricular wall thickness were both significantly worse in patients who received doxorubicin alone than in patients who received dexrazoxane, indicating that dexrazoxane was cardioprotective.[[7](#cit/section_9.7)]
- With combined data from three COG trials that randomized dexrazoxane with doxorubicin therapy (P9404, P9425, and P9426) and had a median follow-up of 12.6 years, dexrazoxane did not appear to compromise long-term survival.[[8](#cit/section_9.8)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
3. On protocols of the former Children’s Cancer Group (CCG), children with T-ALL received the same treatment regimens as did children with B-ALL. Protocol and treatment assignment were based on the patients' clinical characteristics (e.g., age and white blood cell [WBC] count) and the disease response to initial therapy. Most children with T-ALL met National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk criteria.

- Results from the [CCG-1961](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002812) trial for high-risk ALL, which included patients with T-ALL, showed that an augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) regimen with a single delayed intensification course produced the best results for patients with morphological rapid response to initial induction therapy (estimated 5-year EFS rate, 83%).[[9](#cit/section_9.9),[10](#cit/section_9.10)] With this approach, patients with a presenting WBC count greater than 200,000 had similar outcomes to those with a WBC count of less than 200,000.[[11](#cit/section_9.11)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- Overall results from POG-9404 and CCG-1961 were similar, although POG-9404 used a higher cumulative dose of anthracyclines and cranial radiation therapy for every patient, while CCG-1961 used cranial radiation therapy only for patients with slow morphological response.[[10](#cit/section_9.10),[5](#cit/section_9.5)]
- Among children with NCI standard-risk T-ALL treated on the [CCG-1952](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002744), [COG-1991](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005945), and POG-9404 trials, the 7-year EFS rates were comparable with those of patients treated with the CCG regimens that used significantly less anthracycline in a less intensive chemotherapy backbone without the prophylactic cranial irradiation included in POG-9404.[[12](#cit/section_9.12)] However, the patients with NCI standard-risk T-ALL had an inferior EFS and OS compared with patients with NCI standard-risk B-ALL treated with the same regimens on the CCG-1952 and COG-1991 trials.[[12](#cit/section_9.12)]
4. In the COG, children with T-ALL are not treated on the same protocols as children with B-ALL.

1. Pilot studies from the COG have demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating nelarabine (a nucleoside analog with demonstrated activity in patients with relapsed and refractory T-cell lymphoblastic disease) in the context of a BFM regimen for patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL.[[13](#cit/section_9.13)-[15](#cit/section_9.15)]

- The pilot study showed a 5-year EFS rate of 73% for all patients who received nelarabine and 69% for those patients with a slow early response.[[16](#cit/section_9.16)]
2. The COG [AALL0434 (NCT00408005)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00408005) trial enrolled 1,562 evaluable patients aged 1 to 31 years with T-ALL. Patients received an augmented BFM regimen and were randomly assigned to receive an interim maintenance phase with either high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue or escalating-dose methotrexate without leucovorin but with pegaspargase.[[3](#cit/section_9.3)] Intermediate-risk and high-risk patients were also randomly assigned to receive either six courses of nelarabine during postinduction treatment or no nelarabine.[[17](#cit/section_9.17)] Nearly all patients received either prophylactic (12 Gy) or therapeutic (18 Gy) cranial irradiation. Only 10% of patients considered to be low risk were not irradiated. Patients assigned to the escalating-dose methotrexate arm received cranial radiation therapy earlier than did patients assigned to the high-dose methotrexate arm (week 8 vs. week 26). Patients on the escalating-dose methotrexate arm also received two additional doses of pegaspargase. Results were as follows:[[3](#cit/section_9.3),[17](#cit/section_9.17),[18](#cit/section_9.18)]

- The overall 5-year EFS rate was 83.8%, and the OS rate was 89.5%. On multivariable analysis, high end-induction MRD (>0.1%) and elevated presenting WBC count (>200 × 103) were each independent predictors of inferior outcome.[[18](#cit/section_9.18)]
- Results indicated a better disease-free survival (DFS) for patients who were randomly assigned to the escalating-dose methotrexate arm (5-year DFS rate, 91.5%) than for patients randomly assigned to the high-dose methotrexate arm (5-year DFS rate, 85.3%; *P* = .005).
- For intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, treatment with nelarabine was associated with a superior outcome (5-year DFS rate, 88.2% with nelarabine vs. 82.1% without nelarabine; *P* = .029). The 5-year cumulative incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse was significantly lower for patients treated with nelarabine (1.3% vs. 6.9% in the no-nelarabine arm).
- The best outcome for intermediate-risk and high-risk patients was observed in those randomly assigned to both the escalating-dose methotrexate and nelarabine arms (5-year DFS rate, 91.4%). The worst outcome was observed in patients randomly assigned to receive high-dose methotrexate and no nelarabine (5-year DFS rate, 78.1%).
- For patients with CNS3 disease, all of whom were assigned to receive high-dose methotrexate and 18 Gy of cranial radiation therapy, nelarabine was associated with significantly superior DFS.[[19](#cit/section_9.19)]
- Patients with initial induction failure (M3 marrow at day 29, n = 43) were nonrandomly assigned to receive high-dose methotrexate and nelarabine; 20 of these patients were removed from the protocol therapy to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR). The overall 5-year EFS rate for induction-failure patients was 53%, with no difference in outcomes between HSCT and chemotherapy.
3. In the successor COG [AALL1231 (NCT02112916)](/clinicaltrials/NCT02112916) trial for T-ALL, patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib during induction and delayed intensification phases. Patients with initial induction failure (M3 marrow at day 29) or high MRD (≥0.1%) at end of consolidation were nonrandomly assigned to receive three additional intensified chemotherapy blocks postconsolidation. Other nonrandomized changes to treatment included the use of dexamethasone during induction (instead of prednisone) and omission of cranial radiation therapy for all but the very high-risk patients. Because the results of AALL0434 trial were not known at the time that AALL1231 opened, nelarabine was not included in the chemotherapy backbone. The trial was designed to enroll 1,200 patients but closed to accrual early (after 824 evaluable patients had enrolled) once the results of the nelarabine randomization on AALL0434 were released.[[20](#cit/section_9.20)]

- Comparing patients with T-ALL assigned to receive bortezomib versus patients who did not receive bortezomib, there was no difference in the 4-year EFS rate (82.9% vs. 81.5%; *P* = .396) or the 5-year OS rate (87.9% vs. 88.3%; *P* = .469).
- Subset analyses were performed comparing similar patients with T-ALL scheduled to receive 12 Gy cranial radiation therapy on the AALL0434 trial (90.8% of patients), but not on the AALL1231 trial (9.5% of patients). Excluding patients who received nelarabine (AALL0434) or bortezomib (AALL1231), the 4-year EFS (*P* = .412), OS (*P* = .600), cumulative incidence of CNS relapse (*P* = .456), and overall relapse (*P* = .836) rates were not significantly different between the studies, indicating that the omission of cranial radiation (in the context of the AALL1231 chemotherapy backbone) did not adversely impact outcome.
- While the 4-year EFS rates were similar between the AALL1231 and AALL0434 trials (*P* = .131), the 4-year OS rate on the AALL1231 trial was inferior to that on the AALL0434 trial (87% vs. 90%, *P* = .006).
- While the cumulative incidence of relapse was similar in both studies (*P* = .562), there was a higher rate of treatment-related mortality on the AALL1231 trial, compared with the AALL0434 trial (6.1% vs. 2.0%). Rates of treatment-related mortality were higher on the AALL1231 trial during both induction (1.5% vs. 0.4%, *P* = .002) and postinduction treatment phases (3.9% vs. 2.1%, *P* = .008).
- Despite intensification of the chemotherapy backbone, outcome was poor for patients with T-ALL assigned to the very high-risk group (5.2% of patients). The 4-year EFS rate was 31.3% for patients on the no-bortezomib arm, compared with 7.8% for patients on the bortezomib arm (*P* = .033).

The use of prophylactic cranial radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with T-ALL is declining. Some groups, such as St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) and the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), do not use cranial radiation therapy in first-line treatment of ALL. Other groups, such as DFCI, COG, and BFM, are now limiting radiation therapy to patients with very high-risk features or CNS3 disease.

### Infants With ALL

Infant ALL is uncommon, representing approximately 2% to 4% of cases of childhood ALL.[[21](#cit/section_9.21)] Because of their distinctive biological characteristics and their high risk of
leukemia recurrence, infants with ALL are treated on protocols specifically
designed for this patient population. Common therapeutic themes of the intensive chemotherapy regimens used to treat infants with ALL are the inclusion of postinduction intensification courses with high doses of cytarabine and methotrexate.[[22](#cit/section_9.22)-[25](#cit/section_9.25)]

Infants diagnosed within the first few months of life have a particularly poor outcome. In one study, patients diagnosed within 1 month of birth had a 2-year OS rate of 20%.[[26](#cit/section_9.26)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] In another study, the 5-year EFS rate for infants diagnosed at younger than 90 days was 16%.[[24](#cit/section_9.24)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

For infants with *KMT2A* gene rearrangements, the EFS rates at 4 to 5 years continue to be in the 35% range.[[22](#cit/section_9.22)-[24](#cit/section_9.24),[27](#cit/section_9.27),[28](#cit/section_9.28)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Factors predicting poor outcome for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements include the following:[[23](#cit/section_9.23),[24](#cit/section_9.24)]; [[29](#cit/section_9.29)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[30](#cit/section_9.30)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Younger age at diagnosis (≤90–180 days).
- Extremely high presenting leukocyte count (≥200,000–300,000/μL).
- Poor early response, as reflected by a poor response to a prednisone prophase or high levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction and consolidation phases of treatment.

In one report, any CNS involvement at diagnosis (CNS2, CNS3, or traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts) was also found to be an independent predictor of adverse outcome in infants with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL.[[31](#cit/section_9.31)]

In addition to having a significantly higher relapse rate than older children with ALL, infant patients more frequently present with a higher acuity. In a large retrospective study, infants with ALL were more likely to present with multisystem organ failure than noninfants (12% and 1%). Infants also had greater requirements for blood products, diuretics, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilation during induction, compared with noninfants.[[32](#cit/section_9.32)]

Infants are also at higher risk of developing treatment-related toxicity, especially infection. With current treatment approaches for this population, treatment-related mortality has been reported to occur in about 10% of infants, a rate that is much higher than the rate in older children with ALL.[[23](#cit/section_9.23),[24](#cit/section_9.24)] On the COG [AALL0631 (NCT00557193)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00557193) trial, an intensified induction regimen resulted in an induction death rate of 15.4% (4 of 26 patients). The trial was subsequently amended to include a less-intensive induction and enhanced supportive care guidelines, resulting in a significantly lower induction death rate (1.6%; 2 of 123 patients) and significantly higher CR rate (94% vs. 68% with the previous, more intensified induction regimen).[[33](#cit/section_9.33)]

#### Treatment options for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements

Infants with *KMT2A* gene rearrangements are generally treated on intensified chemotherapy regimens using agents not typically incorporated into frontline therapy for older children with ALL. However, despite these intensified approaches, EFS rates remain poor for these patients.

Evidence (intensified chemotherapy regimens for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements):

1. The international Interfant-99 trial used a cytarabine-intensive chemotherapy regimen, with increased exposure to both low- and high-dose cytarabine during the first few months of therapy.[[23](#cit/section_9.23)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 37% for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements.
2. The COG tested intensification of therapy with a regimen that included multiple doses of high-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide.[[22](#cit/section_9.22)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 34% for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements.
3. On the COG [P9407 (NCT00002756)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002756) trial, infants were treated with a shortened (46-week) intensive chemotherapy regimen.[[24](#cit/section_9.24)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 36% for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements.
4. The international Interfant-06 study tested whether acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-style consolidation chemotherapy was superior to ALL-style chemotherapy.[[30](#cit/section_9.30)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The 6-year EFS rate was 46.1%, and the OS rate was 58.2%. These rates were not statistically different from the rates observed in the predecessor Interfant-99 protocol.
- For infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements, the 6-year EFS rate was 36.4%, with no significant difference between the AML and ALL approach.
- In a subsequent analysis of the subset of *KMT2A*-rearranged patients in whom MRD was evaluated, both end-of-induction (EOI) and end-of-consolidation (EOC) MRD were strongly predictive of outcome. Patients who were EOI MRD positive, but became EOC MRD negative, had similar outcomes to those who were EOI MRD negative (6-year DFS rates, 65.7% and 72.0%, respectively). Patients with high EOC MRD had dismal outcomes (6-year DFS rate, 13.1%). Patients with negative EOI MRD had a higher 6-year DFS rate when treated with the ALL approach (78.2%) than did patients who were treated with the AML approach (45%). However, patients with high EOI MRD (≥5 × 10-4) who were treated with an AML approach had a superior 6-year DFS rate (45.9%) when compared with patients who were treated with the ALL approach (23.2%).[[34](#cit/section_9.34)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
5. In a follow-up pilot trial conducted by the Interfant study group, 30 infants with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL were treated using the Interfant-06 chemotherapy backbone, with the addition of one 28-day course of blinatumomab after the induction phase.[[35](#cit/section_9.35)]

- Blinatumomab was well tolerated, without any excessive or unexpected toxicity in these infant patients.
- With short median follow-up (26.3 months), the 2-year DFS rate was 81.6% (95% CI, 60.8%–92.0%), and the 2-year OS rate was 93.3% (95% CI, 75.9%–98.3%).
- These outcomes were superior to the 2-year DFS and OS rates of historical controls who were treated in the Interfant-06 protocol (DFS and OS rates, 49.4% and 65.8%, respectively).
6. On the MLL-10 trial conducted by the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG), infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements were treated with an intensified chemotherapy backbone that included multiple phases using high-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine. Patients classified as high-risk on the basis of age and CNS status (75% of *KMT2A*-rearranged patients) were allocated to HSCT in first CR.[[25](#cit/section_9.25)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 66%, and the 5-year OS rate was 82%.
7. In the COG [AALL0631 (NCT00557193)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00557193) trial, infants with *KMT2A*-rearranged ALL were assigned to receive an intensive chemotherapy regimen with or without lestaurtinib, an FLT3 inhibitor (administered during postinduction treatment phases).[[28](#cit/section_9.28)]

- The overall 5-year EFS rate for all participants was 34%, and the 5-year OS rate was 41%.
- There was no difference in outcome between patients on the lestaurtinib arm versus those who received chemotherapy only.

Exploratory studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of sufficient lestaurtinib blood levels to achieve FLT3 inhibition and to evaluate the impact of ex vivo sensitivity of leukemia cells to lestaurtinib.

- Only 38% of lestaurtinib-treated patients demonstrated in vivo FLT3 inhibition. This subset of patients appeared to have a better outcome than other patients on the lestaurtinib arm, as did those whose blasts demonstrated ex vivo sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition.

The role of allogeneic HSCT during first remission in infants with *KMT2A* gene rearrangements remains controversial.

Evidence (allogeneic HSCT in first remission for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements):

1. On a trial conducted by the JPLSG between 1998 and 2002, all infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements were intended to proceed to allogeneic HSCT from the best available donor (related, unrelated, or umbilical cord) 3 to 5 months after diagnosis.[[36](#cit/section_9.36)]

- The 3-year EFS rate for all enrolled infants was 44%. This outcome resulted, in part, from the high frequency of early relapses, even with intensive chemotherapy. Of the 41 infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements on that study who achieved CR, 11 infants (27%) relapsed before proceeding to transplant.
2. In a follow-up trial conducted by the JPLSG between 2011 and 2015, allocation to HSCT in first CR was restricted to the patients with *KMT2A* rearrangements and classified as high risk (age <6 months and/or CNS3 status at diagnosis).[[25](#cit/section_9.25)]

- Of the 56 patients that were classified as high risk (75% of all *KMT2A*-rearranged patients enrolled on the trial), 49 achieved CR, and 38 underwent HSCT.
- In an intent-to-treat analysis of all high-risk patients enrolled on the trial, the 5-year EFS rate was 56.6%.
- For the subset of patients who also met Interfant-06 criteria for high risk (age <6 months and WBC >300,000/µL or a prednisolone poor responder), the 5-year EFS rate was 45.2%.
3. In a COG report that included 189 infants treated on CCG or POG infant ALL protocols between 1996 and 2000, there was no difference in EFS between patients who underwent HSCT in first CR and those who received chemotherapy alone.[[37](#cit/section_9.37)]
4. The Interfant clinical trials group, after adjusting for waiting time to transplant, also did not observe any difference in DFS in high-risk infants (defined by prednisone response) with *KMT2A* rearrangements treated on the Interfant-99 trial with either allogeneic HSCT in first CR or chemotherapy alone.[[23](#cit/section_9.23)]

- In a subset analysis from the same trial, allogeneic HSCT in first remission was associated with a significantly better DFS for infants with *KMT2A* rearrangements who were younger than 6 months at diagnosis and had either a poor prednisone response at day 8 or leukocyte counts of at least 300,000/µL.[[38](#cit/section_9.38)] In this subset, HSCT in first remission was associated with a 64% reduction in the risk of failure resulting from relapse or death compared with chemotherapy alone.
5. On the Interfant-06 study, infants considered to be high risk (all of the following: *KMT2A* rearrangements, age <6 months, and WBC ≥300,000/μL) were considered eligible for allogeneic HSCT in first CR.[[30](#cit/section_9.30)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- About one-half of the high-risk patients did not proceed to transplant in the first CR primarily because of early relapse.
- The 6-year EFS rate of the entire high-risk group was 21%.
- For the highly-selected population who underwent HSCT, the 4-year DFS rate was 44%.

For infants with ALL who undergo transplant in first CR, outcomes appear to be similar with non–total-body irradiation (TBI) regimens and TBI-based regimens.[[37](#cit/section_9.37),[39](#cit/section_9.39)]

#### Treatment options for infants without *KMT2A* rearrangements

The optimal treatment for infants without *KMT2A* rearrangements also remains unclear, in part because of the paucity of data on the use of standard ALL regimens used in older children.

1. On the Interfant-99 trial, patients without *KMT2A* rearrangements achieved a relatively favorable outcome with the cytarabine-intensive treatment regimen (4-year EFS rate, 74%).[[23](#cit/section_9.23)]
2. The COG [P9407 (NCT00002756)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002756) trial of intensified chemotherapy reported a 5-year EFS rate of 70% in infants without the *KMT2A* rearrangement.[[24](#cit/section_9.24)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
3. A favorable outcome for this subset of patients was obtained in a Japanese study using therapy comparable to that used to treat older children with ALL.[[27](#cit/section_9.27)] However, that study was limited by small numbers (n = 22) and a highly unusual sex distribution (91% males).
4. On the Interfant-06 study, the 6-year EFS rate for infants without *KMT2A* rearrangements was 73.9%, and the OS rate was 87.2%.[[40](#cit/section_9.40)]; [[30](#cit/section_9.30)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
5. On the COG [AALL0631 (NCT00557193)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00557193) study, infants without *KMT2A* rearrangements received the same intensified chemotherapy backbone as those with the *KMT2A* rearrangement.[[41](#cit/section_9.41)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 87.3% (± 4.7%), and the 5-year OS rate was 93.6% (± 3.5%) for 64 infants without *KMT2A* rearrangements.

### Adolescents and Young Adults With ALL

Adolescents and young adults with ALL have been recognized as high risk for decades. Outcomes for this age group are inferior in almost all studies of treatment compared with children younger than 10 years.[[42](#cit/section_9.42)-[44](#cit/section_9.44)] The reasons for this difference include more frequent presentation of adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis, including the following:

- T-cell immunophenotype.
- *BCR*::*ABL1* and *BCR*::*ABL1*-like disease.
- Lower incidence of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities.

In addition to more frequent adverse prognostic factors, patients in this age group have higher rates of treatment-related mortality [[43](#cit/section_9.43)-[46](#cit/section_9.46)] and nonadherence to therapy.[[45](#cit/section_9.45),[47](#cit/section_9.47)]

#### Treatment options for adolescents and young adults with ALL

Studies from the United States and France were among the first to identify the difference in outcome based on treatment regimens.[[48](#cit/section_9.48)] Other studies have confirmed that older adolescent and young adult patients fare better on pediatric rather than adult regimens.[[48](#cit/section_9.48)-[56](#cit/section_9.56)]; [[57](#cit/section_9.57)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] These study results are summarized in [Table 12](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1429).

Given the relatively favorable outcome that can be obtained in these patients with chemotherapy regimens used for high-risk pediatric ALL, there is no role for the routine use of allogeneic HSCT for adolescents and young adults with ALL in first remission.[[44](#cit/section_9.44)]

Evidence (use of a pediatric treatment regimen for adolescents and young adults with ALL):

1. The [CALGB-10403 (NCT00558519)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00558519) trial prospectively studied the feasibility and efficacy of using a pediatric treatment regimen (administered by medical oncologists) for adolescent and young adult patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Of the 318 patients enrolled, 295 were eligible and evaluable for response. The median age was 24 years (range, 17–39 years).[[56](#cit/section_9.56),[58](#cit/section_9.58)]

- Use of the pediatric regimen (from the COG [AALL0232](/clinicaltrials/NCT00075725) study, which included interim maintenance phases with escalating doses of methotrexate without leucovorin followed by asparaginase) was deemed safe, and the overall treatment-related mortality was 3%.
- The median EFS was 78.1 months, which is more than double the historical control of 30 months. The 3-year EFS rate was 59%, and the median OS was not reached. The estimated 3-year OS rate was 73%.
- Pretreatment risk factors associated with a worse outcome were obesity and the presence of the *BCR*::*ABL1*-like expression signature. Of the evaluable patients, 31% had a *BCR*::*ABL1*-like signature. These patients had a significantly worse outcome, with a 3-year EFS rate of 42%, compared with an EFS rate of 69% for patients without *BCR*::*ABL1*-like ALL (hazard ratio, 2.06; log-rank *P* = .008).
- End-induction MRD was a significant predictor of outcome. In the subset of patients evaluable for MRD, 44% had absence of detectable end-induction MRD using an Ig-TCR PCR-MRD assay (sensitivity of detection of 1 in 104 to 105). These patients had a 3-year DFS rate of 85%, compared with a 3-year DFS rate of 54% for those with detectable end-induction MRD (*P* = .001).
- In a study of patients aged 16 to 39 years, the outcomes of those who received postremission, standard, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy per the CALGB-10403 protocol were compared with the outcomes of patients who received myeloablative allogeneic HSCT. Patients who received chemotherapy had superior OS, DFS, and nonrelapse mortality rates.[[59](#cit/section_9.59)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
2. Investigators reported on 197 patients aged 16 to 21 years treated on the CCG study (a pediatric ALL regimen) compared with 124 adolescents and young adults treated on the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study (an adult ALL regimen).[[48](#cit/section_9.48)]

- For the patients treated with a pediatric ALL regimen, the 7-year EFS rate was 63%.
- For the patients treated with an adult ALL regimen, the 7-year EFS rate was 34%.
3. In a Canadian population-based cohort study, the effect of adapting pediatric protocols for adolescent and young adult patients with ALL was determined over a 20-year period.[[60](#cit/section_9.60)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 72% for adolescent and young adult patients treated at pediatric centers, compared with 56% for adolescent and young adult patients treated at adult centers (*P* = .03).
- In the most recent period (2006–2011), the outcome of adolescent and young adult patients treated at adult centers with pediatric protocols was superior to those treated with adult protocols (EFS rate, 72% vs. 60%), but inferior to adolescent and young adult patients treated at pediatric centers (EFS rate, 81%; *P* = .02).
- The authors conclude that besides protocol therapy, there may be other differences between adult and pediatric centers that may explain the disparate outcomes.

The reason that adolescents and young adults achieve superior outcomes with pediatric regimens is not known, although possible explanations include the following:[[49](#cit/section_9.49)]

- Treatment setting (i.e., site experience in treating ALL).
- Adherence to protocol therapy.[[47](#cit/section_9.47)]
- The
components of protocol therapy.

##### Osteonecrosis

Adolescents with ALL appear to be at higher risk than younger children for developing therapy-related complications, including osteonecrosis, deep venous thromboses, and pancreatitis.[[50](#cit/section_9.50),[65](#cit/section_9.65),[66](#cit/section_9.66)] Before the use of postinduction intensification for treatment of ALL, osteonecrosis was infrequent. The improvement in outcome for children and adolescents aged 10 years and older was accompanied by an increased incidence of osteonecrosis.

The weight-bearing joints are affected in 95% of patients who develop osteonecrosis and operative interventions were needed for management of symptoms and impaired mobility in more than 40% of cases. Most cases are diagnosed within the first 2 years of therapy and the symptoms are often recognized during maintenance.

Evidence (osteonecrosis):

1. In the [CCG-1961](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002812) high-risk ALL study, alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone was compared with standard continuous dexamethasone during delayed intensification to determine whether the osteonecrosis risk could be reduced.[[65](#cit/section_9.65)]

- The median age at symptom onset was 16 years.
- The cumulative incidence was higher in adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 21 years (20% at 5 years) than in those aged 10 to 15 years (9.9%) or in patients aged 1 to 9 years (1%).
- Operative interventions were needed for management of symptoms and impaired mobility in more than 40% of cases.
- The use of alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone as compared with standard continuous dexamethasone during delayed intensification in CCG-1961 reduced the risk of osteonecrosis. The greatest impact was seen in females aged 16 to 21 years, who showed the highest incidence of osteonecrosis with standard therapy containing continuous dexamethasone; osteonecrosis was reduced with alternate-week dexamethasone postinduction (57.6% to 5.6%).
2. In the COG [AALL0232 (NCT00075725)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00075725) high-risk ALL trial, patients were randomly assigned during induction to receive either 14 days of dexamethasone or 28 days of prednisone.[[67](#cit/section_9.67)]

- The incidence of osteonecrosis in patients older than 10 years who received dexamethasone was 24.3%, compared with an incidence of 15.9% in those who received prednisone (*P* = .001).
- For patients aged 10 years and older, there was no difference in outcome between arms by corticosteroid (5-year EFS rate, 73.1% on the dexamethasone arm and 73.9% on the prednisone arm; *P* = .78).
- However, among all patients in the analysis cohort, patients with osteonecrosis had superior 5-year EFS and OS rates than patients without osteonecrosis (EFS rates, 89.8% vs. 77.8%, *P* < .0001; OS rates, 95.8% vs. 86.1%, *P* < .0001).[[68](#cit/section_9.68)] Similar differences were seen in patients older than 10 years. Improved survival was directly attributed to reduced relapse rates.

### Children With Down Syndrome

Approximately 2% to 3% of childhood ALL cases occur in children with Down syndrome.[[69](#cit/section_9.69)-[72](#cit/section_9.72)] ALL in pediatric patients with Down syndrome is characterized by a lower incidence of both favorable (e.g., *ETV6*::*RUNX1* and high hyperdiploidy with favorable trisomies) and unfavorable (e.g., *BCR*::*ABL1*, *KMT2A* rearrangements, low hypodiploidy, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) or t(4;11)(q21;q23)) biology and a near absence of T-cell phenotype.[[69](#cit/section_9.69)-[71](#cit/section_9.71),[73](#cit/section_9.73),[74](#cit/section_9.74)]

Certain genomic abnormalities, such as *IKZF1* deletions, *CRLF2* aberrations, and *JAK* variants, are seen more frequently in ALL arising in children with Down syndrome than in those without Down syndrome.[[75](#cit/section_9.75)-[79](#cit/section_9.79)] Studies of children with Down syndrome and ALL suggest that the presence of *IKZF1* deletions (but not *CRLF2* aberrations or *JAK* variants) is associated with an inferior prognosis.[[74](#cit/section_9.74),[79](#cit/section_9.79),[80](#cit/section_9.80)]

Patients with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing toxicities from treatment, including infections, mucositis, and seizures. In some studies, outcomes of children with Down syndrome and ALL have been reported to be inferior,[[69](#cit/section_9.69),[70](#cit/section_9.70),[81](#cit/section_9.81)-[83](#cit/section_9.83)] although in other studies, patients with Down syndrome appeared to fare as well as those without Down syndrome.[[84](#cit/section_9.84),[85](#cit/section_9.85)] Inferior outcomes for patients with Down syndrome, when observed, are related to both an increased risk of relapse, as well as increased frequency of treatment-related mortality.[[69](#cit/section_9.69)-[71](#cit/section_9.71),[74](#cit/section_9.74),[81](#cit/section_9.81),[82](#cit/section_9.82)]

Because of the well-established increase in toxicity experienced by patients with Down syndrome, some ALL protocols (such as those of the COG) have de-intensified risk-based treatment for patients with Down syndrome and ALL to minimize exposure to the morbid components of therapy. While this treatment reduction strategy reduces the frequency and severity of toxicities, its impact on antileukemic outcomes is not yet known.

#### Treatment of children with Down syndrome

Evidence (toxicity and outcome of patients with Down syndrome and ALL):

1. A large retrospective study that included 653 patients with Down syndrome and ALL who were treated between 1995 to 2004 reported the following results:[[74](#cit/section_9.74)]

- Patients with Down syndrome had lower CR rates (97% vs. 99%, *P* < .001), higher cumulative incidence of relapse rates (26% vs. 15%, *P* < .001), and higher treatment-related mortality rates (7.7% vs. 2.3%, *P* < .001), compared with patients without Down syndrome.
- For patients with Down syndrome and ALL, treatment-related mortality occurred at a higher rate during all phases of therapy, including maintenance. The rates of treatment-related mortality during induction were 2.8% and 4.9% during the remaining treatment phases after CR had been achieved. The most common cause of treatment-related mortality was infection.
- Among the patients with Down syndrome, age younger than 6 years, WBC count of less than 10,000/μL, and the presence of the *ETV6*::*RUNX1* fusion (observed in 8% of patients) were independent predictors of favorable EFS.
2. In a report of 2,811 children with ALL enrolled on the COG P9900 classification study, 80 patients (3%) had Down syndrome. Age, sex, WBC count, and risk group were similar between patients with and without Down syndrome, but a lower percentage of patients with Down syndrome had *ETV6*::*RUNX1* (2.5% vs. 24%, *P* < .001) or trisomies 4 and 10 (7.7% vs. 24%, *P* < .001).[[71](#cit/section_9.71)]

- The 5-year EFS and OS rates were inferior in children with Down syndrome: 69.9% versus 78.1% (*P* = .078), and 85.8% versus 90.0% (*P* = .033), respectively.
- However, when children with *KMT2A* rearrangements, *BCR*::*ABL1*, *ETV6*::*RUNX1*, and trisomies 4 and 10 were excluded from the analysis, the EFS and OS rates were similar for children with and without Down syndrome (EFS rates, 68.0% [± 9.3%] vs. 70.5% [± 1.9%], *P* = .817; OS rates, 86.7% [± 6.7%] vs. 85.4% [± 1.5%]; *P* = .852).
3. In the [CCG-1991 (NCT00005945)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00005945) study for children with standard-risk B-ALL (2000–2005), patients (including those with Down syndrome) were randomly assigned to receive an interim maintenance phase consisting of either escalating doses of intravenous methotrexate without leucovorin rescue or standard low-dose oral methotrexate given with vincristine, dexamethasone, and mercaptopurine.[[85](#cit/section_9.85)]

- The 10-year EFS rates were 94.4% (± 5.4%) for patients with Down syndrome randomly assigned to receive escalating-dose IV methotrexate (N = 31), versus 81.5% (± 6.6%) for patients who received oral low-dose methotrexate (N = 44).
- The mean total tolerated dose of methotrexate on the escalating IV arm was lower in patients with Down syndrome than patients without Down syndrome.
- The incidence of mucositis was increased in patients with Down syndrome who received escalating-dose methotrexate, compared with patients without Down syndrome, but there was no increase in hepatic toxicity, infections, or treatment-related deaths.
4. On DFCI ALL Consortium protocols, children with Down syndrome receive the same risk-stratified therapy as other patients, without any dose reductions or modifications. An analysis of two consecutive trials conducted between 2000 to 2011 found the following:[[84](#cit/section_9.84)]

- The 5-year EFS and OS rates of patients with Down syndrome (N = 38) were similar to that of patients without Down syndrome (N = 1,248) (EFS rates, 91% vs. 84%; OS rates, 97% vs. 91%).
- All patients with Down syndrome achieved complete remission, and none of the patients experienced treatment-related mortality.
- Patients with Down syndrome had significantly higher rates of mucositis (52% vs. 12%, *P* < .001), non-CNS thrombosis (18% vs. 8%; *P* = .036), and seizure (16% vs. 5%, *P* = .010). Patients with Down syndrome also had a higher incidence of infections during all therapy phases.

### *BCR*::*ABL1*-Positive (Philadelphia Chromosome–Positive) ALL

*BCR*::*ABL1*-positive (Philadelphia chromosome–positive [Ph+]) ALL is seen in about 3% of pediatric ALL cases, increases in adolescence, and is seen in 15% to 25% of adults. In the past, this subtype of ALL has been recognized as extremely difficult to treat, and patients had a poor outcome. In 2000, an international pediatric leukemia group reported a 7-year EFS rate of 25%, with an OS rate of 36%.[[86](#cit/section_9.86)] In 2010, the same group reported a 7-year EFS rate of 31% and an OS rate of 44% in patients with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL treated without tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).[[87](#cit/section_9.87)] Treatment of this subgroup has evolved, from an initial emphasis on aggressive chemotherapy, to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR) as the standard of care, and currently to combination therapy using chemotherapy plus a TKI, with only a small number of patients allocated to allogeneic HSCT in first CR.

For patients with ALL and *BCR*::*ABL1* gene fusions, MRD detection based on flow cytometry or detection of immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor (IG/TCR) rearrangements by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides more reliable prognostication than methods based on quantification of *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion transcripts or DNA.[[88](#cit/section_9.88)-[90](#cit/section_9.90)] In some cases, *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion transcripts or DNA may persist in the absence of detectable MRD by flow cytometry or assays of IG/TCR rearrangements. This pattern is characteristic of *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive ALL with multilineage involvement. The multilineage subtype is distinguished from the more common subtype, *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive ALL with lymphoid-only involvement, in that the *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion can be found in normal non-ALL B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells, as opposed to just lymphoblasts.[[91](#cit/section_9.91),[92](#cit/section_9.92)] The persistence of *BCR*::*ABL1* fusion DNA or RNA in *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive ALL with multilineage involvement likely represents evidence of a residual preleukemic clone and not leukemia cells. Therefore, the term MRD is a misnomer. Based on the limited numbers of patients studied to date, prognosis appears similar in both adults and children with lymphoid-only versus multilineage involvement *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive ALL.[[88](#cit/section_9.88),[89](#cit/section_9.89)] In addition, it does not appear that persistence of *BCR*::*ABL1* PCR positivity (in the absence of detectable MRD by other assays) has prognostic implication. Thus, for *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive ALL, flow cytometry and/or IG/TCR PCR or NGS assays are more reliable methods than *BCR*::*ABL1* PCR to assess MRD for risk stratification and treatment decisions. For more information, see the [Cytogenetics/Genomics of Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2077) section.

#### Treatment options for patients with *BCR*::*ABL1*-positive ALL

Standard therapy for patients with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL includes the use of a TKI (e.g., imatinib or dasatinib) in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, with or without allogeneic HSCT in first CR.

Imatinib mesylate is a selective inhibitor of the BCR::ABL1 protein kinase. Phase I and phase II studies of single-agent imatinib in children and adults with relapsed or refractory *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL have demonstrated relatively high response rates, although these responses tended to be of short duration.[[93](#cit/section_9.93),[94](#cit/section_9.94)]

Clinical trials in adults and children with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL have demonstrated the feasibility of administering imatinib mesylate in combination with multiagent chemotherapy.[[95](#cit/section_9.95)-[97](#cit/section_9.97)] Patients with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL demonstrated a better outcome after HSCT if imatinib was given before or after transplant.[[98](#cit/section_9.98)-[102](#cit/section_9.102)] Clinical trials have also demonstrated that many pediatric patients with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL have a comparable EFS using chemotherapy and a TKI rather than transplant.[[102](#cit/section_9.102),[103](#cit/section_9.103)]

Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, has also been studied in the treatment of *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL. Dasatinib has shown significant activity in the CNS, both in a mouse model and a series of patients with CNS-positive leukemia.[[104](#cit/section_9.104)] The results of a phase I trial of dasatinib in pediatric patients indicated that once-daily dosing was associated with an acceptable toxicity profile, with few nonhematologic grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events.[[105](#cit/section_9.105)]

Evidence (TKI):

1. The [COG-AALL0031](/clinicaltrials/NCT00022737) study evaluated whether imatinib mesylate could be incorporated into an intensive chemotherapy regimen for children with *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL. Patients received imatinib mesylate in conjunction with chemotherapy during postinduction therapy. Some children proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with imatinib mesylate, while other patients received imatinib mesylate in combination with chemotherapy throughout all treatment phases.[[97](#cit/section_9.97),[102](#cit/section_9.102)]

- The 5-year DFS rate for the 25 patients who received intensive chemotherapy with continuous dosing of imatinib mesylate was 70% (± 12%). These patients fared better than historical controls who were treated with chemotherapy alone (without imatinib mesylate), and at least as well as the other patients on the trial who underwent allogeneic transplant. The 5-year DFS rate was 66% for patients who underwent sibling-donor transplant (n = 21) and 59% for those who underwent unrelated donor transplant (n = 13).
- Patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities had worse outcomes (*P* = .05).
2. The [COG-AALL0622 (NCT00720109)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00720109) study tested the use of dasatinib (instead of imatinib) combined with a chemotherapy backbone similar to that used in the COG-AALL0031 trial.[[106](#cit/section_9.106)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] On this trial, dasatinib was started on day 15 of induction, while on the AALL0031 trial, imatinib was started postinduction.

- Introduction of a TKI during induction on the AALL0631 trial resulted in better early response compared with the AALL0031 trial (no TKI during induction). The end-induction (day 29) CR rate was 98% (n = 59) on the AALL0622 trial, compared with 89% (n = 91) on the AALL0031 trial (*P* = .01), and rates of low end-induction MRD (<0.01%) were superior on the AALL0622 trial compared with the AALL0031 trial (59% vs. 25%; *P* < .001).
- Outcomes in the two trials were similar: the 5-year OS rates were 81% and 86%, and the 5-year DFS rates were 68% and 60% for AALL0031 and AALL0622, respectively.
- Excessive toxicity with dasatinib was not observed.
- In a subset analysis that included patients who had diagnostic banked samples available, the *IKZF1* deletion was identified in 57% of patients and was associated with inferior EFS and OS.
3. The EsPhALL2004 trial tested whether imatinib (administered discontinuously) given in the context of intensive chemotherapy improved outcome for pediatric *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL patients, most of whom (80%) received an allogeneic HSCT in first CR. Patients were classified as either good risk or poor risk on the basis of early response measures and remission status at the end of induction. Good-risk patients (n = 90) were randomly assigned to receive imatinib or no imatinib; poor-risk patients (n = 70) were directly assigned to treatment with imatinib. Interpretation of this study is limited because of the high noncompliance rate with randomized assignment in good-risk patients and early closure before reaching goal accrual because of the publication of the results of the COG AALL0031 trial on which imatinib had been given continuously with chemotherapy.[[103](#cit/section_9.103)]

- The overall DFS of patients treated on this trial appeared to be better than historical controls, and when analyzed as-treated (and not by intent-to-treat), good-risk patients who received imatinib had a superior DFS (4-year DFS rate was 75% for patients who received imatinib and 56% for patients who did not receive imatinib).[[107](#cit/section_9.107)]
4. The subsequent [EsPhALL2010 (NCT00287105)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00287105) trial was a result of an amendment to the 2004 trial, which included earlier initiation of imatinib therapy at day 15 of induction and continuous dosing of imatinib until the end of therapy or 1 year after transplant. A subsequent amendment in the trial also changed the indication for HSCT in first CR to only the poor-risk patients.[[108](#cit/section_9.108)]

- Earlier introduction of imatinib (during induction) resulted in an increased rate of CR to 97% at the end of induction (from 78% in the previous trial) and fewer patients being allocated to HSCT (38% on amended trial vs. 81% on initial trial).
- The EFS and OS rates were similar between the amended trial and the initial trial, even though significantly fewer patients received HSCT in first CR on the amended trial.
- The EsPhALL chemotherapy backbone combined with continuous dosing of imatinib was associated with a high rate of toxicity (primarily infections) and treatment-related mortality.
5. The [CA180-372/COG AALL1122 (NCT01460160)](/clinicaltrials/NCT01460160) study was a joint COG and European intergroup single-arm, phase II trial that tested the combination of dasatinib and the EsPhALL chemotherapy backbone for patients with newly diagnosed *BCR*::*ABL1*–positive ALL. Dasatinib was given starting at day 15 of induction therapy, and only CNS3 patients or those allocated to HSCT received cranial radiation. Nineteen of 109 patients (18%) were considered high risk based on high time point 2 (end-induction IB) MRD or detectable MRD (any level) after three consolidation blocks of chemotherapy. All other patients were considered standard risk (82%). Fifteen patients (14%), all assigned to the high-risk group, underwent HSCT in first CR. All remaining patients were allocated to receive 2 years of chemotherapy with dasatinib.[[90](#cit/section_9.90)]

- The 5-year EFS rate was 54.6%, and the 5-year OS rate was 91.5%, indicating a high rate of salvageability after relapse.
- For patients with standard-risk ALL, the 5-year EFS rate was 52.1%, and the OS rate was 82.3%.
- For patients with high-risk ALL, the 5-year EFS rate was 56.8%, and the OS rate was 78.2%.
- The 3-year EFS rate on the AALL1122 trial (65.5%) was statistically noninferior to that of the EsPhALL 2010 trial (59.1%), on which patients received imatinib combined with the same chemotherapy backbone. However, fewer patients on the AALL1122 trial underwent HSCT in first CR, compared with the EsPhALL 2010 trial (14% vs. 38%). Fewer patients on the AALL1122 trial received cranial radiation (15% vs. 100%).
- Frequency of infections were high (grade 3 or higher sepsis, 34%; grade 3 or higher fungal infection, 14%), and the treatment-related mortality rate was 8% (8% in those receiving chemotherapy with dasatinib, 13% in those undergoing HSCT in first CR).
- MRD on this trial was assessed by three methodologies: IG/TCR PCR, flow cytometry, and *BCR*::*ABL1* PCR. Concordance between assays was highest for IG/TCR PCR and flow cytometry, while *BCR*::*ABL1* PCR results were more frequently discordant. The *BCR*::*ABL1* PCR assay more often demonstrated persistent positivity when the other assays yielded nondetectable results. The outcome of patients who continued to have detectable *BCR*::*ABL1* PCR results, but were MRD negative by the other two assays, was similar to that of patients with nondetectable results by all three assays.
6. The Chinese Children’s Cancer Group ALL-2015 trial randomly assigned 189 patients to receive either dasatinib or imatinib combined with a multiagent regimen based on SJCRH ALL protocols. On this trial, dasatinib was administered at a higher dose (80 mg/m2 instead of 60 mg/m2) and imatinib was administered at a lower dose (300 mg/m2 instead of 340 mg/m2) than they were administered on previous pediatric *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL trials conducted by COG and EsPhALL.[[109](#cit/section_9.109)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- With a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the 4-year EFS and OS rates were 71% and 88.4%, respectively, for patients randomly assigned to receive dasatinib, compared with 48.9% and 69.2%, respectively, for patients randomly assigned to receive imatinib.
- Toxicity was similar between the two treatment arms.
- Caution is needed in interpreting these results because of the short median follow-up time and because the outcomes of patients who received imatinib on this trial were inferior to the outcomes of imatinib-treated patients reported in previous trials.

## Treatment of Relapsed Childhood ALL

### Prognostic Factors After First Relapse of Childhood ALL

The prognosis for a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) whose disease
recurs depends on multiple factors.[[1](#cit/section_10.1)-[15](#cit/section_10.15)]; [[16](#cit/section_10.16)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

The following two important risk factors after first relapse of childhood ALL are key to determining prognosis and treatment approach:

- [Site of relapse](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1394).
- [Time from diagnosis to relapse](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1393).

Other prognostic factors include the following:

- [Patient characteristics](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1392) (e.g., age and peripheral blast count at time of relapse).
- [Risk group classification at initial diagnosis](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1490).
- [Response to reinduction therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1488).
- [Cytogenetics/genomic alterations](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1395).
- [Immunophenotype](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1396).

#### Site of relapse

Patients who have isolated extramedullary relapse generally fare better than those who have relapse involving the marrow. In some studies, patients with combined marrow/extramedullary relapse had a better prognosis than did those with a marrow only relapse. However, other studies have not confirmed this finding.[[5](#cit/section_10.5),[13](#cit/section_10.13),[17](#cit/section_10.17)] In one study by the Children's Oncology Group (COG), there was no difference in postrelapse survival between isolated marrow and combined marrow/extramedullary relapses in T-ALL or infant B-ALL. However, for noninfant patients with B-ALL, combined relapses were associated with a better outcome, compared with isolated marrow relapses.[[15](#cit/section_10.15)]

#### Time from diagnosis to relapse

In general, patients whose relapses occur earlier after initial diagnosis fare worse than those who experience later relapses.[[15](#cit/section_10.15)] For example, survival rates for patients with relapsed B-ALL range from less than 20% for patients with marrow relapses occurring within 18 months from diagnosis to higher than 60% for those whose relapses occur more than 36 months from diagnosis.[[5](#cit/section_10.5),[13](#cit/section_10.13),[18](#cit/section_10.18)]

For patients with isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapses, the overall survival (OS) rates are 40% to 50% for early relapse (<18 months from diagnosis) and 75% to 80% for those with late relapses (>18 months from diagnosis).[[13](#cit/section_10.13),[19](#cit/section_10.19)] No evidence exists that early detection of relapse by frequent surveillance (complete blood counts or bone marrow tests) in off-therapy patients improves outcome.[[20](#cit/section_10.20)]

#### Patient characteristics

Age 10 years and older at initial diagnosis and at relapse have been reported as independent predictors of poor outcome.[[13](#cit/section_10.13),[17](#cit/section_10.17)] A COG study demonstrated that patients aged 10 to 15 years at initial diagnosis had inferior outcomes compared with patients aged 1 to 9 years (5-year postrelapse survival rate, 36% vs. 58%), and those older than age 15 years did even worse (5-year OS rate, 29%).[[15](#cit/section_10.15)]

In a study from the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) group that included patients with B-ALL who were diagnosed at age 18 years or younger and experienced a late relapse, age at initial diagnosis was not a significant predictor of subsequent outcome when analyzed by quartiles. However, the outcome for patients aged 18 years and older at time of relapse was significantly inferior to the outcome for patients relapsing at age younger than 18 years (39.5% vs. 68.7%; *P* = .0001).[[21](#cit/section_10.21)]

The BFM group has also reported that high peripheral blast counts (>10,000/μL) at the time of relapse were associated with inferior outcomes in patients with late marrow relapses.[[10](#cit/section_10.10)]

Children with Down syndrome and ALL who relapse have generally had inferior outcomes resulting from increased induction deaths, treatment-related mortality, and relapse.

- The BFM group showed that since 2000, improvements in supportive care have led to decreases in treatment-related mortality in children with Down syndrome, but the risk of relapse remains high.[[22](#cit/section_10.22)]
- An analysis of data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) on 27 patients with Down syndrome and ALL who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) between 2000 and 2009 substantiated this finding. They noted that with current transplant practices, hematopoietic recovery, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplant-related mortality were within the expected range compared with patients without Down syndrome. However, relapse was higher than expected (>50%) and was the primary cause of treatment failure, leading to poor survival (disease-free survival [DFS] rate at 3 years, 24%).[[23](#cit/section_10.23)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

#### Risk group classification at initial diagnosis

The COG reported that risk group classification at the time of initial diagnosis was prognostically significant after relapse. Patients with B-ALL who met National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard-risk criteria at initial diagnosis fared better after relapse than did NCI high-risk patients.[[15](#cit/section_10.15)]

#### Response to reinduction therapy

Patients with marrow relapses who have persistent morphological disease at the end of the first month of reinduction therapy have an extremely poor prognosis, even if they subsequently achieve a second complete remission (CR).[[24](#cit/section_10.24)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[25](#cit/section_10.25)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Several studies have demonstrated that minimal residual disease (MRD) levels after the achievement of second CR are of prognostic significance in relapsed ALL.[[21](#cit/section_10.21),[24](#cit/section_10.24),[26](#cit/section_10.26)-[29](#cit/section_10.29)]; [[30](#cit/section_10.30),[31](#cit/section_10.31)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] High levels of MRD at the end of reinduction and at later time points have been correlated with an extremely high risk of subsequent relapse.[[21](#cit/section_10.21),[29](#cit/section_10.29)]

#### Cytogenetics/genomic alterations

Cytogenetic aberrations have been shown to be significant prognostic factors in B-ALL.

- In a study of 2,053 patients with ALL initially treated in COG studies who subsequently experienced a relapse, several recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities were significant predictors of OS. Patients with either *ETV6*::*RUNX1* gene fusions or high hyperdiploidy with trisomies 4 and 10 had a longer median time to first relapse (43 months) and superior 5-year postrelapse OS rates (74.4% and 70.2%, respectively), compared with other patients. Conversely, those with hypodiploidy, *KMT2A* rearrangements, or *TCF3*::*PBX1* gene fusions were more likely to have earlier relapses and had inferior 5-year postrelapse OS rates (14.2% ± 6.1%, 31.9% ± 7.7%, and 36.8% ± 6.6%, respectively). In multivariable analysis controlling for time to relapse, each of these cytogenetic abnormalities retained significance as an independent prognostic factor after relapse.[[15](#cit/section_10.15)]

Other studies have also demonstrated that patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* gene fusions have a more favorable prognosis after relapse.[[15](#cit/section_10.15),[32](#cit/section_10.32),[33](#cit/section_10.33)]

- In the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 ([NCT00114348](/clinicaltrials/NCT00114348)) study, an EFS rate of 84% (± 7%) was observed for patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* ALL with bone marrow relapse.[[32](#cit/section_10.32)] In this study, 94% of patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* had a duration of first remission that extended at least 6 months beyond completion of their primary treatment, and on multivariate analysis, time to relapse (and not the presence of *ETV6*::*RUNX1*) was an independent predictor of outcome.
- Similarly, the 5-year OS rate was 81% for patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* enrolled on the French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Study Group (FRALLE) 93 trial who relapsed at any site more than 36 months after diagnosis. The presence of *ETV6*::*RUNX1* was associated with a favorable survival outcome compared with other late relapsing patients.[[33](#cit/section_10.33)] However, the 3-year OS rate was only 31% for patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* who experienced an early relapse (<36 months).

Changes in variant profiles from diagnosis to relapse have been identified by gene sequencing.[[34](#cit/section_10.34),[35](#cit/section_10.35)] While oncogenic gene fusions (e.g., *TCF3*::*PBX1*, *ETV6*::*RUNX1*) are almost always observed between the time of initial diagnosis and relapse, single nucleotide variants and copy number variants may be present at diagnosis, but not at relapse, and vice versa.[[34](#cit/section_10.34),[36](#cit/section_10.36)] For example, while *RAS* family variants are common at both diagnosis and relapse, the specific *RAS* family variants may change from diagnosis to relapse as specific leukemic subclones rise and fall during the course of treatment.[[34](#cit/section_10.34)] By contrast, relapse-specific variants in *NT5C2* (a gene involved in nucleotide metabolism) have been noted in as many as 45% of ALL cases with early relapse.[[34](#cit/section_10.34),[37](#cit/section_10.37),[38](#cit/section_10.38)]

*TP53* alterations (variants and/or copy number alterations) are observed in approximately 10% of patients with ALL at first relapse and have been associated with an increased likelihood of persistent leukemia after initial reinduction and poor event-free survival (EFS) rates.[[21](#cit/section_10.21),[39](#cit/section_10.39)] In one study, approximately one-half of the *TP53* alterations were present at initial diagnosis and half were newly observed at time of relapse.[[39](#cit/section_10.39)]

*IKZF1* deletions have also been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with B-ALL in first bone marrow relapse.[[32](#cit/section_10.32)] However, in a BFM study of patients with B-ALL who experienced a late first marrow relapse, *IKZF1* deletions were not prognostically significant.[[21](#cit/section_10.21)]

RAS pathway variants (*KRAS*, *NRAS*, *FLT3*, and *PTPN11*) are common at relapse in B-ALL patients, and they were found in approximately 40% of patients at first relapse in one study of 206 children.[[34](#cit/section_10.34),[40](#cit/section_10.40)] As observed at diagnosis, the frequency of RAS pathway variants at relapse differs by cytogenetic subtype (e.g., high frequency in hyperdiploid cases and low frequency in *ETV6*::*RUNX1* cases). The presence of RAS pathway variants at relapse was associated with early relapse. However, presence of RAS pathway variants at relapse was not an independent predictor of outcome.

#### Immunophenotype

Immunophenotype is an important prognostic factor at relapse. Patients with T-ALL tend to experience earlier relapses than noninfant patients with B-ALL. In a study from the COG, the median time to relapse was 13.8 months for patients with T-ALL, compared with 34.6 months for noninfant patients with B-ALL. The 5-year postrelapse OS rate was only 35% for those with T-ALL, compared with 52.5% for noninfant patients with B-ALL.[[15](#cit/section_10.15)] Patients with T-ALL are less likely to achieve a second remission after relapse than those with B-ALL.[[5](#cit/section_10.5),[24](#cit/section_10.24)]

### Standard Treatment Options for First Bone Marrow Relapse of Childhood ALL

Standard treatment options for first bone marrow relapse include the following:

1. [Reinduction chemotherapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1356).
2. [Postreinduction therapy for patients achieving a second CR](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1402).

#### Reinduction chemotherapy

Initial treatment of relapse consists of reinduction therapy to achieve a second CR. Using either a four-drug reinduction regimen (similar to that administered to newly diagnosed high-risk patients) or an alternative regimen including high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, approximately 85% of patients with a marrow relapse achieve a second CR at the end of the first month of treatment.[[5](#cit/section_10.5)]; [[24](#cit/section_10.24),[41](#cit/section_10.41)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Patients with early marrow relapses have a lower rate of achieving a morphological second CR (approximately 70%) than do those with late marrow relapses (approximately 95%).[[24](#cit/section_10.24),[41](#cit/section_10.41)]

Evidence (reinduction chemotherapy):

1. A COG study used three blocks of intensive reinduction therapy with an initial four-drug combination that included doxorubicin followed by two intensive consolidation blocks before either HSCT or chemotherapy continuation.[[24](#cit/section_10.24)]

- Second remission was achieved after block 1 in 68% of patients with early relapse (<36 months from initial diagnosis) and in 96% of those with later relapse.
- Blocks 2 and 3 reduced MRD in 40 of 56 patients who were MRD positive after block 1.
2. A United Kingdom–based randomized trial of ALL patients in first relapse compared reinduction with a four-drug combination using idarubicin versus mitoxantrone.[[42](#cit/section_10.42)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- There was no difference in second CR rates or end-reinduction MRD levels between the two study arms.
- A significant improvement in the OS rate in the mitoxantrone arm was reported (69% vs. 45%; *P* = .007), which resulted from decreased relapse after transplant.

The potential benefit of mitoxantrone in relapsed ALL regimens requires further investigation.
3. Investigators from the ALL-REZ BFM group used a six-drug reinduction approach, which included high-dose methotrexate.[[43](#cit/section_10.43)]

- A randomized comparison of 1 g/m2 of methotrexate delivered over 36 hours versus 5 g/m2 of methotrexate delivered over 24 hours with reinduction showed no difference in outcome, but the 36-hour infusion was associated with a higher incidence of mucositis.
4. The combination of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide was reported to induce remission in 42% to 56% of patients with refractory or multiply relapsed disease.[[44](#cit/section_10.44),[45](#cit/section_10.45)]; [[46](#cit/section_10.46)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
5. The combination of bortezomib plus vincristine, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and doxorubicin has been reported to induce complete response (with or without platelet recovery) in 70% to 80% of multiply relapsed patients with B-ALL.[[47](#cit/section_10.47)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[48](#cit/section_10.48)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

1. This combination (using prednisone instead of dexamethasone) was tested in B-ALL patients with first relapse occurring less than 36 months from initial diagnosis.[[49](#cit/section_10.49)]

- The second CR rate was 68%, which was not significantly different from that observed on a predecessor trial using the same reinduction platform without bortezomib.
- In subset analyses, the addition of bortezomib to the four-drug reinduction platform did not result in significantly better second CR rates for patients with either very early relapses (<18 months from diagnosis) or early relapses (18–36 months from diagnosis) when compared with historical controls.

Patients with relapsed T-ALL have much lower rates of achieving second CR with standard reinduction regimens than do patients with B-cell phenotype.[[24](#cit/section_10.24)] Treatment of children with first relapse of T-ALL in the bone marrow with single-agent therapy using the T-cell selective agent, nelarabine, has resulted in response rates of approximately 50%.[[50](#cit/section_10.50)] In a trial of 28 pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL who were treated with single-agent nelarabine, the overall response rate (CR and CR without hematological recovery) was 39.3%.[[51](#cit/section_10.51)] The combination of nelarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide has also been used in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL, with response rates comparable to single-agent nelarabine.[[52](#cit/section_10.52)]; [[53](#cit/section_10.53)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] In a phase I/II trial of this combination in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, the overall best response rate (CR + CR with incomplete platelet recovery + partial response) was 38% (8 of 21 patients). The T-ALL cohort had a response rate of 33% (4 of 12 patients), and the T-lymphoblastic lymphoma cohort had a response rate of 44% (4 of 9 patients).[[53](#cit/section_10.53)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

The proteosome inhibitor bortezomib (in combination with chemotherapy) has also been evaluated in patients with relapsed T-ALL. In a phase II trial conducted by the COG, the combination of bortezomib plus vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase, and doxorubicin resulted in a second CR rate of 68% in T-ALL patients in first relapse.[[49](#cit/section_10.49)]

In the phase II open-label [DELPHINUS (NCT03384654)](/clinicaltrials/NCT03384654) study, daratumumab was added to induction backbone chemotherapy to treat patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. Daratumumab is a human IgGk monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, which is highly expressed on T-ALL blasts. Chemotherapy consisted of four-drug induction therapy. At the end of induction, the CR rates were 41.7% for children and 60.0% for young adults. The overall response rates (at any time point) were 83.3% for children and 80.0% for young adults. Patients who achieved a CR proceeded to HSCT. The 24-month EFS rates for children and young adults were 36.1% and 20.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates were 41.3% and 25.0%, respectively. The addition of daratumumab was shown to be tolerable.[[54](#cit/section_10.54)]

Reinduction failure is a poor prognostic factor, but subsequent attempts to obtain remission can be successful and lead to survival after HSCT, especially if MRD becomes low or nondetectable. For more information about MRD risk stratification, see the [Late-relapsing B-ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1403) section. Approaches have traditionally included the use of drug combinations distinct from the first attempt at treatment. These regimens often contain newer agents under investigation in clinical trials. Although survival is progressively less likely after each attempt, two to four additional attempts are often pursued, with diminishing levels of success measured after each attempt.[[55](#cit/section_10.55)] Because studies of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, blinatumomab, and inotuzumab have been shown to lead to high rates of remission in multiply relapsed and chemotherapy-refractory B-ALL patients, trials testing these agents after initial relapse are underway. For more information, see the [Immunotherapeutic Approaches for Relapsed or Refractory ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1928) section.

#### Postreinduction therapy for patients achieving a second complete remission

##### Early-relapsing B-ALL

For B-ALL patients with an early marrow relapse, allogeneic
transplant from an HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor that is
performed in second remission has been reported in most studies to result in higher leukemia-free survival
(LFS) than a chemotherapy approach.[[7](#cit/section_10.7),[30](#cit/section_10.30),[56](#cit/section_10.56)-[64](#cit/section_10.64)] However, even with transplant, the survival rate for patients with early marrow relapse is less than 50%. One study analyzed 278 patients with early-relapsing B-ALL who were treated between 2001 and 2013 in trials conducted by either the ALL-REZ BFM or UK-ALL groups. The OS rate was 32.6%.[[29](#cit/section_10.29)] More favorable outcomes were observed for patients with early-relapsed B-ALL who had low end-reinduction MRD, low pre-HSCT MRD, and those who experienced acute GVHD. For more information, see the [Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for First and Subsequent Bone Marrow Relapse](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1404) section.

After initial reinduction chemotherapy, the use of blinatumomab instead of intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy as pre-HSCT consolidation has been shown to be associated with superior outcomes.[[65](#cit/section_10.65),[66](#cit/section_10.66)]

Evidence (blinatumomab before HSCT in early-relapsing B-ALL):

1. In a randomized phase III trial conducted between 2015 and 2019, patients with early-relapsing B-ALL were randomly assigned to receive either one 28-day course of blinatumomab or a cycle of intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy as a third consolidation course before proceeding to HSCT. The study was intended to enroll 202 patients but was terminated early (after 108 patients enrolled) when the superiority of blinatumomab was demonstrated on the basis of a prespecified stopping rule.[[65](#cit/section_10.65)]

- The 24-month EFS rate was 66.2% for patients who received blinatumomab, compared with 27.1% for patients who received the intensive chemotherapy block (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; *P* < .001).
- The 24-month cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in patients who received blinatumomab than in patients who received intensive chemotherapy (24.9% vs. 70.8%; HR, 0.24).
- For patients with high MRD (≥10-4) at the time randomized treatment began, more patients achieved MRD negativity with blinatumomab treatment than with intensive chemotherapy treatment (93% vs. 24%).
2. A COG phase III clinical trial compared two courses of blinatumomab with two blocks of intensive chemotherapy in patients with B-ALL in first relapse. Treatment randomization occurred after a single block of intensive reinduction chemotherapy. Eligible patients included those with early relapse or those with late relapse but MRD levels greater than 0.1% after reinduction chemotherapy. Study enrollment ended early because of loss of clinical equipoise, in favor of blinatumomab. This was determined by the study’s data and safety monitoring committee. Key findings from the trial include the following:[[66](#cit/section_10.66)]

- The 2-year DFS rate was 54.4% for patients who received blinatumomab versus 39.0% for patients who received chemotherapy (HR for disease progression or mortality, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47–1.03).
- The 2-year OS rate was 71.3% for patients who received blinatumomab versus 58.4% for patients who received chemotherapy (HR for mortality, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.98).
- Negative MRD rates were higher for patients after one or two courses of blinatumomab (75% and 66%, respectively) than for patients after one or two courses of intensive chemotherapy (32% and 32%, respectively).
- Adverse event rates for toxicities such as sepsis, mucositis, and febrile neutropenia were much lower for patients who received blinatumomab than for patients who received intensive chemotherapy.

##### Late-relapsing B-ALL

Previous studies of late marrow relapse in patients with B-ALL showed that a primary chemotherapy approach after achievement of second CR resulted in survival rates of approximately 50%, and it was not clear whether allogeneic transplant was associated with a superior cure rate.[[5](#cit/section_10.5),[9](#cit/section_10.9),[42](#cit/section_10.42),[67](#cit/section_10.67)-[69](#cit/section_10.69)]; [[70](#cit/section_10.70)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Subsequent data have shown that the presence of end-reinduction MRD identifies patients with a high risk of ensuing relapse if treated with chemotherapy alone (no HSCT) in second CR. A number of studies have shown that patients with a late marrow relapse who have high end-reinduction MRD have better outcomes if they receive an allogeneic HSCT in second CR after achieving low or nondetectable MRD status.[[18](#cit/section_10.18),[71](#cit/section_10.71)]

Evidence (MRD-based risk stratification for late-relapse of B-ALL):

1. In BFM studies, patients are considered to be intermediate risk if they have a late isolated marrow relapse or an early or late combined marrow/extramedullary relapse. In the ALL-REZ BFM P95/96 study from this group, end-reinduction MRD (assessed by a polymerase chain reaction–based assay) significantly predicted outcomes of children with intermediate-risk relapsed B-ALL treated with chemotherapy alone in second CR (no HSCT).[[28](#cit/section_10.28)]

- Patients with low MRD (<0.1%) had a 10-year EFS rate of 73%, while those with high MRD (≥0.1%) had a 10-year EFS rate of 10%. On multivariate analysis, end-reinduction MRD was the strongest independent prognostic factor.
2. In a subsequent BFM study ([ALL-REZ BFM 2002 [NCT00114348]](/clinicaltrials/NCT00114348)), patients with intermediate-risk relapse were allocated to allogeneic HSCT if they had high MRD at the end of the first month of treatment. Those who had low end-reinduction MRD were treated with chemotherapy only (no HSCT).[[71](#cit/section_10.71)]

- The EFS rate was 64% for patients with high end-reinduction MRD treated with allogeneic HSCT in second CR, which was significantly better than what had been observed on the previous P95/96 trial, during which such patients received chemotherapy without HSCT. The improvement in EFS was primarily because of a significantly lower risk of relapse in the cohort who underwent HSCT in second CR (cumulative incidence of relapse, 27% on the 2002 trial compared with 59% on the P95/96 trial).
- Patients with late marrow-involved relapses and low end-reinduction MRD, treated with chemotherapy only, had a 5-year EFS rate of 76%, confirming the results seen in the previous P95/96 trial. However, the chemotherapy-only strategy resulted in a significantly worse outcome for patients with early-combined relapses (marrow plus extramedullary site) and low end-reinduction MRD. The 5-year EFS rate was only 37% for these patients. Because of these data, patients with early-combined relapses are now considered high risk on BFM trials.
- For patients with late marrow-involved relapses and high end-reinduction MRD (defined as ≥0.1%), level of MRD was prognostically significant. The 10-year EFS rate was significantly worse for those with MRD levels of ≥1% compared with those with MRD levels of ≥0.1% to <1% (56% vs. 74%, respectively; *P* = .02). Conversely, for patients with low end-reinduction MRD (<0.1%), there was no significant difference in EFS between those with very low MRD (<0.01%) versus those with MRD levels between 0.01% and <0.1%.[[21](#cit/section_10.21)]
3. The United Kingdom ALLR3 trial assigned patients who relapsed more than 6 months after completion of front-line therapy to HSCT if their end-reinduction MRD was ≥0.01% or to chemotherapy for those with MRD of <0.01%.[[18](#cit/section_10.18)]

- Of the 228 patients treated, 220 patients achieved CR; 127 patients were allocated to HSCT (high MRD) and 93 were allocated to chemotherapy (low or not evaluable MRD). The 5-year EFS rates were 72% for patients with low MRD versus 56% for patients with high MRD. The 5-year OS rates were 87% for low MRD and 64% for high end-reinduction MRD.
- On the basis of these data, investigators from the United Kingdom recommend HSCT for late-relapsing patients with B-ALL who have MRD of ≥0.01% after reinduction therapy and chemotherapy alone for those with end-reinduction MRD of <0.01%.
4. In the COG [AALL1331 (NCT02883049)](/clinicaltrials/NCT02883049) trial, patients with low-risk relapsed ALL were randomly assigned to receive either standard chemotherapy or standard chemotherapy with three blocks of blinatumomab replacing one block of intensive chemotherapy. Low risk was defined as end-reinduction MRD levels of <0.1% in patients with either bone marrow relapse occurring more than 36 months after diagnosis or extramedullary relapse occurring more than 18 months after diagnosis.[[72](#cit/section_10.72)]

- For all 255 patients in the protocol, the 4-year DFS rates were 61.2% for patients who received blinatumomab and 49.5% for patients who received standard chemotherapy (*P* = .0849). The 4-year OS rates were 90.4% for patients who received blinatumomab, compared with 79.6% for patients who received standard chemotherapy (*P* = .11).
- For patients with bone marrow relapse with or without extramedullary involvement, the 4-year DFS rates were 72.7% for patients who received blinatumomab and 53.7% for those who received standard chemotherapy (*P* = .015). The 4-year OS rates were 97.1% for patients who received blinatumomab, compared with 84.8% for the chemotherapy-only group (*P* = .02).
- The outcomes were poor for patients with isolated extramedullary relapse, regardless of treatment arm. Outcomes for these patients were inferior to those of similar patients in previous trials. The 4-year DFS rates were 36.6% for patients who received blinatumomab and 38.8% for those who received chemotherapy only (*P* = .62). The 4-year OS rates were 76.5% for the blinatumomab group, compared with 68.8% for the chemotherapy-only group (*P* = .53).
- Patients who received blinatumomab experienced much lower rates of toxicities such as mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis than patients who received standard chemotherapy. For example, 11% of patients who received standard chemotherapy developed sepsis, compared with less than 2% of patients who received blinatumomab. Similarly, febrile neutropenia occurred in 3% of patients who received blinatumomab, compared with 48% of those who received standard chemotherapy.
5. The COG [AALL0433 (NCT00381680)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00381680) trial included patients with intermediate-risk relapse of B-ALL (defined as late marrow-involved relapse occurring >36 months from initial diagnosis, or very early isolated extramedullary relapse occurring <18 months from initial diagnosis). Patients received three induction blocks, followed either by an intensive chemotherapy backbone (with radiation therapy for patients with CNS or testicular involvement) or allogeneic HSCT (if matched-sibling donors were available). The trial also included a randomized comparison of standard versus intensified vincristine dosing. Of the 271 eligible patients, 257 (95%) achieved second CR. Of these patients, 74 (29% of those in second CR) received HSCT, 47 of whom had matched-sibling donors and 27 of whom had other donors.[[31](#cit/section_10.31)]

- For all 271 eligible patients, the 3-year EFS and OS rates were 63.6% and 72.3%, respectively.
- For patients with late marrow-involved relapses (n = 242), the 3-year EFS and OS rates were 66.3% and 74.8%, respectively.
- For patients with late marrow relapses, MRD at the end of the first month of treatment (end-reinduction MRD) was a significant prognostic factor. For patients with end-reinduction MRD less than 0.1%, the 3-year EFS rate was 84.9%, versus 53.7% for those with MRD higher than 0.1%.
- Adjusting for median time to HSCT, patients who received HSCT had an improved 3-year DFS rate (*P* = .03), but not OS rate (*P* = .46), compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone.
- The vincristine randomization was stopped early because of excessive toxicity, particularly in older patients.

##### *BCR*::*ABL1* (Philadelphia chromosome–positive [Ph+]) ALL

There is limited information regarding the treatment of patients with relapsed *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

A French multi-institutional study reported on 27 children with relapsed *BCR*::*ABL1* ALL (24 overt, 3 molecular) who had all been initially treated with a regimen that included imatinib.[[73](#cit/section_10.73)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Among patients treated with either an intensive or nonintensive induction regimen, 96% obtained a second CR.
- Approximately one-half of the patients received consolidation therapy, and 78% of the patients proceeded to allogeneic HSCT.
- At the time of relapse, the TKI was changed for 23 of the 26 (88%) patients, 15 of whom (58%) received dasatinib. The 4-year EFS rate was 60.9%, and the OS rate was 76.1%.

##### T-ALL

For patients with T-ALL who achieve remission after bone marrow relapse, outcomes with postreinduction chemotherapy alone have generally been poor,[[5](#cit/section_10.5)] and these patients are usually treated with allogeneic HSCT in second CR, regardless of time to relapse. At 3 years, the OS rate after allogeneic transplant for T-ALL in second remission was reported to be 48%, and the DFS rate was 46%.[[74](#cit/section_10.74)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### Treatment Options for Second and Subsequent Bone Marrow Relapse

Although there are no studies directly comparing chemotherapy with HSCT for patients in third or subsequent CR, because cure with chemotherapy alone is rare, transplant has generally been considered a reasonable approach for those achieving remission. Long-term survival for ALL patients after a second relapse is particularly poor, in the range of less than 10% to 20%.[[62](#cit/section_10.62)] One of the main reasons for this is failure to obtain a third remission. Numerous attempts at novel combination approaches have resulted in only about 40% of children in second relapse achieving remission.[[75](#cit/section_10.75)] However, two studies that added bortezomib to standard reinduction agents in multiply relapsed or refractory patients have resulted in 70% to 80% CR rates.[[47](#cit/section_10.47)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[48](#cit/section_10.48)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Clofarabine as a single agent has also been used in patients with multiply relapsed and refractory leukemia. In an analysis of 12 clinical studies of clofarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the overall remission rate (CR plus CR with either incomplete platelet recovery or incomplete neutrophil and platelet recovery) was 28%.[[76](#cit/section_10.76)]

A phase I trial tested the combination of venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor) and navitoclax (BCL2 and BCL-XL inhibitor) given along with standard chemotherapy (vincristine, dexamethasone, with/without pegaspargase) in adult and pediatric patients with multiply relapsed or refractory B-ALL or T-ALL. The combination was well tolerated in general (the major toxicity was prolonged myelosuppression) and CR was achieved in 60% of patients, 57% of whom had nondetectable MRD.[[77](#cit/section_10.77)]

For multiply relapsed patients who achieve CR, HSCT has been shown to cure 20% to 35%, with failures occurring because of high rates of relapse and transplant-related mortality.[[78](#cit/section_10.78)-[82](#cit/section_10.82)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Given the poor outcomes for multiply relapsed B-ALL patients who are treated with chemotherapy followed by HSCT, CAR T-cell therapy has come to be used as standard in this population and has resulted in high rates of remission and improved survival (although direct comparative trials are lacking). For more information, see the [CAR T-cell therapy](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1932) section.

Immune therapies such as blinatumomab and inotuzumab have been used in this population and have improved rates of remission, which has then often led to cure when followed by HSCT.[[83](#cit/section_10.83)-[87](#cit/section_10.87)] Comparative studies of immune and cell therapy approaches have yet to be performed in this population, so data to inform optimal approaches to first therapy or sequence of therapies are lacking.

### Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for First and Subsequent Bone Marrow Relapse

#### Components of the transplant process

An expert panel review of indications for HSCT was published in 2012.[[88](#cit/section_10.88)] Components of the transplant process that have been shown to be important in improving or predicting outcome of HSCT for children with ALL include the following:

1. [Total-body irradiation (TBI)-containing transplant preparative regimens](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1505).
2. [MRD detection just before transplant](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1508).
3. [MRD detection posttransplant](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1711).
4. [Donor type and HLA match](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1510).
5. [Role of GVHD/graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) in ALL and immune modulation after transplant to prevent relapse](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1513).

An analysis from the CIBMTR examined pretransplant variables to create a model for predicting LFS posttransplant in pediatric patients (aged <18 years). All patients were first transplant recipients who had myeloablative conditioning, and all stem cells sources were included. For patients with ALL, the predictors associated with lower LFS included age younger than 2 years, second CR or higher, MRD positivity (only in second CR, not in first CR), and presence of morphologically detectable disease at time of transplant. A scale was established to stratify patients on the basis of risk factors to predict survival. The 5-year LFS rate was 68% for the low-risk group, 51% for the intermediate-risk group, and 33% for the high-risk group.[[89](#cit/section_10.89)]

##### TBI-containing transplant preparative regimens

For patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT, TBI appears to be an important component of the conditioning regimen. Several studies have indicated that TBI is associated with superior outcomes in patients with ALL compared with chemotherapy-only preparative regimens.

Evidence (TBI as part of the preparative regimen for ALL):

1. Two registry studies and a small randomized trial showed that transplant conditioning regimens that included
TBI resulted in higher cure rates than chemotherapy-only
preparative regimens.[[56](#cit/section_10.56),[90](#cit/section_10.90),[91](#cit/section_10.91)]
2. An international study (United States, Europe, and Australia) that combined data sets from prospective trials and single-center data showed that the use of non-TBI regimens was an independent risk factor for poor outcome.[[74](#cit/section_10.74),[81](#cit/section_10.81),[92](#cit/section_10.92)]
3. An international phase III trial (the FORUM study) conducted between 2013 and 2018 enrolled 417 pediatric patients aged 4 to 21 years with ALL. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TBI (12 Gy) with etoposide or chemotherapy only (fludarabine, thiotepa, and busulfan or treosulfan) as a preparative regimen. All patients were in morphological CR at the time of transplant and received a 9/10 or 10/10 matched sibling donor (MSD) or unrelated matched donor (URD) transplant. The intent was to enroll 1,000 patients, but the study was closed to enrollment early when a futility early stopping rule was met, indicating that the chemotherapy-only preparative regimen was associated with an inferior outcome.[[93](#cit/section_10.93)]

- The 2-year OS rate was 91% for patients who received a TBI-containing regimen, compared with 75% for those who received a chemotherapy-only preparative regimen (*P* < .001).
- The 2-year EFS rate was also superior in patients who received TBI (86% vs. 58%, *P* < .001), primarily because of a lower cumulative incidence of relapse in the TBI cohort (2-year cumulative incidence of relapse, 12% for TBI patients vs. 33% for chemotherapy-only patients).
- In subgroup analysis, the TBI regimen was superior regardless of donor type (MSD vs. URD), immunophenotype (B-ALL vs. T-ALL), and whether transplant occurred in first CR or second CR.
- There was no difference in the rates of acute or chronic GVHD or frequency of grades 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse events between the two randomized treatment arms.
4. A substudy of the FORUM trial compared two chemotherapy preparative regimens (busulfan/thiotepa/fludarabine with treosulfan/thiotepa/fludarabine) in 191 children (aged <4 years) who were nonrandomly assigned to non-TBI regimens. The two regimens were also nonrandomly assigned by center/country preference, as some countries did not have access to treosulfan.[[94](#cit/section_10.94)]

- The 3-year probabilities of EFS and OS were 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44–0.59) and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.61–0.76), respectively.
- Multivariate analysis showed no difference in EFS and OS according to preparative regimen used, but decreased OS for patients with *KMT2A* rearrangements and lower EFS in children younger than 1 year at diagnosis.
- A historical comparison was conducted between patients aged 2 to 4 years in this trial and patients aged 2 to 4 years who received TBI regimens in two previous international studies performed by the same group. In the ALL-SCT BFM 2003 trial, 3-year probabilities of EFS and OS were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.66–0.92) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76–0.97), respectively. In the ALL-SCT BFM International trial, the 3-year probabilities of EFS and OS were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.57–0.97) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.61–0.99), respectively. In the FORUM trial, the 3-year probabilities of EFS and OS for children who received either chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.44–0.64) and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57–0.76), respectively (*P* = .007 and *P* = .008 for comparison with the TBI-based trials, respectively).
- The authors concluded that there is strong evidence that TBI-based regimens are superior in children older than 2 years, and this result should be considered as parents and clinicians evaluate the risks and benefits of TBI in children aged 2 to 4 years.

Based on these data, TBI for all but the youngest children (age <2–3 years) remains standard of care in most centers in North America and Europe.[[74](#cit/section_10.74),[81](#cit/section_10.81),[92](#cit/section_10.92)-[94](#cit/section_10.94)]

Fractionated TBI (total dose, 12–14 Gy) is often combined with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, thiotepa, or a combination of these agents. Study findings with these combinations have generally resulted in similar rates of survival,[[95](#cit/section_10.95)-[97](#cit/section_10.97)] although one study suggested that if cyclophosphamide is used without other chemotherapy drugs, a dose of TBI in the higher range may be necessary.[[98](#cit/section_10.98)] Many standard regimens include cyclophosphamide with TBI dosing between 13.2 and 14 Gy. On the other hand, when cyclophosphamide and etoposide were used with TBI, doses above 12 Gy resulted in worse survival resulting from excessive toxicity.[[96](#cit/section_10.96)]

A secondary analysis of the COG [ASCT0431 (NCT00382109)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00382109) HSCT trial showed that ALL patients treated with TBI that involved dose modulation of lung fields to less than 8 Gy had a survival advantage on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; *P* = .04). Transplant-related mortality trended higher for patients who received doses of 8 Gy and higher, but did not reach significance (HR, 1.78; *P* = .21). Because lower doses were not associated with increased relapse and resulted in improved survival, dose modulation for lung fields to less than 8 Gy was included in the COG [AALL1331 (NCT02883049)](/clinicaltrials/NCT02883049) trial. Results from the AALL1331 study and other studies looking more precisely into pulmonary dose modulation for TBI are needed to clarify and explain this observation.[[99](#cit/section_10.99)]

##### MRD detection just before transplant

Remission status at the time of transplant has long been known to be an important predictor of outcome, with patients not in CR at HSCT having very poor survival rates.[[100](#cit/section_10.100)] Several studies have also demonstrated that the level of MRD at the time of transplant is a key risk factor in children with ALL in CR undergoing allogeneic HSCT.[[27](#cit/section_10.27),[101](#cit/section_10.101)-[109](#cit/section_10.109)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[21](#cit/section_10.21),[29](#cit/section_10.29),[92](#cit/section_10.92),[110](#cit/section_10.110)] Survival rates of patients who are MRD positive pretransplant have been reported between 20% and 47%, compared with 60% to 88% in patients who are MRD negative.

When patients received two to three cycles of chemotherapy in an attempt to achieve an MRD-negative remission, the benefit of further intensive therapy for achieving MRD negativity must be weighed against the potential for significant toxicity. In addition, there is not clear evidence showing that MRD positivity in a patient who has received multiple cycles of therapy is a biological disease marker for poor outcome that cannot be modified, or whether further intervention bringing such patients into an MRD negative remission will overcome this risk factor and improve survival.

- In one report, 13 patients with ALL and high MRD at the time of planned transplant received an additional cycle of chemotherapy in an attempt to lower MRD before proceeding to HSCT. Ten of the 13 patients (77%) remained in CR post-HSCT, with no relapses observed in the eight patients who achieved low MRD after the additional chemotherapy cycle. In comparison, only 6 of 21 high-MRD patients (29%) who proceeded directly to HSCT without receiving additional pre-HSCT chemotherapy remained in CR.[[102](#cit/section_10.102)]

##### MRD detection posttransplant

The presence of detectable MRD post-HSCT has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent relapse.[[108](#cit/section_10.108),[111](#cit/section_10.111)-[114](#cit/section_10.114)] For patients with MRD that is detectable pre-HSCT, the detection of any level of MRD post-HSCT puts that patient at very high risk of failure (>90%).[[92](#cit/section_10.92)] The accuracy of MRD for predicting relapse increases as time from HSCT elapses and relapse risk is higher for patients who have higher levels of MRD detected at any given time. One study showed higher sensitivity for predicting relapse using next-generation sequencing assays than with flow cytometry, especially early after HSCT.[[113](#cit/section_10.113)]

##### Donor type and HLA match

Survival rates after matched unrelated donor and umbilical cord blood transplant have improved significantly over the past decade and offer an outcome similar to that obtained with matched sibling donor transplants.[[60](#cit/section_10.60),[115](#cit/section_10.115)-[118](#cit/section_10.118)]; [[119](#cit/section_10.119),[120](#cit/section_10.120)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[121](#cit/section_10.121)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[122](#cit/section_10.122)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Rates of clinically extensive GVHD and treatment-related mortality remain higher after unrelated donor transplant compared with matched sibling donor transplants.[[61](#cit/section_10.61),[78](#cit/section_10.78),[115](#cit/section_10.115)] However, there is some evidence that matched unrelated donor transplant may yield a lower relapse rate. National Marrow Donor Program and CIBMTR analyses have demonstrated that rates of GVHD, treatment-related mortality, and OS have improved over time.[[123](#cit/section_10.123)-[125](#cit/section_10.125)]; [[126](#cit/section_10.126),[127](#cit/section_10.127)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Another CIBMTR study suggested that outcome after one- or two-antigen mismatched cord blood transplants may be equivalent to that for a matched family donor or a matched unrelated donor.[[128](#cit/section_10.128)] In certain cases in which no suitable donor is found or an immediate transplant is considered crucial, a haploidentical transplant using large doses of stem cells may be considered.[[129](#cit/section_10.129),[130](#cit/section_10.130)] Improved approaches to haploidentical HSCT using alpha-beta T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD19 depletion or posttransplant cyclophosphamide have shown survival rates that are similar to those in studies using other stem cell sources.[[131](#cit/section_10.131)] A large multicenter trial from Italy showed similar outcomes using alpha-beta TCR/CD19–depleted haploidentical donors compared with matched unrelated donors, with lower rates of GVHD.[[132](#cit/section_10.132)] A second multicenter trial using alpha-beta TCR/CD19–depleted killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)–favorable haploidentical donors showed survival outcomes comparable to all other stem cell sources, with lower rates of GVHD and transplant-related mortality.[[133](#cit/section_10.133)]

##### Role of GVHD/GVL in ALL and immune modulation after transplant to prevent relapse

Most studies of pediatric and young adult patients that address this issue suggest an effect of both acute and chronic GVHD in decreasing relapse.[[115](#cit/section_10.115),[134](#cit/section_10.134)-[137](#cit/section_10.137)]

- In a COG trial of transplant for children with ALL, grades I to III acute GVHD were associated with lower relapse risk (HR, 0.4; *P* = .04) and better EFS (multivariate analysis, HR, 0.5; *P* = .02). Any effect of grade IV acute GVHD in decreasing relapse risk was obscured by a marked increase in transplant-related mortality (HR, 6.4; *P* = .003), while grades I to III acute GVHD had no statistically detectable effect on transplant-related mortality (HR, 0.6; *P* = .42).[[136](#cit/section_10.136)]
- In a multivariate model, both pretransplant MRD and acute GVHD were independent predictors of relapse, with the lowest risk of relapse observed in patients with both low pretransplant MRD and grades I to III acute GVHD.[[112](#cit/section_10.112)] For patients who did not develop acute GVHD by day 55 post-HSCT, nearly all relapses occurred between days 100 and 400 post-HSCT.

To harness this GVL effect, a number of approaches to prevent relapse after transplant have been studied, including withdrawal of immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusion and targeted immunotherapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and natural killer cell therapy.[[138](#cit/section_10.138),[139](#cit/section_10.139)] Trials in Europe and the United States have shown that patients defined as having a high risk of relapse based on increasing recipient chimerism (i.e., increased percentage of recipient DNA markers) can successfully undergo withdrawal of immune suppression without excessive toxicity.[[140](#cit/section_10.140),[141](#cit/section_10.141)]

- One study showed that in 46 patients with increasing recipient chimerism, the 31 patients who underwent immune suppression withdrawal, donor lymphocyte infusion, or both therapies had a 3-year EFS rate of 37% versus 0% in the nonintervention group (*P* < .001).[[142](#cit/section_10.142)]
- Other studies have shown better-than-expected rates of survival of pre-HSCT, MRD-positive patients when tapering of immunosuppression medication has occurred for MRD detected after HSCT.[[143](#cit/section_10.143)]
- A large international study showed a marked decrease in relapse in patients who experienced MRD-positive disease after HSCT and developed acute GHVD (HR, 0.29; *P* < .001), resulting in improved EFS (HR, 2.9; *P* = .01). Acute GVHD significantly decreased relapse and improved EFS in both MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients. Chronic GVHD was also associated with less relapse in both MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients.[[92](#cit/section_10.92)]

#### Intrathecal medication after HSCT to prevent relapse

The use of post-HSCT intrathecal chemotherapy chemoprophylaxis is controversial.[[144](#cit/section_10.144)-[147](#cit/section_10.147)]

#### Relapse after allogeneic HSCT for relapsed ALL

For patients with B-ALL who relapse after allogeneic HSCT and can be successfully weaned from immune suppression and have no GVHD, tisagenlecleucel and other 4-1BB CAR T-cell approaches have resulted in EFS rates exceeding 50% at 12 months.[[148](#cit/section_10.148)] For patients with T-ALL who relapse or for patients with B-ALL who are unable to undergo CAR T-cell therapy, a second ablative allogeneic HSCT may be feasible. However, many patients will be unable to undergo a second HSCT procedure because of failure to achieve remission, early toxic death, or severe organ toxicity related to salvage chemotherapy.[[149](#cit/section_10.149)] Among the highly selected group of patients able to undergo a second ablative allogeneic HSCT, approximately 10% to 30% will achieve long-term EFS.[[149](#cit/section_10.149)-[154](#cit/section_10.154)]; [[82](#cit/section_10.82),[155](#cit/section_10.155)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Prognosis is more favorable in patients with longer duration of remission after the first HSCT and in patients with CR at the time of the second HSCT.[[151](#cit/section_10.151),[152](#cit/section_10.152),[156](#cit/section_10.156)] In addition, one study showed an improvement in survival after second HSCT if acute GVHD occurred, especially if it had not occurred after the first transplant.[[157](#cit/section_10.157)]

Reduced-intensity approaches can also cure a percentage of patients when used as a second allogeneic transplant approach, but only if patients achieve a CR confirmed by flow cytometry.[[158](#cit/section_10.158)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Donor leukocyte infusion has limited benefit for patients with ALL who relapse after allogeneic HSCT.[[159](#cit/section_10.159)]; [[160](#cit/section_10.160)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Whether a second allogeneic transplant is necessary to treat isolated CNS and testicular relapse after HSCT is unknown. A small series has shown survival in selected patients using chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by a second transplant.[[161](#cit/section_10.161)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### Immunotherapeutic Approaches for Relapsed or Refractory ALL

Immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL include monoclonal antibody therapy and CAR T-cell therapy.

#### Monoclonal antibody therapy

The following two immunotherapeutic agents have been studied for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL:

- **Blinatumomab.** Blinatumomab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody with one site for CD3 (T cells) and the other site for CD19 (present on most B-ALL cells). Thus, blinatumomab promotes the binding of the patient’s own cytotoxic T cells to B lymphoblasts, resulting in the tumor being killed.

In a phase I/II trial of children younger than 18 years with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, 27 of 70 patients (39%) treated at the recommended phase II dose achieved a CR with single-agent blinatumomab; 52% of those achieving CR were MRD negative.[[162](#cit/section_10.162)]

In a pooled analysis of five trials that included 166 pediatric and 517 adult patients, those with less than 50% bone marrow blasts at the start of treatment had better responses to blinatumomab. Among pediatric patients, CR rates (including CR with partial hematologic recovery [CRh] and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) were 65.3% for patients with less than 50% baseline bone marrow blast percentage, compared with 38.3% for patients with 50% or more baseline bone marrow blast percentage. Similarly, MRD responses were more frequent in patients with less than 50% baseline bone marrow blast percentage than in those who had 50% or more bone marrow blast percentage (51.4% vs. 25.5%). There was no significant difference in these end points when comparing patients with 5% to <25% blasts and 25% to <50% blasts at the start of blinatumomab treatment.[[163](#cit/section_10.163)]
- **Inotuzumab.** Inotuzumab is an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody that is conjugated to calicheamicin.

In trials of adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, CR was achieved in approximately 80% of patients.[[164](#cit/section_10.164),[165](#cit/section_10.165)]

There have been two phase II trials of single-agent inotuzumab (both trials used 1.8 mg/m2 total dose in the first course and 1.5 mg/m2 in subsequent courses) used in the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed (second or greater relapse) or refractory ALL.[[87](#cit/section_10.87)]

- In the COG phase II trial (N = 48), the overall response rate (ORR) (CR + CRi) was 58.3% after the first course, and 62.5% after two courses. Of those achieving complete response or complete response with incomplete count recovery, 70% were MRD negative (<0.01%). Overall, inotuzumab was well tolerated, without any significant hepatoxicity or sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) during treatment. However, of 21 patients who subsequently went on to receive HSCT, 6 (28.6%) developed SOS.[[87](#cit/section_10.87)]
- On a phase II trial conducted by the Innovative Therapies for Children With Cancer group (N = 28), the ORR was 81.5% (all responses occurring after the first cycle). Of the patients achieving a response, 81.8% achieved MRD negativity (<0.01%), 59.1% after the first course, and the remaining patients after the second course. SOS was observed in seven (28%) patients, six after subsequent HSCT and one during inotuzumab therapy. There was no correlation between the extent of CD22 expression (mean fluorescence index or percentage of CD22 positive cells) and response. In a post-hoc analysis, combining patients from the phase I and phase II trials, the authors found that having a shorter interval between last dose of inotuzumab and undergoing HSCT was associated with a higher risk of developing SOS.[[166](#cit/section_10.166)]

Expert panel recommendations for the prevention of SOS associated with HSCT after inotuzumab include limiting inotuzumab to two courses, avoiding dual-alkylator HSCT regimens, avoiding hepatotoxic agents, and considering SOS prophylactic agents.[[167](#cit/section_10.167)]
- **Rituximab or ofatumumab.** These monoclonal antibodies target CD20, which is poorly expressed in younger children with ALL, but more common in teenagers and young adults. A number of studies have suggested benefit when adding one of these agents to reinduction chemotherapy in adults,[[168](#cit/section_10.168),[169](#cit/section_10.169)] but very little data have been published in children.

#### CAR T-cell therapy

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a therapeutic strategy for pediatric B-ALL patients with refractory disease or those in second or subsequent relapse. This treatment involves engineering T cells with a CAR that redirects T-cell specificity and function.[[170](#cit/section_10.170)] One widely utilized target of CAR-modified T cells is the CD19 antigen expressed on almost all normal B cells and most B-cell malignancies.

##### Toxicities associated with CAR T-cell therapy

Treatment with CAR T cells has been associated with cytokine release syndrome, which can be life-threatening.[[171](#cit/section_10.171),[172](#cit/section_10.172)] Cytokine release syndrome presents as fever, headache, myalgias, hypotension, capillary leak, hypoxia, and renal dysfunction. Severe cytokine release syndrome has been effectively treated with tocilizumab, an anti–interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody.[[171](#cit/section_10.171),[173](#cit/section_10.173)] Long-term persistence of CAR T cells can lead to B-cell aplasia, necessitating immunoglobulin replacement.[[171](#cit/section_10.171)]

Neurotoxicity, including aphasia, altered mental status, and seizures, has also been observed with CAR T-cell therapy, and the symptoms usually resolve spontaneously.[[174](#cit/section_10.174)] CNS symptoms have not responded to IL-6R–targeting agents or other approaches.

Other CAR T-cell therapy side effects include coagulopathy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)–like laboratory changes, and cardiac dysfunction. Between 20% and 40% of patients require treatment in the intensive care unit, mostly pressor support, with 10% to 20% of patients requiring intubation and/or dialysis.[[170](#cit/section_10.170),[171](#cit/section_10.171),[175](#cit/section_10.175),[176](#cit/section_10.176)] In one study, patients who developed HLH-like toxicities after CAR T-cell therapy had lower relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS rates than those who did not develop these toxicities (RFS rates, 25.7% vs. 57.6%; OS rates, 4% vs. 81%).[[177](#cit/section_10.177)]

For an extensive discussion of CAR T-cell toxicities and approaches to mitigate these toxicities, see [Pediatric Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapy](/types/childhood-cancers/hp-stem-cell-transplant/car-t-cell-therapy).

##### CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy

Several clinical trials of CAR T cells targeting CD19 in relapsed/refractory ALL have been conducted, with encouraging results. Published trials have involved the use of two types of costimulatory molecules, 4-1BB and CD28. CD28-based approaches have led to high rates of remission, but CAR T cells in these trials rarely persist longer than 1 to 2 months, necessitating HSCT for long-term survival.[[178](#cit/section_10.178)] Many of the trials that used 4-1BB costimulation have resulted in persistence of CAR T cells for extended periods and long-term responses.[[148](#cit/section_10.148),[175](#cit/section_10.175)] Because early reports of efficacy were markedly better than previous experiences, trials leading to regulatory approval for tisagenlecleucel for multiply relapsed/refractory ALL were performed without randomization, relying on historical experiences for their statistical design. Retrospective matched-control analyses using pre-CAR T-cell therapy standard-of-care cohorts have shown marked improvements in OS and EFS with tisagenlecleucel. However, to date, no prospective trials have compared CAR T-cell approaches with other treatment modalities.[[179](#cit/section_10.179)]

Evidence (CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy):

1. In pilot clinical trials conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 30 children and adults (25 of whom were aged 22 years or younger) with multiply relapsed or refractory CD19-positive ALL were given T cells transduced with CD19-directed 4-1BB CAR lentiviral vector.[[171](#cit/section_10.171)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- CR was obtained in 90% of patients, including 15 of 18 patients (83%) who had previously received allogeneic HSCT.
- The 6-month EFS rate was 67%, with most patients showing persistence of the CAR T cells and B-cell aplasia through 6 months.
- All 30 patients experienced some degree of cytokine release syndrome. Eight patients (27%) had severe symptoms requiring vasopressors and/or respiratory support. Cytokine release syndrome was effectively treated with tocilizumab.
2. A report of a phase I trial of 45 children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive B-ALL who received 4-1BB–based lentiviral vector expanded CAR T cells showed the following:[[175](#cit/section_10.175)]

- An overall remission rate of 89% for all patients enrolled using an intent-to-treat analysis.
- Improved long-term persistence of CAR T cells and B-cell aplasia in patients who: (1) received lymphodepleting strategies that contain fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and (2) started the treatment with a higher percentage of cells expressing CD19, either on blasts or normal B cells.
3. A global phase II trial of the anti-CD19 4-1BB vector developed at the CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of tisagenlecleucel for children with multiply relapsed or refractory B-ALL.[[148](#cit/section_10.148)]

- Of 92 patients enrolled, 75 were infused with successfully manufactured CAR T cells. Eighty-one percent of infused patients had two measures noting CR within the first 3 months of infusion, and 100% of the remissions were MRD negative.
- The EFS rate of infused patients was 73% at 6 months and 50% at 12 months. The OS rate of infused patients was 90% at 6 months and 70% at 12 months.
- The CIBMTR performed a real-world analysis of 255 patients with ALL that largely duplicated the outcomes shown in the pivotal trials, with an initial CR rate of 85.5%. The 12-month duration of response rate was 69.9%, the EFS rate was 52.4%, and the OS rate was 77.2%.[[180](#cit/section_10.180)]
4. Children younger than 3 years were not included in the approval trial for tisagenlecleucel. A subgroup of patients, infants diagnosed at younger than 1 year with *KMT2A*-rearranged leukemia, often have disease that is highly refractory to intensive chemotherapy approaches. A multicenter retrospective study reported the outcomes of children younger than 3 years (originally diagnosed as high-risk infant ALL) with relapsed or refractory B-ALL who received commercial tisagenlecleucel.[[181](#cit/section_10.181)]

- Thirty-eight eligible patients were screened, 35 of whom (92%) were infused with tisagenlecleucel (2 patients did not receive an infusion because CAR T-cell manufacturing failed and 1 patient had disease progression).
- Twenty-nine of 38 patients (76%) had *KMT2A* rearrangements, and 25 (66%) experienced relapse after previous HSCTs.
- With a median follow-up of 14 months, the 12-month OS rate was 84%, the EFS rate was 69%, and the stringent EFS rate was 41%.
- Feasibility, outcomes, and toxicity were comparable with those of older children.
5. A subsequent study from the University of Pennsylvania reported the 3-year updated results of the global phase II [ELIANA (NCT02435849)](/clinicaltrials/NCT02435849) trial that included 79 patients who were treated with tisagenlecleucel.[[182](#cit/section_10.182)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The overall remission rate was 82% at 3 months.
- With a median follow-up of 38.8 months, the median duration of remission of the 66 patients with a complete response has not been reached. The estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 58% at 24 months and 52% at 36 months.
- Of the 32 patients in CR who received no additional therapy, the estimated RFS rate was 81% at 24 months and 76% at 36 months.
6. A report from the Pediatric Oncology Branch at the NCI described the use of a different CD19-targeted CAR T-cell product with a CD28 costimulatory domain that used a retroviral vector for gene transduction.[[178](#cit/section_10.178)]

- This CD19-CAR T-cell product induced complete responses in 70% of patients (14 of 20) (aged 1–30 years) with relapsed/refractory B-ALL.
- Persistence of CAR T cells in this study was 1 to 2 months, with recovery of normal B-cell lymphopoiesis in patients who achieved CR.
- In a subsequent follow-up study of 50 children and young adults who were treated with CD19-CAR T cells, 21 patients achieved an MRD-negative CR and received an allogeneic HSCT. In these 21 patients, the median OS was 70.2 months, and the 5-year EFS rate was 61.9%.[[183](#cit/section_10.183)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
7. Another report described a multicenter trial of 25 children and young adults who were treated with anti-CD19, anti-CD28z CAR T cells. Investigators increased the dose of lymphodepleting cyclophosphamide during the trial and analyzed outcomes on the basis of low-dose and high-dose preconditioning, as well as the presence of MRD versus morphological evidence of disease before treatment.[[184](#cit/section_10.184)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- All toxicities were reversible, including 16% of patients with severe cytokine release syndrome and 28% of patients with severe neurotoxicity.
- The overall complete response rate was 75%, and 89% of patients in CR were MRD negative.
- The response rate was superior in the high-dose cyclophosphamide cohort than in the low-dose cohort (94% vs. 38%); the response rate was higher in the MRD cohort than in the morphological disease cohort (93% vs. 50%).
- Of 18 responding patients, 15 underwent consolidative HSCT.
- Improvement in OS only occurred in patients who received the higher dose of cyclophosphamide conditioning.
8. In an effort to overcome early loss of functional CD19-targeted CAR T cells, a humanized 4-1BB approach was tested in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL or B-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Patients were treated in two cohorts: (1) patients without previous CAR T-cell exposure (CAR-naïve group) and (2) patients with previous CAR exposure who did not respond to more standard CARs, based on mouse-derived antibodies (re-treated group).[[185](#cit/section_10.185)]

- CR was achieved in 98% of CAR-naïve patients and 64% of re-treated patients.
- At 6 months, of those who responded, 27% of CAR-naïve patients and 48% of re-treated patients lost CAR persistence.
- For CAR-naive patients, the RFS rate was 84% (95% CI, 72%–97%) at 12 months and 74% (95% CI, 60%–90%) at 24 months.
- For the re-treatment cohort, the RFS rate was 74% (95% CI, 56%–97%) at 12 months and 58% (95% CI, 37%–90%) at 24 months.
- While these results appear favorable, they were not directly compared to currently approved CAR T cells.

###### CD19-targeted CAR T-cell treatment for CNS and other extramedullary disease

Although there are concerns that the treatment of patients with CNS disease could increase risk of neurotoxicity associated with CAR T-cell therapy, recent studies have shown that patients with CNS disease who undergo CAR T-cell therapy have similar outcomes to those without CNS disease, with no increase in severe immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).[[186](#cit/section_10.186),[187](#cit/section_10.187)]

Evidence (CAR T-cell therapy for patients with CNS disease):

1. Active CNS disease at relapse and/or infusion.

1. A single-center report analyzed 195 sequential patients treated with 4-1BB CD19-targeted CAR T cells, 66 of whom had CNS disease (43 with isolated CNS disease, 23 with combined bone marrow/CNS disease).[[186](#cit/section_10.186)]

- Overall, there was no difference in remission rates and progression-free survival rates with or without CNS disease.
- Patients with isolated CNS involvement had an RFS rate at 2 years of 66% (95% CI, 52%–82%), compared with 58% (95% CI, 50%–68%) for patients with bone marrow involvement (*P* = .15).
- Ninety-eight percent of patients were treated before their infusion for their CNS disease and reached CNS1 or CNS2 status at the time of CAR T-cell treatment. Patients with symptomatic/progressive CNS disease were not treated until the disease was controlled and stable.
2. A retrospective report examined the outcomes of 184 patients who were treated with tisagenlecleucel at 15 U.S. institutions. In this series, patients were referred for CAR T-cell infusion for marrow-only disease (n = 129), CNS disease (n = 40; either isolated [n = 23] or combined marrow/CNS disease [n = 17]), and non-CNS EMD (n = 15; 6 patients with isolated EMD and 9 with marrow involvement). All but one patient with CNS disease received tisagenlecleucel after one or more relapses (none had previously underwent transplant), whereas 29 of the marrow-only patients (22%) received infusions in first CR, 10 of whom (7.8%) had previously underwent transplant.[[187](#cit/section_10.187)]

- In patients referred to receive tisagenlecleucel for CNS disease (n = 40), 31 (78%) were already CNS-negative at the time of infusion, and 88% (35 of 40) were in CR at day 28 after infusion. For patients with non-CNS EMD, 10 of 15 (66%) were in CR at day 28.
- The 12-month RFS rate was 59.4% for patients with marrow-only disease, 59.4% for patients with CNS disease (isolated or combined), and 50% for those with non-CNS EMD (isolated or combined) (*P* = .92).
- In the CNS-disease cohort, there was no significant difference in 12-month RFS between patients with isolated CNS disease and those with combined CNS and marrow disease (*P* = .63).
- Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity was observed in 3 of 40 patients (7.5%) in the CNS-disease cohort, compared with 9 of 129 patients (7%) with marrow-only disease. None of the patients with active CNS disease at the time of infusion experienced grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.
3. A second multicenter report reviewed 55 patients with relapses involving the CNS (isolated or combined with bone marrow) who were treated with either a CD28-based institutional CAR (n = 12) or tisagenlecleucel (4-1BB vector, n = 43).[[188](#cit/section_10.188)]

- Remission was achieved in 92% of children who received CD28-based CAR T cells and 93% of children who received 4-1BB–based CAR T cells.
- Of 11 children who received CD28-based CAR T cells and achieved a CR, 9 underwent HSCT. Seven of these nine patients survived relapse free.
- None of the 40 patients who were treated with the 4-1BB–based CAR T cells (tisagenlecleucel) and achieved a CR had a planned HSCT. Nineteen of these patients experienced relapses, 12 of whom had CNS relapses.
- Patients who received tisagenlecleucel for an isolated CNS relapse had a high incidence of subsequent CNS relapse (6 of 8 patients).
2. For non-CNS EMD, available data are limited.

1. The report of 195 patients above compared CNS EMD, non-CNS EMD, and bone marrow–only disease. No differences in OS and RFS were noted between the groups.[[186](#cit/section_10.186)]
2. In contrast, a large retrospective analysis found that active EMD at infusion was independently associated with worse EFS (HR, 1.9; *P* = .01).[[189](#cit/section_10.189)]
3. A separate analysis found that in 15 patients with non-CNS EMD, 10 achieved a CR, and 6 of the 10 patients subsequently relapsed. Consequently, only 4 of 15 patients remained event-free during the follow-up period.[[187](#cit/section_10.187)]
4. A retrospective analysis from the NCI identified limitations in eradication of non-CNS EMD with CAR T cells, despite concurrent marrow responses, highlighting the important role of positron emission tomography scans for monitoring.[[190](#cit/section_10.190)]

###### Risk factors associated with CD19-targeted CAR T-cell failure

Initial trials that used CAR T-cell therapy demonstrated that a very high proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory disease achieved CR, regardless of white blood cell count, cytogenetics,[[191](#cit/section_10.191)] number of prior therapies, chemotherapy responsiveness, or other traditional factors associated with chemotherapy responsiveness. Subsequent studies have identified the following factors that are associated with poor long-term responses in patients who achieve initial CRs after CAR T-cell infusions:

1. Tumor burden at the time of CAR T-cell infusion.

1. A single-center study assessed bone marrow blast percentage immediately before CAR T-cell infusion (after lymphodepleting chemotherapy). High tumor burden (HTB) was defined as 40% blasts or more, and low tumor burden (LTB) was defined as less than 40% blasts.[[173](#cit/section_10.173)]

- In the HTB cohort of patients (n = 15), the best ORR was 87%, and the MRD-negative CR rate was 80%.
- In the LTB cohort of patients (n = 55), the best ORR was 100%, and all responders were MRD negative.
- Among HTB patients, the probability of continued remission was 49% (95% CI, 27%–88%) at 12 months and 39% (95% CI, 19%–82%) at 24 months.
- Among LTB patients, the probability of continued remission was 86% (95% CI, 77%–96%) at 12 months and 78% (95% CI, 67%–91%) at 24 months.
2. A study of 420 patients assessed the risk factors associated with long-term survival.[[189](#cit/section_10.189)]

- On multivariate analysis, a disease burden of 5% or higher, noted by bone marrow flow cytometry before starting lymphodepleting chemotherapy, was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.52 (95% CI, 1.86–3.41) for inferior EFS, compared with patients who had a lower disease burden.
3. In a study of 180 patients who received tisagenlecleucel infusions, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high-disease burden (>5% bone marrow blasts, CNS3 disease [defined as cerebrospinal fluid specimen with ≥5 white blood cells/μL with lymphoblasts and/or the presence of cranial nerve palsies], or non-CNS extramedullary disease [EMD]) was associated with inferior outcomes.[[192](#cit/section_10.192)]

- Patients with a high-disease burden had poorer outcomes (12-month OS rate, 58%; EFS rate, 31%) than patients with a low-disease burden (12-month OS rate, 85%; EFS rate, 70%) and patients with undetectable disease (12-month OS rate, 95%; EFS rate, 72%; *P* < .0001 for OS and EFS).
2. Previous failure to respond to blinatumomab.

1. In a study of 420 pediatric and young adult patients with ALL who were treated with CD19-targeted CAR T cells, the following results were reported:[[189](#cit/section_10.189)]

- Patients who had previously failed to respond to blinatumomab before CAR T-cell therapy had lower CR rates after CAR T-cell therapy (20 of 31, 64.5%) compared with previous responders to blinatumomab (39 of 42, 92.9%) or blinatumomab-naïve patients (317 of 339, 93.5%; *P* < .0001).
- Blinatumomab nonresponders had worse 6-month EFS rates (27.3%; 95% CI, 13.6%–43.0%) than blinatumomab responders (66.9%; 95% CI, 50.6%–78.9%; *P* < .0001) or blinatumomab-naïve patients (72.6%; 95% CI, 67.5%–77%; *P* < .0001).
3. Persistent B-cell aplasia and next-generation sequencing of MRD (NGS-MRD).

1. Early studies recognized that B-cell aplasia was a functional measurement of CD19-targeted CAR T-cell persistence, and that loss of B-cell aplasia within the first few months of treatment resulted in high rates of relapse.[[171](#cit/section_10.171)] However, it is an imperfect measurement because CD19-negative relapse can occur despite persistent B-cell aplasia. NGS-MRD techniques rely on clonal rearrangements in the IgH or TCR sequences in lymphoblasts, which typically persist even when CD19 surface expression is lost.
2. To define the risk of relapse, one study assessed B-cell aplasia and NGS-MRD in bone marrow over time in 143 patients who received tisagenlecleucel.[[193](#cit/section_10.193)]

- Multivariate analysis at day 28 showed independent associations of NGS-MRD greater than 0 (HR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18–10.8; *P* < .001) and loss of B-cell aplasia (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44–7.69; *P* = .005) with relapse.
- By 3 months, the NGS-MRD HR increased to 12 (95% CI, 2.87–50; *P* < .001), whereas loss of B-cell aplasia was not independently predictive (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.33–4.79; *P* = .7).
- Early loss of B-cell aplasia was more predictive of relapse than a later loss of B-cell aplasia.
- Loss of B-cell aplasia in the first 6 months led to an EFS rate lower than 20%; however, patients who lost B-cell aplasia at 1 year had an EFS rate of 75%.
- Notably, NGS-MRD positivity occurring at any time after CAR T-cell therapy led to a very high risk of relapse.
4. CAR T-cell dose.

1. A retrospective multicenter study reviewed the doses of CD19-targeted CAR T cells (tisagenlecleucel) given per kilogram by quartiles and assessed patient outcomes.[[194](#cit/section_10.194)]

- Patients who received the highest quartile dose had improved OS (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08–0.61), EFS (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12–0.49), and RFS (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.07–0.49), compared with those who received the lowest quartile dose.
- Higher doses of CAR T cells were not associated with additional toxicities.
- A potential confounding factor was the significantly higher number of patients with favorable cytogenetics who received the highest quartile dose.
- Further research is warranted to elucidate the relationship between threshold dosing and post-CAR T-cell therapy outcomes for tisagenlecleucel.
5. Timing of relapse after HSCT before treatment with CD19-targeted CAR T cells.

1. A retrospective study reported the outcomes of 81 patients with multiply relapsed or primary refractory B-ALL who were treated with tisagenlecleucel. Eighty percent of these patients had previously underwent allogeneic HSCT.[[195](#cit/section_10.195)]

- Seventy-one of 81 patients (87.7%) were in remission at day 28 after CAR T-cell therapy.
- At 2 years after CAR T-cell therapy, the EFS rate was 45.3%, and the OS rate was 53.2%.
- Of the patients who previously underwent transplant, time to relapse after HSCT was a significant predictor of outcome when receiving tisagenlecleucel. Patients who had relapsed within 6 months of allogeneic HSCT had an EFS rate of 18.4%, compared with 55.5% for those who relapsed 6 months or more after HSCT.

###### Relapse or failure to respond after CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy

Retrospective studies have described outcomes and assessed factors associated with survival after relapse in patients who received CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy:

1. A study looked at 166 relapses occurring after CAR T-cell therapy using either 4-1BB or CD28 costimulatory domains.[[196](#cit/section_10.196)]

- Eighty-three patients (50%) were CD19 positive, 68 (41%) were CD19 negative, and 12 (7.2%) had lineage switch relapses.
- The median OS was 11.9 months (95% CI, 9–17 months), with no difference between CD19-positive and CD19-negative relapses.
- Patients with lineage switch relapses had a dismal prognosis, with no long-term survivors.
- CD19-positive relapses were associated with a greater prior treatment burden, shown by a greater number of previous remissions.
- CD19-negative relapses were associated with a greater pre-CAR T-cell infusion disease burden, prior nonresponse to blinatumomab, older age, and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain.
- Lineage switch relapses were associated with the presence of *KMT2A* rearrangements.
2. A second study reviewed 80 patients (27 nonresponders and 53 who relapsed) who received 4-1BB-based CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy that failed to produce remissions.[[197](#cit/section_10.197)]

- Of the nonresponders, 95% had high disease burden (>5% blasts) before CAR T-cell infusion.
- CD19-negative relapses were associated with a decreased OS rate at 1 year, compared with CD19-positive relapses (30% [95% CI, 14%–66%] vs. 68% [49%–92%]; *P* = .0068).
- Only treatment followed by HSCT if remission was obtained was associated with long-term survival.

###### Prevention of relapse or failure after CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy

Investigators have examined several strategies to prevent relapse after initial CAR T-cell infusions. These strategies include repeating CAR T-cell infusions for various indications and risk groups, giving maintenance chemotherapy, and infusing a different type of CAR T cell.[[185](#cit/section_10.185),[198](#cit/section_10.198)]

1. Second infusion of the first CAR T cells.

1. A retrospective study from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia analyzed the outcomes of 81 repeat CAR T-cell infusions (CARTr) for three indications: (1) relapse prevention in at-risk patients (peripheral B-cell recovery [BCR] or emergence of CD19-positive hematogones), (2) CD19-positive MRD emergence or relapse, and (3) failure to go into remission after initial CAR T-cell infusion.[[199](#cit/section_10.199)]

- Of 63 patients who received CARTr for relapse prevention, 52% achieved CR (BCR, 15 of 40 [38%]; hematogones, 18 of 23 [78%]).

- Lymphodepletion was associated with response to CARTr for BCR (odds ratio [OR], 33.57; *P* = .015) but not hematogones (OR, 0.30; *P* = .291).
- The cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% at 24 months for CR, compared with 61% for nonresponse to CARTr (*P* = .259).
- For MRD/relapse, the CR rate after CARTr was 50% (5 of 10). However, no CRs were observed in the eight patients who had their initial CAR T-cell infusion fail.

###### Previous allogeneic donor–derived CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy

Certain patients may not be amenable to producing autologous CD19-directed CAR T cells, such as those with very early relapse after HSCT. CAR T-cell therapy using cells produced from the donor of a given patient who is post-HSCT may be an option for these patients. A small group of patients who relapsed after HSCT received allogeneic CD19-directed CAR T cells that were produced from T cells obtained from donors.[[200](#cit/section_10.200)] All 13 patients obtained an MRD-negative bone marrow CR, with 83% CR at extramedullary sites. Three patients underwent a subsequent HSCT. At a median follow-up of 12 months, eight patients remained in bone marrow CR. There was only one case of acute GVHD. These results provide preliminary evidence for the safety and efficacy of using CAR T cells produced from their previous allogeneic donor in the setting of relapsed ALL.

###### The role of consolidative HSCT after CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy for ALL

Studies of second-generation CD19-targeted CAR T-cell approaches have shown that constructs using CD28-based costimulatory molecules result in a relatively short half-life of CAR T cells. This short half-life leads to very high rates of relapse unless HSCT is done soon after recovery from CAR T-cell toxicities. Therefore, treatments with CD28-targeted CAR T cells are considered bridging therapies, and HSCT is generally planned for eligible patients 4 to 8 weeks after the CAR T-cell procedure. Tisagenlecleucel and other CARs with 4-1BB costimulatory molecules have been shown to have significant levels of persistence, leading to long-term remission in 45% to 50% of patients without additional therapy. Up to 80% of relapses occur during the first year after CAR T-cell therapy and there is a window of deep remission. Because of this finding, some study groups have argued for planned HSCT during remission early after CAR T-cell infusion, either in all patients or in patients who have not had a previous HSCT. No randomized trials have addressed this issue, but some studies have addressed this question retrospectively.

Evidence (consolidative HSCT after CAR T-cell therapy):

1. CD28 CAR T-cell bridging approach.

1. A study examined 50 children and young adults who were treated with CD28-based CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.[[183](#cit/section_10.183)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Twenty-one patients achieved an MRD-negative CR and underwent an allogeneic HSCT. In these 21 patients, the median OS was 70.2 months, and the 5-year EFS rate was 61.9%.
2. 4-1BB CARs with varying approaches to HSCT.

1. A study of 50 patients eligible for HSCT after 4-1BB-based CAR T-cell therapy reported the following results ([PLAT-02 [NCT02028455]](/clinicaltrials/NCT02028455) trial):[[201](#cit/section_10.201)]

- Patients who lost CAR T-cell function before 63 days after therapy had improved LFS if they underwent HSCT, compared with those who did not undergo HSCT (*P* = .01).
- Patients with no prior history of HSCT had an improved LFS with a planned HSCT, with a trend toward significance (*P* = .09). This benefit was not evident in the 34 patients with a history of prior HSCT (*P* = .45).
3. 4-1BB CARs followed by an intent to perform HSCT.

1. In a study from China of 52 children who received either CD19- or CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy and underwent a planned HSCT at a median of 50 days after CAR T-cell infusion (range, 34–98 days; 48 MRD-negative and 4 MRD-positive patients at time of HSCT), the following results were reported:[[202](#cit/section_10.202)]

- The 1-year EFS rate was 73%, and the 1-year OS rate was 87.7%.
- Although the survival rate of patients eligible to proceed to HSCT in remission was high, the analysis did not include patients who had a previous HSCT, patients who did not achieve remission with CAR T-cell infusions, and patients who were not eligible for HSCT after CAR T-cell therapy.

##### CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy

At least 50% of relapses after CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy have occurred because of antigen escape, which has been shown to be related to mutations in the CD19 protein that delete the binding sites used by CAR T-cell constructs.[[203](#cit/section_10.203)] Salvage after antigen escape has been documented with cell and immune therapy approaches targeting a second lymphoid antigen, CD22. Studies looking specifically at inotuzumab rescue of CD19-negative relapse have not been published, but two groups have reported high rates of subsequent achievement of remission and survival, generally when CD22 CAR T-cell therapy is followed by HSCT therapy.[[204](#cit/section_10.204),[205](#cit/section_10.205)]; [[206](#cit/section_10.206)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]; [[202](#cit/section_10.202)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Because the CD22 antigen can be downregulated, there is concern about targeting CD22 alone for long-term CAR T-cell response; consequently, this approach is often paired with HSCT.

Evidence (CD22-targeted CAR T-cell therapy):

1. Investigators at the NCI reported a phase I/II trial of 58 children and young adults treated with a CD22-targeted CAR T-cell approach.[[207](#cit/section_10.207)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Of the 55 patients with ALL who were infused, 40 achieved CRs (73%); 88% of those patients achieved MRD-negative remissions.
- Although 86% of patients experienced cytokine release syndrome, 90% experienced grades 1 to 2 cytokine release syndrome.
- Thirty-three percent of patients experienced neurotoxicity, all of which were grades 1 or 2, except in one patient who experienced an intracranial hemorrhage.
- Thirty-eight percent of patients had an HLH/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)–like syndrome that sometimes required management with anakinra.
- Patients who received CD22-targeted therapy with inotuzumab or CD22 CAR T-cell therapy before this therapy had lower rates of CD22 expression, were less likely to achieve remission, and had shorter duration of remission.
- Thirty of the 40 patients (75%) who achieved CRs relapsed; only patients who proceeded to HSCT had long-term remissions (14 patients proceeded to HSCT, 6 relapsed). The median RFS was 6 months for this group of patients who achieved CRs.
2. A Chinese group treated 34 patients who had failed previous CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy with CD22-targeted CAR T cells.[[205](#cit/section_10.205)]

- CR occurred in 80% of the patients evaluable at day 30 (71% of all patients).
- Seven patients received no further therapy, and three patients remained in remission at 5 to 13 months after therapy.
- Eleven patients went on to HSCT, with a 1-year LFS rate of 72%.
- This study demonstrated that long-term salvage of patients failing CD19-targeted CAR T cells can occur with CD22-targeted CAR T cells plus HSCT.

##### Multiantigen targeted CAR T-cell therapy

Investigators have tested approaches aimed at targeting multiple ALL antigens to overcome relapse caused by immune escape. Studies have included the following approaches:

1. Use of two independently manufactured CAR T cells targeted at different antigens infused simultaneously or sequentially.
2. A single manufacturing process of CAR T cells that contain two populations of cells, each targeted at a different antigen.
3. A single manufacturing process where one CAR construct has binding domains to multiple antigens.

While none of these approaches are commercially available, studies of this approach are ongoing.

A large study included Chinese patients who received a 1:1 mix of independently manufactured CD19- and CD22-targeted CAR T cells. This treatment produced remission in 99% of patients. Persistent B-cell aplasia at 6 months and HSCT after CAR T cells were each associated with improved survival.[[208](#cit/section_10.208)]

A second study in China infused CD19-targeted CAR T cells followed by CD22-targeted T cells after achieving remission. This resulted in an 18-month EFS rate of 80%, with HSCT occurring in only 10% of patients.[[209](#cit/section_10.209)]

Three additional trials examined single manufacturing processes of multitargeted CAR T cells. Treatment with this type of CAR T cells resulted in reasonable rates of remission. However, the duration of CAR T cells was poor, and patient outcomes were no better with this CAR T-cell therapy than outcomes with commercial CD19-targeted CAR T cells.[[210](#cit/section_10.210)-[212](#cit/section_10.212)]

### Treatment of Isolated Extramedullary Relapse

With improved success in treating children with ALL, the incidence of
isolated extramedullary relapse has decreased. The incidence of isolated
CNS relapse is less than 5%, and testicular relapse is less than 1% to 2%.[[213](#cit/section_10.213)-[215](#cit/section_10.215)] As with bone marrow and mixed relapses, time from initial diagnosis to relapse is a key prognostic factor in isolated extramedullary relapses.[[216](#cit/section_10.216)] In addition, age older than 6 years at relapse was noted in one study as an adverse prognostic factor for patients with an isolated extramedullary relapse, while a second study suggested age 10 years as a better cutoff.[[17](#cit/section_10.17),[217](#cit/section_10.217)] Of note, in most children with isolated extramedullary relapses, submicroscopic marrow disease can be demonstrated using sensitive molecular techniques,[[218](#cit/section_10.218)] and successful treatment strategies must effectively control both local and systemic disease. Patients with an isolated CNS relapse who show greater than 0.01% MRD in a morphologically normal marrow have a worse prognosis (5-year EFS rate, 30%) than do patients with either no MRD or MRD less than 0.01% (5-year EFS rate, 60%).[[218](#cit/section_10.218)]

#### Isolated CNS relapse

Standard treatment options for childhood ALL that has recurred in the CNS include the following:

1. Systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy.
2. Cranial or craniospinal radiation.
3. HSCT.
4. CAR T-cell therapy for isolated CNS disease that is multiply relapsed.

While
the prognosis for children with isolated CNS relapse had been quite poor in the
past, aggressive systemic and intrathecal therapy followed by cranial or craniospinal
radiation has improved the outlook, particularly for patients who did not
receive cranial radiation during their first remission.[[19](#cit/section_10.19),[216](#cit/section_10.216),[219](#cit/section_10.219),[220](#cit/section_10.220)]

Evidence (chemotherapy and radiation therapy):

1. In a Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study using this strategy, children
who had not previously received radiation therapy and whose initial remission was 18 months or longer had a 4-year EFS rate of approximately 80%,
compared with EFS rates of approximately 45% for children with CNS relapse within
18 months of diagnosis.[[216](#cit/section_10.216)]
2. In a follow-up POG study, children who had not previously received radiation therapy and who had an initial remission of 18 months or more were treated with intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy for 1 year followed by 18 Gy of cranial radiation only.[[19](#cit/section_10.19)]

- The 4-year EFS rate was 78%. Children with an initial remission of less than 18 months also received the same chemotherapy but had craniospinal radiation (24 Gy cranial/15 Gy spinal) as in the first POG study and achieved a 4-year EFS rate of 52%.
3. The Children’s Oncology Group [AALL02P2 (NCT00096135)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00096135) study enrolled 118 eligible children with B-ALL and late isolated CNS relapse. Patients received intensified systemic therapy, triple intrathecal chemotherapy, and 12 Gy of cranial irradiation delivered at 12 months, with maintenance chemotherapy continuing until 104 weeks postdiagnosis.[[221](#cit/section_10.221)]

- The 3-year EFS rate was 64.3% (± 4.5%), and the OS rate was 79.6% (± 3.8%).
- Second relapses that included the CNS occurred in 46.1% of patients (18 of 39).
- Of the 112 patients who completed therapy, 78 received protocol-specified radiation therapy.
- Study enrollment was closed after interim monitoring analysis showed inferior EFS compared with the POG 9412 study, in which patients received 18 Gy of cranial radiation. Thus, the lower dose of cranial radiation was deemed to be inadequate.

A number of case series describing HSCT in the treatment of isolated CNS relapse have been published.[[222](#cit/section_10.222),[223](#cit/section_10.223)] Although some reports have suggested a possible role for HSCT for patients with isolated CNS disease with very early relapse and T-cell disease, there is less evidence for the need for HSCT in early isolated CNS relapse in B-cell disease, and no evidence in late relapse. In the COG AALL0433 study, patients with B-ALL and a very early isolated CNS relapse were treated with either intensive chemotherapy with cranial radiation or allogeneic HSCT after second CR was achieved, depending on availability of donors and physician decisions. A small number of patients proceeded to HSCT (n = 7), which was associated with more favorable DFS and OS, compared with patients who continued on chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[[31](#cit/section_10.31)]

Evidence (HSCT):

1. A retrospective, registry-based study compared the outcome of patients treated with either HLA-matched sibling transplants or chemoradiation therapy as in the POG studies above.[[224](#cit/section_10.224)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] This study included transplant of both early (<18 months from diagnosis) and late relapses.

- The 8-year probabilities of LFS adjusted for age (58%) and duration of first remission (66%) were similar.
- Because of the relatively good outcome of patients with isolated CNS relapse more than 18 months from diagnosis who were treated with chemoradiation therapy alone (>75%), transplant is generally not recommended by the COG for this group.
2. The MRC ALLR3 trial tested intensive induction with mitoxantrone versus idarubicin in relapsed ALL patients, defining a superior outcome when mitoxantrone was used. A subanalysis of 80 patients entering the trial with isolated CNS relapse included 13 patients with very early relapse (defined as <18 months from first diagnosis), 55 patients with early relapse (defined as >18 months from initial diagnosis but within 6 months of being off therapy), and 12 patients with late relapse.[[17](#cit/section_10.17)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Patients with late relapse did very well with chemotherapy/cranial radiation therapy, with 11 of 12 patients surviving.
- Allogeneic HSCT was recommended for very early and early relapse. Sixty-six patients were alive and relapse free after the planned three induction courses. Fifty-four patients with early and very early isolated CNS relapse were eligible for protocol-recommended HSCT, and 39 patients (72%) received HSCT. Twenty-one percent of these patients relapsed, compared with a relapse rate of 71% in the group that did not receive HSCT.
- Of those eligible for transplant, treatment with mitoxantrone rather than idarubicin during reinduction was associated with a survival advantage (3-year progression-free survival rates, 61% vs. 21%; *P* = .027). As in the larger trial, the major advantage from the mitoxantrone arm occurred in those who received HSCT. Small patient numbers in the very early group prohibited detailed analysis of this cohort, and rates of failure within the early group treated with chemotherapy/cranial radiation therapy were inferior to other published experiences, calling into question this chemotherapy approach for early isolated CNS relapse patients.

Evidence (CAR T-cell therapy for isolated CNS disease that is multiply relapsed):

CAR T cells have been shown to penetrate the CNS and lead to high rates of remission in patients with CNS disease with or without marrow involvement. A small number of studies have addressed the relationship of CNS involvement with CAR T-cell therapy outcomes.

1. A single-center study reported on 195 sequential patients treated with 4-1BB CD19-targeted CAR T cells, 66 of whom had CNS disease (43 with isolated CNS disease, 23 with combined BM/CNS disease).[[186](#cit/section_10.186)]

- Overall, there was no difference in remission rates and progression-free survival in patients with or without CNS disease.
- Of the patients with CNS disease, 79% were second or greater relapse.
- Patients with isolated CNS involvement had an RFS rate at 2 years of 66% (95% CI, 52%–82%), compared with 58% (95% CI, 50%–68%) for patients with bone marrow involvement (*P* = .15).

#### Isolated testicular relapse

The results of treatment of isolated testicular
relapse depend on the timing of the relapse. The 3-year EFS rate of boys with overt testicular relapse during therapy is approximately
40%; it is approximately 85% for boys with late testicular relapse.[[225](#cit/section_10.225)]

Standard treatment options in North America for childhood ALL that has recurred in the testes include the following:

1. Chemotherapy.
2. Radiation therapy.

Standard approaches for treating isolated testicular relapse in North America include local radiation therapy along with intensive chemotherapy. In some European clinical trial groups, orchiectomy of the involved testicle is performed instead of radiation. Biopsy of the other testicle is performed at the time of relapse to determine if additional local control (surgical removal or radiation) is to be performed. A
study that looked at testicular biopsy at the end of frontline therapy failed to
demonstrate a survival benefit for patients with early detection of occult
disease.[[226](#cit/section_10.226)]

There are limited clinical data concerning outcome without the use of radiation therapy or orchiectomy. Treatment protocols that have tested this approach have incorporated intensified dosing of chemotherapy agents (e.g., high-dose methotrexate) that may be able to achieve antileukemic levels in the testes.

Evidence (treatment of testicular relapse):

1. The [COG AALL02P2 (NCT00096135)](/clinicaltrials/NCT00096135) trial tested whether radiation therapy could be eliminated for patients with late isolated testicular relapse (occurring more than 18 months from diagnosis).[[227](#cit/section_10.227)] On this trial, testicular size was reassessed after the initial month of reinduction chemotherapy, which included high-dose methotrexate. If the testicle remained enlarged, biopsy was performed, and if positive, patients were to be treated with local radiation therapy. Those with testes that normalized in size or who had negative biopsies were to be treated without radiation therapy. Postinduction chemotherapy for all patients (whether or not they were irradiated) included multiple courses of high-dose methotrexate.[[228](#cit/section_10.228)]

- Of 40 patients enrolled, 26 had persistent testicular enlargement after reinduction. Testicular biopsy was positive in 12 of these 26 patients, 11 of whom received testicular radiation therapy; all other patients on the trial were treated without radiation.
- Participants who received testicular radiation therapy achieved a 5-year EFS rate of 73% versus 61% for those who did not receive radiation (*P* = .6); the 5-year OS rate was 73% for those who received testicular radiation versus 71% (*P* = .9) for those who did not receive testicular radiation.
- Thus, for patients with isolated testicular relapse achieving a favorable response after initial induction (documented by size reduction and/or biopsy), omission of testicular radiation therapy may be a feasible option.
2. Dutch investigators treated five boys with a late testicular relapse with high-dose methotrexate during induction (12 g/m2) and at regular intervals during the remainder of therapy (6 g/m2) without testicular radiation.[[227](#cit/section_10.227)]

- All five boys were long-term survivors.
3. In a small series of boys who had an isolated testicular relapse after an HSCT for a prior systemic relapse of ALL, five of seven boys had extended EFS without a second HSCT.[[161](#cit/section_10.161)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

### Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Relapsed Childhood ALL

#### Trials for ALL in first relapse

Information about NCI-supported clinical trials can be found on the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search"). For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the [ClinicalTrials.gov website](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/").

#### Trials for ALL in second or subsequent relapse or refractory ALL

Multiple clinical trials investigating new agents and new combinations of agents are available for children with second or subsequent relapsed or refractory ALL and should be considered. These trials are testing targeted treatments specific for ALL, including monoclonal antibody–based therapies and drugs that inhibit signal transduction pathways required for leukemia cell growth and survival. Multiple clinical trials investigating new agents, new combinations of agents, and immunotherapeutic approaches are available. For more information, see the [ClinicalTrials.gov website](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/").

## Latest Updates to This Summary (04/21/2025)

The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
new information becomes available. This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above.

**[General Information About Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1)**

Added Elitzur et al. as [reference 17](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_644).

**[Risk-Based Treatment Assignment](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_22)**

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1783) to state that in one study by the Dutch Children's Oncology Group, patients with low but detectable end-of-consolidation minimal residual disease (MRD) fared as well as those with nondetectable MRD at this time point, if their subsequent MRD assessments were negative. However, these patients did poorly if their subsequent MRD assessments remained detectable by the polymerase chain reaction assay (cited Stutterheim et al. as reference 140).

**[Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_727)**

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1135) to state that the Japanese Childhood Cancer Group ALL-B12 trial included 1,107 patients with standard-risk B-ALL. Patients were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy, either with or without every 4-week vincristine/dexamethasone pulses. There was no difference in event-free survival or adverse events between the two treatment groups (cited Kato et al. as reference 125).

Added [Allopurinol for mercaptopurine (6-MP) toxicity](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2744) as a new subsection.

**[Central Nervous System (CNS)-Directed Therapy for Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_576)**

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2708) to state that investigators have examined whether exposure to anesthetic agents affects neurocognition in children who undergo treatment for ALL. Also added text about the results of two studies that examined the association between anesthesia exposure and neurocognitive outcomes in children with and survivors of ALL (cited Alexander et al. and Banerjee et al. as references 43 and 44, respectively). Also added text to state that the long-term implication of these findings awaits longer follow-up.

**[Treatment of Relapsed Childhood ALL](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1205)**

Added Rheingold et al. as [reference 15](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1207).

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1210) to state that in one study by the Children's Oncology Group (COG), there was no difference in postrelapse survival between isolated marrow and combined marrow/extramedullary relapses in T-ALL or infant B-ALL. However, for noninfant patients with B-ALL, combined relapses were associated with a better outcome, compared with isolated marrow relapses.

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1209) to state that in general, patients whose relapses occur earlier after initial diagnosis fare worse than those who experience later relapses.

Revised [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1348) to state that age 10 years and older at initial diagnosis and at relapse have been reported as independent predictors of poor outcome. A COG study demonstrated that patients aged 10 to 15 years at initial diagnosis had inferior outcomes compared with patients aged 1 to 9 years, and those older than age 15 years did even worse.

Revised [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2225) to state that in a study from the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster group that included patients with B-ALL who were diagnosed at age 18 years or younger and experienced a late relapse, age at initial diagnosis was not a significant predictor of subsequent outcome when analyzed by quartiles.

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2750) to state that cytogenetic aberrations have been shown to be significant prognostic factors in B-ALL.

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2751) about the results of a study of 2,053 patients with ALL who were initially treated in COG studies and subsequently experienced a relapse, which showed that several recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities were significant predictors of overall survival (OS).

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2752) to state that other studies have also demonstrated that patients with *ETV6*::*RUNX1* gene fusions have a more favorable prognosis after relapse.

Revised [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_1354) to state that patients with T-ALL tend to experience earlier relapses than noninfant patients with B-ALL. In a study from the COG, the median time to relapse was 13.8 months for patients with T-ALL, compared with 34.6 months for noninfant patients with B-ALL. The 5-year postrelapse OS rate was only 35% for those with T-ALL, compared with 52.5% for noninfant patients with B-ALL. Patients with T-ALL are less likely to achieve a second remission after relapse than those with B-ALL.

Added [text](/types/leukemia/hp/child-all-treatment-pdq#_2595) to state that patients who received blinatumomab experienced much lower rates of toxicities such as mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis than patients who received standard chemotherapy. For example, 11% of patients who received standard chemotherapy developed sepsis, compared with less than 2% of patients who received blinatumomab. Similarly, febrile neutropenia occurred in 3% of patients who received blinatumomab, compared with 48% of those who received standard chemotherapy.
