**NOTE: There is either no new research on this topic or the recent published research is weak and not appropriate for inclusion in the summary. Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only.**

This [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information summary provides an overview of
the use of [Cancell/Cantron/Protocel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446542&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a treatment in people with cancer. The discussion in the
summary is limited to Cancell/Cantron/Protocel as it was originally conceived; the
"vibrationally tuned" distilled water also distributed under the name Cancell
will not be discussed.

This summary contains the following key information:

- Cancell/Cantron/Protocel has been promoted by its manufacturers as an effective
therapy for cancer and a number of other diseases.
- Cancell/Cantron/Protocel is a mixture of common chemicals, none of which is known
to be effective in treating any type of cancer.
- No [animal study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [human study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel has been published in
a peer-reviewed scientific journal to show that it is safe or effective in
treating cancer.
- Cancell/Cantron/Protocel is not approved by the [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for use in the United States as a treatment for a disease. There is a permanent injunction against distribution.

## General Information

[Cancell/Cantron/Protocel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446542&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), also known by the names Sheridan’s Formula, Jim’s Juice, JS-114, JS-101, 126-F, and the "Cancell-like" products [Cantron](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=457987&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [Protocel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=572363&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is a liquid that has been
produced in various forms principally by two manufacturers since the late
1930s.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)-[3](#cit/section_2.3)] It has been promoted as an effective therapy for
[cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and a wide range of other diseases including
[AIDS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[collagen disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44127&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[lupus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45477&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[scleroderma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44142&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[cystic fibrosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44128&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),

[Parkinson disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44140&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[hemophilia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44132&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[hypotension](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[hypertension](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44038&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and some forms of
[epilepsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44028&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and mental illness.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

The exact composition of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel is unknown. The [U.S. Food and
Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) has listed the components as
[inositol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44134&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[nitric acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44136&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[sodium sulfite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44101&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[potassium hydroxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44141&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[sulfuric acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44143&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and
[catechol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44098&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)] The
original manufacturer also identified "crocinic acid" as a component;[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] however, information about the nature and origin of this chemical has
not been provided, and it does not appear to be a known compound. An
independent analysis of one formulation of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel found 12 different
compounds, none of which is known to be effective in treating any form of
cancer.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

Before researchers can conduct [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) drug research in the United States,
they must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA.
Entelev, which is the original name of the mixture, was assigned an IND number
(IND #20258) by the FDA in 1982.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] The IND currently remains
inactive because information about the product’s composition and studies
showing its [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
effectiveness in animals have not been provided to the FDA.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] In
1989, the FDA was granted a permanent injunction against both principal
manufacturers of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel prohibiting them or their agents from
distributing the mixture, which was judged an unapproved new drug.

Cancell/Cantron/Protocel has been administered
[orally,](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [rectally,](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44083&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [topically](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] Topical skin application is accomplished by dampening a cotton
pad with the liquid and taping the moistened pad to the wrist or the ball of
the foot after first treating the area with
[dimethyl sulfoxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44097&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Cancer patients have also been advised to take
[bromelain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44125&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is a digestive aid, and to avoid high intakes of [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [C](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439435&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) while undergoing treatment with
Cancell/Cantron/Protocel.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

## History

[Cancell/Cantron/Protocel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446542&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was developed in the 1950s by a chemist who called it
Entelev and provided it free of charge to patients with [terminal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44178&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] In 1984, production was taken over by a second manufacturer who
distributed the mixture free of charge under the trademarked name Cancell to
individuals with cancer, [AIDS](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45950&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and other conditions.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

The two principal manufacturers of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel have offered somewhat
different explanations for cancer development, but their theories about how
the mixture works are quite similar. According to the original manufacturer, human [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be normal, cancerous, or primitive.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Each of these
cellular forms is distinguished by the degree of oxygen utilization in
[cellular metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44126&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Normal
cells use [aerobic metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43992&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
([glycolysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44131&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plus additional
[biochemical reactions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44124&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that
require oxygen) to produce the energy needed for growth and maintenance.
Primitive cells only use glycolysis, which is a much less
efficient way to produce energy. It was proposed that normal cells become
cancerous when, in response to certain damaging conditions such as chronic
energy stress (a demand for energy greater than the cell’s ability to produce
it), they reach a critical point and begin to rely mainly on glycolysis to
produce energy. According to this theory, cancerous cells still maintain many
of the features of normal cells and cannot be recognized by the body as
foreign. According to the original manufacturer, Cancell/Cantron/Protocel causes
cancer cells to become completely primitive, i.e., their residual aerobic
metabolism is inhibited and they produce energy solely by glycolysis. The
resulting primitive cells are then seen by the body as foreign and
destroyed. While the aerobic metabolism of normal cells is also inhibited
by Cancell/Cantron/Protocel, they are too far removed from the critical point to become
cancerous or completely primitive.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

The second manufacturer suggested that a [bacterium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called *Progenitor cryptocides* is
involved in cancer development.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] According to this theory, *P.
cryptocides* becomes activated in individuals whose bodies are damaged by an
improper [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Once activated, this bacterium helps cause damaged normal
cells to shift their energy production from aerobic metabolism to glycolysis.
When the demand for energy exceeds the damaged normal cell’s ability to
produce it, the cell [mutates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44133&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and becomes
cancerous. Once again, Cancell/Cantron/Protocel forces cancerous cells into a
completely primitive state where they self-digest and are replaced by
normal cells. The waste material produced by this self-digestion process is
discarded by the body in a variety of ways: in [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [stool](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46605&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
discharge, or perspiration; it may also be [vomited](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or coughed up.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

The idea that cancer cells show increased levels of glycolysis
compared with normal cells is widely accepted, but this change in [metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is not believed to be a
fundamental cause of cancer development.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)-[5](#cit/section_3.5)] In addition, there
is no scientific evidence that Cancell/Cantron/Protocel or any of its components can
cause cells to produce energy solely by glycolysis or is able to treat cancer
effectively.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[6](#cit/section_3.6)] Furthermore, there is no evidence to
support the existence of the bacterium *P. cryptocides*.[[7](#cit/section_3.7)]

## Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies

In 1978 and 1980, the [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (NCI) tested
[Cancell/Cantron/Protocel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446542&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and determined that the mixture lacked
substantial [antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

In 1990 and 1991, samples of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel were evaluated in NCI’s
*[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* [NCI-60 DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Screen](https://dtp.cancer.gov/discovery_development/nci-60/ "https://dtp.cancer.gov/discovery_development/nci-60/"). In the screen, the [cell lines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44016&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are grown in artificial media under conditions that do not truly mimic the *[in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* situation in animals or humans. The important information used in assessing a drug’s effectiveness in the NCI *in vitro* screen includes [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) concentrations necessary to achieve the following:

1. 50% inhibition of [cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) growth (GI50; the concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated [i.e., control] cells).
2. 100% (total) growth inhibition (TGI; the concentration required to completely halt the growth of treated cells).
3. 50% cell kill or lethal concentration (LC50; the concentration that kills 50% of treated cells).

The log10 values for GI50, TGI, and LC50 for the 60 cell lines are available [online](https://dtp.cancer.gov/databases_tools/docs/compare/compare_methodology.htm "https://dtp.cancer.gov/databases_tools/docs/compare/compare_methodology.htm").

The variations in log10 values for GI50 are 0.4 to 1.8 ([mean](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285973&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) = 1.15), equivalent to concentrations of 2.5 to 63 [μg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306521&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/[mL](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (mean = 14); the variations in log10 values for TGI are 1.0 to 2.5 (mean = 1.62), equivalent to 10 to 320 μg/mL (mean = 41); and the variations in log10 values for LC50 are 1.6 to 3.9 (mean = 3.17), equivalent to 39 to 7,943 μg/mL (mean = 1,479).

Cancell/Cantron/Protocel Tumor Cell Line Screen Results

| Parameter Measured | 60 Cell-line Range (μg/mL) | Mean (μg/mL) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 50% growth inhibition (GI50) | 2.5–63 | 14 |
| Total growth inhibition (TGI) | 10–320 | 41 |
| Concentration for 50% lethality (LC50) | 39–7,943 | 1,479 |
| Maximum theoretical human [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) concentration (for comparison) | — | 29 (calculated) |

Based on the manufacturer's recommended [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of a marketed brand of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel it has been calculated that under idealized conditions of absolutely no loss of the constituents after [administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to a patient (i.e., 100% [bioavailability](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44225&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), meaning no loss due to degradation, [absorption](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463702&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body, or rapid excretion—an unlikely situation), the maximum concentration that could be achieved in the plasma of an average 154-lb male is 29 μg/mL (antilog of 1.46). Thus, under these highly idealized conditions Cancell/Cantron/Protocel may exhibit some mild inhibitory effect on the growth of some cancer cells, but it would not be expected to inhibit their growth completely or to kill them. There is little evidence that any of the constituents of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel would be available in the bloodstream of a patient.

Activity was seen in two-thirds of the cell lines, though at levels that would be roughly 275 times higher than the theoretical maximum concentration achievable in [serum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44088&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Therefore, the *in vitro* effects are likely due to nonspecific effects of changes in salt concentration. Furthermore, cells in the NCI Tumor Cell Line Screen are grown in artificial media under conditions that do not truly mimic the *in vivo* situation in animals or humans, and results obtained with the screen may not accurately reflect possible effects in humans. To place the findings for Cancell/Cantron/Protocel in perspective, any conventional drug exhibiting this low level of *in vitro* activity in the NCI human cancer cell line screen would normally not be investigated further by NCI.

The principal manufacturers of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel have stated that they have
performed numerous animal experiments with the mixture involving tens of
thousands of mice.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)] Results of these
experiments, however, have not been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and
no information beyond stating that some of the experiments tested the toxicity
of Cancell/Cantron/Protocel has been provided.

## Summary of the Evidence for Cancell/Cantron/Protocel

To assist readers in evaluating the results of [human studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for cancer, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the [levels of
evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever
possible. To qualify for a level of evidence analysis, a study must:

- Be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.
- Report on a therapeutic outcome or outcomes, such as tumor [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), improvement in survival, or measured improvement in [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Describe clinical findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made.

No levels of evidence analysis could be performed for [Cancell/Cantron/Protocel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446542&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) because no study of its use in humans has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).
