### Incidence and Mortality

Estimated new cases and deaths from gallbladder (and other biliary) cancer in the United States in 2025:[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

- New cases: 12,610.
- Deaths: 4,400.

Cancer that arises in the gallbladder is uncommon.

### Clinical Features

The most common symptoms caused by gallbladder cancer are
jaundice, pain, and fever.

### Histopathology and Diagnostics

In patients whose
superficial cancer (T1 or confined to the mucosa) is discovered on pathological examination of tissue after
gallbladder removal for other reasons, the disease is often cured without
further therapy. In patients who present with symptoms, the tumor is
rarely diagnosed preoperatively.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] In such cases, the tumor often cannot be
removed completely by surgery and the disease cannot be cured, although palliative measures
may be beneficial. For patients with T2 or greater disease, extended resection with partial hepatectomy and portal lymph node dissection may be an option.[[3](#cit/section_1.3),[4](#cit/section_1.4)]

### Other Prognostic Factors

Cholelithiasis is an associated finding in most cases, but less than 1% of patients with cholelithiasis develop
this cancer.

**Localized and Locally Advanced**

Patients with stage I disease have cancer confined to the gallbladder wall that can be
completely resected. Patients with stage I tumors that are discovered incidentally and resected during routine cholecystectomy have 5-year survival rates of
nearly 100%.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

Patients with stage II or III disease have tumors with direct extension into the muscular layer, serosa, or adjacent organs, with or without involvement of locoregional lymph nodes.

**Unresectable**

Patients with disease that has spread beyond the locoregional lymph nodes or to distant organs have unresectable tumors, and standard therapy is directed at palliation. Patients with earlier-stage disease with poor performance status and/or significant comorbidities may be deemed poor surgical candidates.

## Treatment of Localized and Locally Advanced Gallbladder Cancer

### Treatment Options for Localized and Locally Advanced Gallbladder Cancer

Previously unsuspected gallbladder cancer that is incidentally discovered in the
mucosa of the gallbladder during pathological examination is curable in more than
80% of patients. However, symptomatic gallbladder cancer that is suspected prior to surgery often penetrates the muscularis and serosa. This type of gallbladder cancer is curable in less
than 5% of patients.

One study reported the patterns of lymph node spread from gallbladder
cancer and outcomes of patients with metastases to lymph nodes in 111
consecutive surgical patients in a single institution from 1981 to 1995.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The standard surgical procedure was removal of the
gallbladder, a wedge resection of the liver, resection of the extrahepatic bile
duct, and resection of the regional (N1 and N2) lymph nodes. Kaplan-Meier
estimates of the 5-year survival rates were 42.5% ± 6.5% for patients with node-negative tumors pathologically staged
as T2 to T4 and
31% ± 6.2% for patients with similar node-positive tumors.

Treatment options for localized and locally advanced gallbladder cancer include:

1. [Surgery](/types/gallbladder/hp/gallbladder-treatment-pdq#_221).
2. [External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT)](/types/gallbladder/hp/gallbladder-treatment-pdq#_227).
3. Clinical trials exploring the use of radiation therapy and radiosensitizer drugs to improve local control.

#### Surgery

In patients with previously unsuspected gallbladder cancer that is discovered in the
surgical specimen after a routine gallbladder operation and confined to
mucosa (T1), most disease is cured.[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[3](#cit/section_4.3)] During laparoscopic removal of an unsuspected cancer, implantation of carcinoma at all port sites (including the camera site) is possible.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] All port sites are typically excised completely, even for stage I cancers.

The need for reexploration for more extended resection in incidentally discovered T1b disease is controversial. A multicenter retrospective review identified lymph node metastases in 12% of patients who underwent re-resection after cholecystectomy, but there are no prospective data regarding relative outcome with a second surgery in these patients.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Patients with T2 or T3 disease have higher rates of unsuspected invasive disease at the time of diagnosis. A multicenter retrospective review was performed in patients who underwent re-resection after carcinoma was discovered incidentally. Residual disease was present in 57% of patients with T2 disease (including 31% with lymph node involvement and 10% with liver involvement) and in 77% of patients with T3 disease (including 46% with lymph node metastases and 36% with liver involvement).[[5](#cit/section_4.5)] On the basis of these observations, eligible patients may undergo reexploration to resect liver tissue near the gallbladder bed, portal lymph nodes, and lymphatic tissue in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Retrospective analyses suggest that extended re-resection can delay recurrences and potentially improve survival.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)-[8](#cit/section_4.8)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

For patients with locoregional lymph node involvement (at the cystic duct, common bile duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein), long-term disease-free survival can occasionally be achieved with radical resection. In patients with jaundice (stage III or stage IV), preoperative percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for relief of biliary obstruction should be considered.

Surgery with curative intent is not considered possible in patients with metastatic spread beyond the locoregional lymph nodes or to distant organs.

#### EBRT

The use of EBRT with or
without chemotherapy as a primary treatment has been reported to produce short-term disease control in small groups of patients. Similar benefits have been reported
for radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, administered after
resection.[[9](#cit/section_4.9),[10](#cit/section_4.10)]

There are no phase III studies to support the use of adjuvant radiation therapy, even for patients with high-risk localized disease.

### Current Clinical Trials

## Treatment of Unresectable, Metastatic, or Recurrent Gallbladder Cancer

### Treatment Options for Unresectable, Metastatic, or Recurrent Gallbladder Cancer

Unresectable, metastatic, and recurrent gallbladder cancers are not curable. Symptoms can be significantly improved with relief of biliary obstruction. A few patients have very
slow-growing tumors and may live several years.
Patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent gallbladder cancer should consider enrolling in clinical trials whenever possible. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Treatment options for unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent gallbladder cancer include:

1. [Percutaneous transhepatic drainage or endoscopically placed stents, or surgical bypass](/types/gallbladder/hp/gallbladder-treatment-pdq#_234).
2. [Systemic therapy](/types/gallbladder/hp/gallbladder-treatment-pdq#_237).

#### Percutaneous transhepatic drainage or endoscopically placed stents, or surgical bypass

Relief of biliary obstruction is warranted when symptoms such as pruritus and hepatic dysfunction outweigh other symptoms of the cancer. The preferred approach is percutaneous transhepatic drainage or endoscopically placed stents.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] Surgical bypass may be appropriate when these approaches are infeasible.

Palliative radiation therapy after biliary drainage may be beneficial. Patients may be candidates for inclusion in clinical trials that explore ways to improve the effects of radiation therapy with various radiosensitizers, such as hyperthermia, radiosensitizer drugs, or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

#### Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is appropriate for selected patients with adequate performance status and intact organ function. Fluoropyrimidines, gemcitabine, platinum agents, and docetaxel have produced transient partial remissions in a few patients. The incidence of gallbladder cancer is low, and clinical trials often enroll patients with all subsites of biliary tract cancers. Therefore, data must be interpreted with caution when applied specifically to patients with gallbladder cancer. In clinical practice, treatment algorithms in advanced disease often follow those with biliary tract cancer, relying on extrapolation from other trials. In this section, only current landmark studies, or those that specifically enrolled patients with gallbladder cancer, have been explicitly summarized. For more information, see [Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) Treatment](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq).

##### Capecitabine and fluorouracil dosing

The *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[3](#cit/section_5.3)] Patients with the *DPYD\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)-[4](#cit/section_5.4)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)-[7](#cit/section_5.7)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[8](#cit/section_5.8)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)]

1. In a phase III study, 410 patients with unresectable metastatic, or recurrent biliary tract cancer were randomly assigned to receive up to 6 months of gemcitabine with or without cisplatin.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)]

- With a median follow-up of 8.2 months, the median overall survival (OS) was superior for patients who received combination chemotherapy (11.7 months vs. 8.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.80; *P* < .001).[[10](#cit/section_5.10)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- A similar median OS benefit was demonstrated in all subgroups, including 149 patients with gallbladder cancer.
- Grade 3 and 4 toxicities occurred with similar frequency in both study arms, except for increased hematologic toxic effects in patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin and increased hepatotoxicity in patients who received single-agent gemcitabine.
2. An international, multicenter, phase III study ([TOPAZ-1](/clinicaltrials/NCT03875235) [NCT03875235]) included 685 patients with previously untreated and unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either durvalumab or placebo with cisplatin plus gemcitabine for up to eight cycles, followed by durvalumab or placebo maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After a median follow-up of 23.4 months for patients in the durvalumab group, the following was observed:[[11](#cit/section_5.11),[12](#cit/section_5.12)]

- The primary end point of median OS was 12.9 months in the durvalumab group and 11.3 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64–0.91). In the durvalumab group, the 18-month OS rate was 35.1%, and the 24-month OS was 24.9%. In the placebo group, the 18-month OS rate was 25.5%, and the 24-month OS rate was 10.4%.[[11](#cit/section_5.11),[12](#cit/section_5.12)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- There was no significant difference between groups in the number of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events or the number of events leading to discontinuation of a study medication.
3. An international, multicenter, phase III study ([KEYNOTE-966](/clinicaltrials/NCT04003636) [NCT04003636]) enrolled 1,069 patients with previously untreated unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 35 cycles. This was combined with gemcitabine (with no maximum duration) and cisplatin for up to 8 cycles. After a median follow-up of 25.6 months, the following results were observed:[[13](#cit/section_5.13)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The median OS was 12.7 months in the pembrolizumab group and 10.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95; one-sided *P* = .0034).
- There was no difference in the total frequency of treatment-related adverse events between treatment groups, including grade 3 or grade 4 events. Death due to treatment-related adverse events was seen in a total of eight patients (2%) in the pembrolizumab arm and three patients (1%) in the placebo arm.
4. A three-arm randomized phase III study of patients with unresectable gallbladder cancer compared best supportive care (n = 27), fluorouracil plus folinic acid (FUFA) weekly for 30 weeks (n = 28), and modified gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (mGEMOX) for up to six 21-day cycles.[[14](#cit/section_5.14)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- With a median follow-up of 9 months, the OS was 4.5 months for patients who received best supportive care (95% CI, 0.2−8.8), 4.6 months for patients who received FUFA (95% CI, 3−6.2), and 9.5 months for patients who received mGEMOX (95% CI, 5−14; *P* = .039).
- The only significant difference in grade 3 or 4 toxicities between the chemotherapy arms was transaminitis, which was more prevalent in the mGEMOX arm (*P* = .04).
5. A phase III noninferiority study ([NCT01470443](/clinicaltrials/NCT01470443)) enrolled 114 patients with metastatic biliary tract cancers, including 30 (26%) with primary gallbladder cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) or gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX).[[15](#cit/section_5.15)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- OS was not significantly different, at 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0−12.6) for patients in the GEMOX group and 10.6 months (95% CI, 7.3−15.5) for patients in the XELOX group (*P* = .131).
- The primary end point of 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 44.6% for the GEMOX group and 46.7% for the XELOX group (95% CI of difference in 6-month PFS rate, -12% to 16%, meeting criteria for noninferiority).
- A predefined subgroup analysis based on the primary site of disease was performed. The analysis did not reveal a difference in objective response rate between the two arms in patients with gallbladder cancer (*P* = .598).

Pending additional clinical trials, cisplatin plus gemcitabine is considered the reference standard chemotherapy backbone for patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent gallbladder cancer. Extrapolating from the results of the TOPAZ-1 and KEYNOTE-966 trials for biliary tract cancer, addition of a checkpoint inhibitor (durvalumab or pembrolizumab) to first-line therapy has become the standard of care. Potential alternative regimens include gemcitabine plus capecitabine, GEMOX, and XELOX. All patients should consider clinical trials.

All patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent disease who have not already received checkpoint inhibitors should undergo molecular testing for deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Extrapolating from a subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatobiliary tumors in the [I-PREDICT](/clinicaltrials/NCT02534675) (NCT02534675) and [KEYNOTE-158](/clinicaltrials/NCT02628067) (NCT02628067) studies, patients with either dMMR or MSI-H tumors can be considered for treatment with pembrolizumab.[[16](#cit/section_5.16),[17](#cit/section_5.17)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Additional testing for *IDH1* variants, *FGFR2* gene fusions, and HER2 expression may provide potential targets in clinical trials. In clinical practice, targeted treatments that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as second-line treatments for patients with cholangiocarcinoma could likely be used to treat appropriate patients with gallbladder cancer. Compelling treatment options for these patients are scarce. For more information, see the [Targeted therapy](/types/liver/hp/bile-duct-treatment-pdq#_564) section in Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) Treatment.
