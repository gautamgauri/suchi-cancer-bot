## Salivary Gland Tumors

### Incidence

Salivary gland tumors are rare and account for 0.5% of all malignancies in children and adolescents. After rhabdomyosarcoma, they are the most common tumor in the head and neck.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[2](#cit/section_1.2)] Salivary gland tumors may occur after radiation therapy and chemotherapy are
given for the treatment of primary leukemia or solid tumors.[[3](#cit/section_1.3),[4](#cit/section_1.4)]

### Clinical Presentation

Most salivary gland neoplasms arise in the parotid gland.[[5](#cit/section_1.5)-[10](#cit/section_1.10)] About 15% of
these tumors arise in the submandibular glands or in the minor salivary
glands under the tongue and jaw.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)] These tumors are most frequently benign but
may be malignant, especially in young children.[[11](#cit/section_1.11)] In a systematic review of pediatric salivary gland tumors, the median age of patients was 13.3 years, and most tumors occurred in the second decade of life. There is a slight female predominance.[[12](#cit/section_1.12)]

### Histology and Molecular Features

The most common malignant salivary gland tumor in children
is mucoepidermoid carcinoma, followed by acinic cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Less common malignancies include rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma.[[1](#cit/section_1.1),[8](#cit/section_1.8),[10](#cit/section_1.10),[13](#cit/section_1.13)-[15](#cit/section_1.15)] Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is usually low or intermediate grade, although high-grade tumors do occur. Recurrent *CRTC1*::*MAML2* fusion genes have been detected in pediatric mucoepidermoid carcinomas, reflecting the common chromosome translocation t(11;19)(q21;p13) that is also seen in adults with salivary gland tumors.[[16](#cit/section_1.16)] In one study, 12 of 12 tumors were positive for *CRTC1*::*MAML2* fusion transcripts.[[17](#cit/section_1.17)]

Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) of the salivary gland, also called salivary gland secretory carcinoma,[[18](#cit/section_1.18)] is a newly described pathological entity that has been seen in children.[[19](#cit/section_1.19)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] In one review, it was estimated that 12% of MASC cases occurred in the pediatric population.[[20](#cit/section_1.20),[21](#cit/section_1.21)] MASC (salivary gland secretory carcinoma) is characterized by an *ETV6*::*NTRK3* fusion gene.[[22](#cit/section_1.22)]

Metachronous mucoepidermoid carcinomas may occur in association with childhood leukemias and lymphomas.[[23](#cit/section_1.23)] One retrospective study compared 12 pediatric patients with metachronous mucoepidermoid carcinomas secondary to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 6 pediatric and young adult patients with primary mucoepidermoid carcinomas. *KMT2A* rearrangements were detected in pediatric metachronous mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and *KMT2A* rearrangements were detected in the leukemia that preceded the mucoepidermoid carcinoma in 7 of the 12 patients. The prognosis of patients with concomitant metachronous mucoepidermoid carcinomas and ALL was worse than the prognosis of patients with primary mucoepidermoid carcinomas.

### Prognosis

The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for pediatric patients with salivary gland tumors is approximately 95%.[[24](#cit/section_1.24)] A review of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database identified 284 patients younger than 20 years with tumors of the parotid gland.[[25](#cit/section_1.25)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The OS rate was 96% at 5 years, 95% at 10 years, and 83% at 20 years. Adolescents had higher mortality rates (7.1%) than children younger than 15 years (1.6%; *P* = .23).

In an international systematic review of primary pediatric salivary gland tumors, there were 2,215 patients with malignant tumors between the ages of 0.3 and 19 years (mean age, 13.3 years). The 5-year OS rate was 93.1%, and the local recurrence rate was 18.1% in patients with malignant neoplasms.[[12](#cit/section_1.12)]

A retrospective multi-institutional survey identified 103 patients younger than 18 years with parotid gland cancer. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma was the most common histology (71 patients).[[26](#cit/section_1.26)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] The authors did not report if patients underwent previous therapies. However, they mentioned that 12 of 103 patients had a history of lymphoma. The 10-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate for the entire group was 91%. Presence of intraparotid lymph node metastasis (LNM) was associated with significantly worse event-free survival and OS, as was history of previous therapy for lymphoma. The 10-year RFS rate was 91% for patients without intraparotid LNM and 37% for patients with intraparotid LNM.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common type of treatment-related salivary gland tumor. With standard therapy, the 5-year survival rate is about 95% for patients with this tumor.[[15](#cit/section_1.15),[27](#cit/section_1.27),[28](#cit/section_1.28)]

A retrospective review identified 57 pediatric patients (aged <18 years) (4.6%) and 1,192 adult patients (95.4%) with acinic cell carcinoma.[[29](#cit/section_1.29)] Clinical LNMs were rare in children (n < 10) and adults (n = 88; 7.4%). Occult LNMs were uncommon in pediatric patients (n < 5) and adult patients (n = 41; 4.6%). The 3-year OS rate was 97.8% for pediatric patients. Adult patients with LNMs had worse 3-year OS rates than those without LNMs (66.0% vs. 96.3%; *P* < .001).

A retrospective study used the National Cancer Database to identify 72 patients between the ages of 0 and 21 years with adenoid cystic carcinoma of parotid and submandibular glands. The median age was 18 years, and 72.2% of patients were between the ages of 16 and 21 years. All patients had primary surgery. Most of the patients underwent lymph node dissection, and 70.8% of patients received radiation therapy. The 5-year OS rate was 93.2%, and the 10-year OS rate was 85.0%.[[30](#cit/section_1.30)]

### Treatment of Childhood Salivary Gland Tumors

The European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors within the PARTNER project (Paediatric Rare Tumours Network - European Registry) has published consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood salivary gland tumors.[[31](#cit/section_1.31)]

Treatment options for childhood salivary gland tumors include the following:

1. [Surgery](/types/head-and-neck/hp/child/salivary-gland-treatment-pdq#_1975).
2. [Radiation therapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/child/salivary-gland-treatment-pdq#_1976).
3. [Targeted therapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/child/salivary-gland-treatment-pdq#_1977).

#### Surgery

Radical surgical
removal is the treatment of choice for salivary gland tumors whenever possible, with additional use of
radiation therapy for high-grade tumors or tumors that have
invasive characteristics such as LNM, positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, or perineural extension.[[24](#cit/section_1.24),[32](#cit/section_1.32),[33](#cit/section_1.33)]; [[9](#cit/section_1.9)][[Level of evidence C1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810035&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Parotid gland tumors are removed with the aid of neurological monitoring to prevent damage to the facial nerve.

#### Radiation therapy

In an international systematic review of 2,215 pediatric patients with malignant salivary tumors, 28.9% received surgery and radiation therapy, 1.8% received surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, and 0.2% received radiation therapy alone.[[12](#cit/section_1.12)] One retrospective study compared proton therapy with conventional radiation therapy and found that proton therapy had a favorable acute toxicity and dosimetric profile.[[34](#cit/section_1.34)] Another retrospective study used brachytherapy with iodine I 125 seeds to treat 24 children with mucoepidermoid carcinoma who had high-risk factors. Seeds were implanted within 4 weeks of surgical resection. With a median follow-up of 7.2 years, the disease-free survival and OS rates were 100%. No severe radiation-associated complications were reported.[[35](#cit/section_1.35)][[Level of evidence C2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810037&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

#### Targeted therapy

Objective responses have been observed in all reported patients with recurrent *NTRK* fusion–positive MASC who were treated with entrectinib or larotrectinib.[[36](#cit/section_1.36),[37](#cit/section_1.37)] Ten of 11 adolescent or adult patients with *TRK* fusion–positive salivary gland tumors who were treated with larotrectinib experienced partial or complete responses.[[37](#cit/section_1.37)]

## Sialoblastoma

Sialoblastoma is usually a benign tumor presenting in the neonatal period, but it has been reported to present as late as age 15 years. Sialoblastoma rarely metastasizes to the lungs, lymph nodes, or bones.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

The main treatment for patients with sialoblastoma is surgical resection. However, it has been suggested that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be indicated as an alternative to mutilating surgery. Chemotherapy regimens with carboplatin, epirubicin, vincristine, etoposide, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide have produced responses in two children with sialoblastoma.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)]; [[3](#cit/section_2.3)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Ophthalmologists.
- Rehabilitation
specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families. Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)-[5](#cit/section_3.5)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)] The U.S. [Rare Diseases Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf "https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf") defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.

The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[[7](#cit/section_3.7),[8](#cit/section_3.8)] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:

- A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)]
- The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[[10](#cit/section_3.10)] These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)]

Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as [Salivary Gland Cancer Treatment](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/salivary-gland-treatment-pdq).
