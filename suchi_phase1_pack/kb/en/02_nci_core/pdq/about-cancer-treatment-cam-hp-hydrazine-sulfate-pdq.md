## Overview

[Go to Patient Version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/hydrazine-sulfate-pdq)

**NOTE: There is either no new research on this topic or the recent published research is weak and not appropriate for inclusion in the summary. Therefore, the information in this summary is no longer being updated and is provided for reference purposes only.**

This [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information summary provides
an overview of the use of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for people with cancer. The
summary includes a brief history of hydrazine sulfate research, results of
[clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and possible
[side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of hydrazine sulfate use.

This summary contains the following key information:

- Hydrazine sulfate is a chemical that has been studied as a treatment for cancer
and as a treatment for the body wasting (i.e.,
[cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) associated with this disease.
- It has been claimed that hydrazine sulfate limits the ability of tumors
to obtain [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is a type of sugar used by cells to create
energy.
- Hydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the incidence of [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
[liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in laboratory animals, suggesting it causes
cancer.
- There is only limited evidence from [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that hydrazine
sulfate has anticancer activity.
- Hydrazine sulfate has shown no anticancer activity in
[randomized clinical
trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and data concerning its effectiveness in treating cancer-related
cachexia are inconclusive.
- Hydrazine sulfate has been marketed in the United States as a [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or a [nutraceutical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269057&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by some companies; however,
its use as an anticancer drug outside of clinical trials has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.

## General Information

Hydrazine sulfate has been investigated as an anticancer treatment for more
than 30 years. It has been studied in combination with established treatments as a [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) agent. It has also been studied as a treatment for cancer-related [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (loss of appetite) and [cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(loss of muscle mass and body weight). Similar to other hydrazine compounds,
it has a core chemical structure that consists of two nitrogen atoms and four hydrogen atoms.

Hydrazine sulfate is marketed in the United States as a [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/[nutraceutical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269057&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by some companies. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. Therefore, premarket evaluation and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not required unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made. The FDA can, however, remove from the market dietary supplements that it deems unsafe. The use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer treatment outside of [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has not been approved by the FDA. The FDA has not approved the use of hydrazine sulfate for any medical condition.

To conduct clinical drug research in the United States, researchers must
file an [Investigational](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44763&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. The
FDA has granted IND status to at least three groups of researchers to study
hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)-[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

In [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), hydrazine sulfate has been added to the drinking water
or the food supply, or it has been given by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In clinical trials
involving cancer patients, hydrazine sulfate has been administered in pills or
capsules.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] In the [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) conducted thus far,
the [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the duration of hydrazine sulfate administration have varied.

## History

During the past 90 years, hydrazine compounds have been studied in animal
[cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) grown in the laboratory, in live animals, and in humans.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]
More than 400 hydrazine [analogs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44919&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (related
compounds) have been screened for their ability to kill [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In 1996, a
[retrospective](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44120&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) review of scientific
studies in which the anticancer activity of hydrazine analogs was investigated
found that 65 of 82 evaluated compounds showed some anticancer activity in [xenograft](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44095&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) models (tumor cells of one
species transplanted to another species).[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Of the 82
tested compounds, seven showed activity against human tumor cells and were,
therefore, selected for further testing in [pilot studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45838&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [phase I clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Among these seven compounds, only [procarbazine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=635746&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a methylhydrazine [derivative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), also called ibenzmethyzin or
natulan) completed preliminary testing in humans. Procarbazine exhibited
anticancer activity in patients with [Hodgkin disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45012&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45963&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and it was ultimately used in
several [first-line treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346494&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [regimens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the 1960s.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[3](#cit/section_3.3)] In
view of the initial success with procarbazine, hydrazine sulfate, which is
similar in chemical composition, was investigated for anticancer activity
beginning in the 1970s. During this period, investigation of hydrazine
sulfate as a treatment for cancer-related [cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was also initiated.
Research on hydrazine sulfate both as a single agent and in combination with
standard [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) regimens continued through the
mid-1990s.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)-[9](#cit/section_3.9)]

Although it was proposed in the early 1900s that hydrazine compounds are
[toxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to animals and to humans, they have been administered as [antidepressant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (e.g., iproniazid),
chemotherapy (e.g., procarbazine), and [antituberculosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44106&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (e.g., isoniazid)
drugs. In addition to medicinal uses, hydrazine compounds have been used in
industry and agriculture as components of rocket fuel, as [herbicides](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44112&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and as [antioxidants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in boiler and
cooling-tower water.[[10](#cit/section_3.10)-[12](#cit/section_3.12)] Many scientists consider hydrazine sulfate
and other hydrazine analogs to be cancer-causing agents, and they have
expressed concern about the safety of these compounds.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[10](#cit/section_3.10),[12](#cit/section_3.12)-[21](#cit/section_3.21)] In the 10th Report on Carcinogens, hydrazine and hydrazine sulfate are listed
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Toxicology
Program as “reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens.”[[22](#cit/section_3.22)] When the
antituberculosis drug isoniazid and hydrazine antidepressants are combined
with purified [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44393&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in the laboratory, they produce [hydrogen peroxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44113&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [free radicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44030&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that can damage the
DNA.[[14](#cit/section_3.14),[17](#cit/section_3.17),[23](#cit/section_3.23)] Hydrazine compounds have been reported to cause
[mutations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and [chromosome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) damage in [bacteria](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44123&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and in plant and animal
cells.[[10](#cit/section_3.10)]

Two mechanisms of action have been proposed for hydrazine sulfate to
explain its potential antitumor and [anticachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44104&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) properties. Both
mechanisms involve the utilization of [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (sugar), which tumors require as
a main source of energy for growth. In one proposed mechanism, hydrazine
sulfate blocks [gluconeogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44111&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
through inhibition of the [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.[[24](#cit/section_3.24)-[29](#cit/section_3.29)] Gluconeogenesis is
a process by which extra glucose (in addition to that obtained from the diet)
can be formed in the liver and the kidneys from the breakdown products of
sugars, [lipids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (fats), and [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It has been suggested that
cachexia occurs because the body must use increasing amounts of energy and
other resources, including its own protein, to meet the demand for glucose by
tumors.[[24](#cit/section_3.24)-[30](#cit/section_3.30)] Blocking gluconeogenesis and interfering with
the supply of [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to tumors has been proposed as one way to inhibit
tumor growth and to prevent cachexia.

In the second proposed mechanism, hydrazine sulfate inhibits [tumor necrosis factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TNF)-alpha activity.[[31](#cit/section_3.31)-[34](#cit/section_3.34)] TNF-alpha, which is also known as cachectin, is
one of a number of substances normally produced by [white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the
body in response to [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by [microorganisms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44059&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and in response to
other stimuli such as tissue damage.[[31](#cit/section_3.31),[32](#cit/section_3.32),[34](#cit/section_3.34)-[36](#cit/section_3.36)] Higher-than-normal TNF-alpha production has been observed in white blood cells obtained
from cancer patients. It has been suggested that higher-than-normal levels of TNF-alpha can cause the [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), increased energy
expenditure, and increased muscle protein breakdown seen in cancer
patients.[[31](#cit/section_3.31),[35](#cit/section_3.35)-[37](#cit/section_3.37)] Some of the muscle protein breakdown products
would become available for gluconeogenesis. Inhibition of TNF-alpha activity
might, therefore, inhibit tumor growth and prevent cachexia.

## Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies

Hydrazine compounds have been studied both as potential anticancer drugs
and as cancer-causing agents. Early studies of hydrazines, including
hydrazine sulfate, were conducted to determine whether these compounds could
cause cancer in healthy laboratory animals.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[11](#cit/section_4.11)]
Substantial increases in [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) incidence were observed in most studies that
used rats, mice, or hamsters.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[5](#cit/section_4.5),[7](#cit/section_4.7)-[9](#cit/section_4.9)] Hydrazine administration was
associated with increases in [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumors in rats,[[2](#cit/section_4.2),[5](#cit/section_4.5)]
increases in lung and liver tumors in mice,[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[4](#cit/section_4.4),[8](#cit/section_4.8)] and increases in liver
tumors in hamsters.[[7](#cit/section_4.7),[9](#cit/section_4.9)] In one study, hydrazine sulfate increased the
incidence of lung tumors in both males and females of the mouse strain C3H,
but reduced the incidence of breast [adenocarcinomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46216&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in C3H
females.[[3](#cit/section_4.3)]

[Animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer have
investigated this compound as a single agent and in combination with
established [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) drugs.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)-[18](#cit/section_4.18)] In studies conducted in one
laboratory, hydrazine sulfate alone was found to cause [dose-dependent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44110&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) inhibition of tumor
growth in rats bearing Walker 256 [carcinosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44003&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or Murphy-Sturm [lymphosarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44115&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumors and in mice
bearing B-16 [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tumors.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)-[14](#cit/section_4.14)] Hydrazine sulfate alone had no effect
on [solid tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45301&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) formed from L-1210 [leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45343&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in mice.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)] In work
performed in another laboratory, hydrazine sulfate alone inhibited the growth
of FBCa [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer tumors in one of two experiments in rats, but it had no
effect on the growth of 13762NF [mammary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44560&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) adenocarcinomas in rats.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)] Findings
from a third laboratory demonstrated that hydrazine sulfate alone had no
effect on the growth of Dunning [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer tumors in rats.[[18](#cit/section_4.18)]

It is important to note that the best tumor responses to hydrazine sulfate
as a single agent (i.e., tumor reductions of approximately 50% or more) were
accompanied by substantial losses in animal body weight.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)-[14](#cit/section_4.14)] This
finding appears to be inconsistent with the proposed use of hydrazine sulfate
as an [anticachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44104&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) agent.

In other experiments, hydrazine sulfate was combined with individual
chemotherapy drugs ([cyclophosphamide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45253&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [mitomycin C](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=713798&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [methotrexate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45393&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bleomycin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=637625&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fluorouracil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46090&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [5-FU],
[carmustine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45976&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [BCNU], or
neocarzinostatin) to treat Walker 256 carcinosarcoma tumors in rats and solid
L-1210 leukemia tumors in mice.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)-[15](#cit/section_4.15)] For both tumor types, enhanced
anticancer effects were observed. In the experiments with L-1210 tumors,
cyclophosphamide and mitomycin C were more effective when combined with
hydrazine sulfate than they were when used alone.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)] As indicated
previously, hydrazine sulfate alone had no effect against solid L-1210
tumors.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)]

Addition of the drug clofibrate to the hydrazine sulfate plus chemotherapy
drug combinations was reported to produce even greater antitumor effects.[[15](#cit/section_4.15)]
Clofibrate lowers blood [lipid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels and has the potential to inhibit
[gluconeogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44111&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by limiting the availability of lipid breakdown products for
the synthesis of [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This three drug treatment [regimen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
however, was tested against only one type of tumor (Walker 256
carcinosarcomas in rats).[[15](#cit/section_4.15)]

Hydrazine sulfate has also been tested in combination with drugs that
affect the uptake of glucose by [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The combination of hydrazine sulfate
and phloretin, a drug that blocks glucose uptake, showed greater activity
against FBCa bladder cancer tumors in rats than was found with hydrazine
sulfate alone; however, this combination did not exhibit enhanced antitumor
activity against 13762NF mammary adenocarcinomas in rats.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)] When hydrazine
sulfate was combined with the drug phloridzin, which is similar to phloretin,
using the same two [tumor models](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44091&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), no
increase in anticancer activity was observed.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)] When hydrazine sulfate was
combined with the drug phenformin, which increases glucose uptake by cells
(and lowers blood glucose levels), enhanced antitumor activity against Walker
256 carcinosarcomas in rats was observed.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)]

In the 1980s, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducted [preclinical
studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of hydrazine sulfate as a single agent, using many of the animal
tumor models described above. With the exception of borderline activity
against Walker 256 carcinosarcomas in rats, no evidence of antitumor activity
was found.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)] In view of these results, NCI recommended against
further evaluation of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer agent.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)] However, [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) investigation of this compound continued, largely
because of its potential as a treatment for cancer-related [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and
[cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Human/Clinical Studies

Most of the information presented here is summarized in a
table located at the end of this section.

Hydrazine sulfate has been studied extensively in patients with advanced
cancer. These studies have evaluated the following: a) [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or
survival among patients with various types of cancer,[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[13](#cit/section_5.13)] b)
changes in body weight,[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[6](#cit/section_5.6),[8](#cit/section_5.8),[10](#cit/section_5.10)-[12](#cit/section_5.12),[14](#cit/section_5.14)] c) carefully measured
[quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[6](#cit/section_5.6),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] and d)
changes in nutritional or [metabolic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44056&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
status.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[12](#cit/section_5.12),[13](#cit/section_5.13),[16](#cit/section_5.16),[17](#cit/section_5.17)] [Clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of hydrazine sulfate have been
funded by a pharmaceutical company,[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] the Russian government,[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10),[18](#cit/section_5.18)]
and by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI).[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[6](#cit/section_5.6),[8](#cit/section_5.8),[11](#cit/section_5.11),[12](#cit/section_5.12),[15](#cit/section_5.15),[16](#cit/section_5.16)] They have also been
sponsored by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) [[5](#cit/section_5.5),[6](#cit/section_5.6)] and the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).[[4](#cit/section_5.4),[15](#cit/section_5.15)]

The first clinical tests of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer
were conducted in the mid-1970s by a pharmaceutical company.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] In an [uncontrolled study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of 158
patients with advanced disease, it was found that 45 of 84 [evaluable patients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44029&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) had
[subjective improvements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330183&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., the patients reported an increase in appetite,
a decrease in weight loss, an increase in strength, or a decrease in pain) and
that 14 had [objective improvements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335101&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e., there was measurable tumor [regression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [stable disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45884&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or improvement in a
cancer-related disorder) in response to treatment with hydrazine sulfate.
Among the patients with objective responses, two had long-term (17 and 18
months) stabilization of their disease and seven had measurable tumor
regression, although the extent and duration of these regressions were not
specified. Major weaknesses of this study included the absence of a [control](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(i.e., comparison) group and the fact that 74 of the 158 initially recruited
patients could not be evaluated because of poor [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), missing documentation,
insufficient duration of treatment, and/or [concurrent therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44011&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e.,
therapy given at the same time) with other anticancer drugs.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)]

In 1976, Russian [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported findings from 95 patients with
advanced cancer who had been treated with hydrazine sulfate after all previous
therapy ([surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and/or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) had
failed.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)] Three [partial responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45819&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (i.e.,
reductions in tumor size of greater than 50% observed for a period of 4 weeks
or more) and no [complete responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were noted
after 1 to 5 months of treatment. Tumor regressions of 50% or less and stable
disease (i.e., cessation of tumor growth for a period of 1.5 to 2.0 months or
more) were reported for 16 and 20 patients, respectively.

In 1981, the same investigators published findings from 225 patients with
advanced disease who had been treated with hydrazine sulfate after all
previous therapy had failed.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] It appears that the 225 patients described in
this second report [[10](#cit/section_5.10)] included the 95 patients described in the first
report.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)] Partial responses and stable disease were reported for 4 and
95 patients, respectively, after 1 to 6 months of treatment. No patient
experienced a complete response. Subjective improvements in appetite, weight
stabilization or gain, pain, fever, breathing, and/or mental outlook were
reported by 147 patients.

In 1995, the same Russian investigators published findings from 740
patients with advanced cancer.[[7](#cit/section_5.7)] Once again, it appears that 225 of these
740 patients were described in the earlier reports.[[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10)] Partial responses
and stable disease were reported for 25 and 263 patients, respectively.
Complete responses were noted for six patients. Subjective improvements in
cancer-related [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were reported by
344 patients.

In 1994, the same investigators reported findings from a [clinical series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44010&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) involving 46
patients with [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) brain tumors
(38 with [glioblastomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45698&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), four with
[astrocytomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45602&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and four with [meningiomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45783&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and six patients with [benign](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45614&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) brain tumors.[[18](#cit/section_5.18)] These patients
were not described in the other reports.[[7](#cit/section_5.7),[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10)] All patients in this
series appear to have been treated with surgery in addition to hydrazine
sulfate therapy, and at least some of the patients were also treated with
radiation therapy. Complete or partial regression of [neurologic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44117&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) symptoms (e.g., [seizures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45484&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),
headaches, [sensory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44121&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [motor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44116&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disorders, and hallucinations) was
reported for 73% of the patients. In addition, longer-than-average survival
was reported for most patients. Among the patients with glioblastomas, the
increase in average survival time was from 6 months to more than 13
months.[[18](#cit/section_5.18)]

Evaluation of the findings from these Russian clinical series [[7](#cit/section_5.7),[9](#cit/section_5.9),[10](#cit/section_5.10),[18](#cit/section_5.18)]
is made difficult by the limited information provided about the patients and
their treatment histories. In addition, insufficient information was given
about study design and methodology. The absence of control groups; the
receipt of prior or concurrent surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy
by all patients; and the reliance on subjective measures of quality of life
are major study weaknesses. Therefore, it is difficult to ascribe any of the
positive findings to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. In contrast with the
previously described clinical series, three NCI-funded clinical series found
no complete responses or partial responses among a total of 79 patients
treated with hydrazine sulfate.[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[8](#cit/section_5.8),[11](#cit/section_5.11)] In addition, only temporary, minor
improvements in appetite, pain, and weight stabilization or gain were reported
by the patients in these series. A weakness in these three clinical series was
the absence of control groups.

Findings from four [placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [randomized clinical
trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), however, also fail to support the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate
as a cancer treatment in humans.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[6](#cit/section_5.6),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] In these trials,
survival,[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[6](#cit/section_5.6),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] objective tumor response,[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[4](#cit/section_5.4),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] and carefully measured
quality of life [[4](#cit/section_5.4)-[6](#cit/section_5.6),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] were major [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

One of the trials involved 65 patients with advanced [non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and examined the effects of hydrazine sulfate
on survival and nutritional status.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] In this trial, patients received
either hydrazine sulfate or [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in addition to a multiple-drug
chemotherapy [regimen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). When all patients were evaluated, no improvement in
survival was found with hydrazine sulfate therapy. In addition, no
differences were noted in objective tumor response between the hydrazine
sulfate group and the placebo group. However, on the basis of [caloric intake](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the maintenance
of [serum albumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44122&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels, the
nutritional status of the patients in the hydrazine sulfate group was judged
better than that of the patients in the placebo group. However, the moderate
increases in body weight associated with hydrazine sulfate use did not achieve
[statistical significance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44167&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

A CALGB-sponsored trial also evaluated the use of hydrazine sulfate as a
treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.[[4](#cit/section_5.4),[15](#cit/section_5.15)] In
this trial, 266 patients received either hydrazine sulfate or placebo in
addition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen. No differences in survival,
objective tumor response, [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), weight gain or loss, or nutritional status
were observed between the hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group.
However, the quality of life of the patients who received hydrazine sulfate
was found to be statistically significantly worse than that of the patients
who received placebo.

The use of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for patients with non-small
cell lung cancer was also evaluated in an NCCTG-sponsored trial.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] In this
trial, 243 patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrazine sulfate
or placebo in addition to a multiple-drug chemotherapy regimen. No
statistically significant differences were found between the hydrazine sulfate
group and the placebo group with respect to either survival or
quality of life.

Another NCCTG-sponsored trial tested hydrazine sulfate alone versus
placebo in the treatment of 127 patients with [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [colorectal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] In this trial,
the patients who received hydrazine sulfate had, on average, shorter survival
than the patients who received placebo, a finding that was statistically
significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the
hydrazine sulfate group and the placebo group with respect to weight gain or
loss, anorexia, or quality of life.

Four other clinical trials did find some objective evidence of benefit with
hydrazine sulfate therapy.[[12](#cit/section_5.12),[13](#cit/section_5.13),[16](#cit/section_5.16),[17](#cit/section_5.17)] These trials had either nutritional
status or [metabolic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44056&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) status as the primary endpoint. In a placebo-controlled,
randomized trial involving 38 patients with advanced disease, hydrazine
sulfate was found to improve the abnormal [glucose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44033&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) metabolism seen in cancer patients.[[13](#cit/section_5.13)]
In another placebo-controlled, randomized trial that involved 101 patients
with advanced cancer and weight loss, the use of hydrazine sulfate was
associated with statistically significant improvements in appetite and either
weight increase or weight maintenance.[[12](#cit/section_5.12)] However, the higher average
caloric intake observed in this study for patients treated with hydrazine
sulfate compared with patients treated with placebo was not statistically
significant.[[12](#cit/section_5.12)] Two other clinical studies involving a total of 34 patients
with either [lung](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer or [colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer found that hydrazine sulfate was able
to reduce the body [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) breakdown associated with cancer [cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[16](#cit/section_5.16),[17](#cit/section_5.17)]
In view of the totality of evidence, the overall importance of the findings
from these four clinical trials is not clear.

A search of the PDQ clinical trials database indicates that no
clinical trials of hydrazine sulfate as a therapy for cancer are being
conducted at this time.

## Adverse Effects

The [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) associated with [hydrazine sulfate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44283&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) use have been mainly [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and
[neurologic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44117&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[12](#cit/section_6.12)] [Nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or [vomiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), dizziness, and sensory
and motor [neuropathies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46041&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been
reported.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[12](#cit/section_6.12)] The sensory and motor neuropathies have included
[paresthesias](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44118&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (abnormal touch
sensations, such as burning or prickling, in the absence of external stimuli)
of the upper and lower extremities (i.e., the arms and the legs, including the
hands and the feet), [polyneuritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44119&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
(simultaneous [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of
several peripheral nerves), and impaired fine motor function (e.g., an
impaired ability to write).[[2](#cit/section_6.2),[5](#cit/section_6.5),[7](#cit/section_6.7)-[9](#cit/section_6.9)] Other side effects have included dry
skin and/or itching, [insomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44043&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [hypoglycemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44114&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_6.1),[2](#cit/section_6.2),[7](#cit/section_6.7),[9](#cit/section_6.9)] One case of
fatal [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [kidney failure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and one case of severe [encephalopathy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44137&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (an injury to the
brain) have been associated with the use of hydrazine sulfate.[[13](#cit/section_6.13),[14](#cit/section_6.14)] The former case involved a man aged 55 years with [squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the maxillary sinus who purchased hydrazine sulfate from a source found on the Internet and proceeded to take it without medical advice or supervision. After 4 months he presented with evidence of renal and liver [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445093&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which eventually resulted in death. This case highlights the danger of accessing materials and medical information on the Internet and proceeding with self-[medication](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463717&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without seeking proper medical advice and supervision.[[15](#cit/section_6.15)]

The side effects of hydrazine sulfate have been described as
mild to moderate in severity, and their incidence appears to have been low.
Most side effects are reported to resolve when treatment is stopped. However,
limited evidence from [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) suggests that hydrazine sulfate is
highly [toxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when combined with either alcohol or [barbiturates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44107&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[16](#cit/section_6.16)-[19](#cit/section_6.19)]

## Summary of the Evidence for Hydrazine Sulfate

Several clinical [case series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44006&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) conducted by Russian [investigators](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have indicated that hydrazine sulfate has marginal anticancer activity, but these results are considered inconclusive due to the lack of [control groups](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and insufficient information provided about study methodology. Well-controlled [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) conducted in the United States have shown no evidence of anticancer activity. In addition, evidence concerning the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment
for cancer-related [cachexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is inconclusive. Furthermore,
hydrazine sulfate has been shown to increase the incidence of several types of
tumors in animals, and it has been classified as a potential [carcinogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46486&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by the
National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. The use of hydrazine sulfate as an anticancer drug outside the context of clinical trials
has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, thus, cannot be recommended.

Separate [levels of evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and [scientific](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For additional information about levels of evidence analysis, refer to [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).

The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us"). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
