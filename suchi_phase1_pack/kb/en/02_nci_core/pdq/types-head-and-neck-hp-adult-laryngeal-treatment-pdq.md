### Incidence and Mortality

Estimated new cases and deaths from laryngeal cancer in the United States in 2025:[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

- New cases: 13,020.
- Deaths: 3,910.

### Anatomy

The larynx is divided into the following three anatomical regions:

- The supraglottic larynx
includes the epiglottis, false vocal cords, ventricles, aryepiglottic folds,
and arytenoids.
- The glottis includes the true vocal cords and the anterior and
posterior commissures.
- The subglottic region begins about 1 cm below
the true vocal cords and extends to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage
or the first tracheal ring.

The supraglottic area is rich in lymphatic drainage. After penetrating the
pre-epiglottic space and thyrohyoid membrane, lymphatic drainage is initially
to the jugulodigastric and midjugular nodes. About 25% to 50% of patients
present with involved lymph nodes. The precise figure depends on the T (tumor) stage. The
true vocal cords are devoid of lymphatics. As a result, vocal cord cancer
confined to the true cords rarely, if ever, presents with involved lymph nodes.
Extension above or below the cords may, however, lead to lymph node
involvement. Primary subglottic cancers, which are quite rare, drain through
the cricothyroid and cricotracheal membranes to the pretracheal, paratracheal,
and inferior jugular nodes, and occasionally to mediastinal nodes.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

### Risk Factors

There is a clear association among smoking, excess alcohol ingestion,
and the development of squamous cell cancers of the upper aerodigestive
tract.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] For smokers, the risk of laryngeal cancer decreases after they stop smoking but remains elevated, even years later, compared with that of nonsmokers.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)] If a patient who has had a single cancer continues to smoke and drink
alcoholic beverages, the likelihood of a cure for the initial cancer, by any
modality, is diminished, and the risk of second tumor is enhanced. Because of clinical problems related to smoking and alcohol use in this
population, many patients die of intercurrent illness rather than the
primary cancer.

### Clinical Features

Supraglottic cancers typically present with sore throat, painful swallowing,
referred ear pain, change in voice quality, or enlarged neck nodes. Early
vocal cord cancers are usually detected because of hoarseness. By the time
they are detected, cancers arising in the subglottic area commonly involve the
vocal cords; thus, symptoms usually relate to contiguous spread.

### Prognostic Factors

The most important adverse prognostic factors for laryngeal cancers include
increasing T stage and N (regional lymph node) stage. Other prognostic factors may include sex, age,
performance status, and a variety of pathological features of the tumor,
including grade and depth of invasion.[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

Prognosis for small laryngeal cancers that have not spread to lymph nodes is
very good. Cure rates are 75% to 95% depending on the site, tumor bulk,[[6](#cit/section_1.6)]
and degree of infiltration. Although most patients with early lesions can be cured by either
radiation therapy or surgery, radiation therapy may be reasonable to preserve
the voice, leaving surgery for salvage. Patients with a preradiation
hemoglobin level higher than 13 g/dL have higher local control
and survival rates than patients who are anemic.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]

Locally advanced lesions are treated with combined modality treatment involving radiation and chemotherapy with or without surgery. The aim is laryngeal preservation in appropriately selected candidates.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)] Distant metastases are also common, even if the primary
tumor is controlled.

Intermediate lesions have intermediate prognoses, depending on the site, T stage,
N stage, and performance status. Therapy recommendations for patients with
these lesions are based on a variety of complex anatomical, clinical, and social
factors, which should be individualized and discussed in multidisciplinary
consultation (surgery, radiation therapy, and dental and oral surgery) prior to
prescribing therapy.

### Follow-Up and Survivorship

Second
primary tumors, often in the aerodigestive tract, have been reported in as many as
25% of patients whose initial lesion is controlled. A study has shown that
daily treatment of these patients with moderate doses of isotretinoin
(i.e., 13-cis-retinoic acid) for 1 year can significantly reduce the incidence of
second tumors.[[9](#cit/section_1.9)] No survival advantage has been demonstrated, partially because of recurrence and death from the primary malignancy.

Patients treated for laryngeal cancers are at the highest risk of recurrence in the
first 2 to 3 years. Recurrences after 5 years are rare and usually represent
new primary malignancies. Close, regular follow-up is crucial to maximize the
chance for salvage. Follow-up includes careful clinical examination and repetition of any
abnormal staging study, along with attention to any
treatment-related toxic effect or complication.

## Cellular Classification of Laryngeal Cancer

Most laryngeal cancers are of squamous cell histology.
Squamous cell subtypes include keratinizing and nonkeratinizing and well-differentiated to poorly differentiated grade. A variety of nonsquamous cell
laryngeal cancers also occur.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] These are not staged using the American Joint
Cancer Committee staging system, and their management, which is not discussed here, can
differ from that of squamous cell laryngeal cancers. *In situ* squamous cell
carcinoma of the larynx is usually managed by a conservative surgical procedure
such as mucosal stripping or superficial laser excision. Radiation therapy may
also be appropriate treatment of selected patients with *in situ* carcinoma of
the glottic larynx.

## Stage Information for Laryngeal Cancer

The staging system for laryngeal cancer is clinical and based on the best possible estimate of the
extent of disease before treatment. The assessment of the primary tumor is
based on inspection and palpation, when possible, and by fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Panendoscopy under anesthesia ensures careful clinical examination to determine clinical extent of local disease. The tumor must be confirmed
histologically, and any other pathological data obtained on biopsy may be
included. Head and neck magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography-computed tomography
should be done before therapy to supplement inspection and palpation.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]
Additional radiographic studies may be included. The appropriate nodal
drainage areas in the neck should be examined by careful palpation.

### Definitions of TNM

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has designated staging by TNM
(tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define laryngeal cancer.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)]

## Treatment Option Overview for Laryngeal Cancer

### Surgery and/or Radiation Therapy

Surgery and radiation therapy have been the standard treatments for laryngeal cancer. However, outcome data from randomized trials are limited. Studies have attempted to evaluate the use of surgery or radiation but have been underpowered.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] Selection of primary surgery versus radiation therapy–based treatment should be made in a multidisciplinary setting with consideration of disease stage, comorbidities, and functional status, including voice and swallowing outcomes and lung capacity.

Small superficial cancers without laryngeal fixation or lymph node involvement
are successfully treated by radiation therapy or surgery alone, including laser
excision surgery. Radiation therapy may be selected to preserve the voice
and to reserve surgery for salvaging failures. The radiation field and dose are
determined by the location and size of the primary tumor. A variety of
curative surgical procedures are also recommended for laryngeal cancers, some
of which preserve vocal function. An appropriate surgical procedure must be
considered for each patient, given the anatomical problem, performance status,
and clinical expertise of the treatment team. Advanced laryngeal cancers are
often treated by combining radiation with concurrent chemotherapy for larynx preservation and total laryngectomy for bulky T4 disease or salvage.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)-[4](#cit/section_4.4)]

Evaluation of treatment outcome can be reported in various ways: locoregional
control, disease-free survival, determinate survival, and overall survival (OS) at 2
to 5 years. Preservation of voice is an important parameter to evaluate.
Outcome should be reported after initial surgery, initial radiation, planned
combined treatment, or surgical salvage of radiation failures. Primary source
material should be consulted to review these differences.

A review of published clinical
results of definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer suggests a
significant loss of local control when radiation therapy
was prolonged. Extending standard treatment schedules should be
avoided whenever possible.[[5](#cit/section_4.5),[6](#cit/section_4.6)]

Radiation therapy has not been directly compared with endolaryngeal surgery (with or without laser) for the treatment of patients with early-stage laryngeal cancer. The evidence is insufficient to show a clear difference in local control or OS for these two treatment options. Retrospective data suggest that, compared with surgery, radiation therapy might cause less perturbation of voice quality without a significant difference in patient perception.[[7](#cit/section_4.7)]

### Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy

Concurrent chemoradiation therapy is a standard treatment option for patients with locally advanced (stage III and stage IV) laryngeal cancer.

Evidence (concurrent chemoradiation therapy):

1. A meta-analysis of 93 randomized prospective head and neck cancer trials published between 1965 and
2000 showed the following:[[8](#cit/section_4.8)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- The subset of patients
receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy had a 4.5% absolute survival advantage.
- Patients who received concurrent chemotherapy had a greater survival benefit than those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
2. In a randomized trial of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, curative-intent radiation therapy alone (213 patients) was compared with radiation therapy plus weekly cetuximab (211 patients).[[9](#cit/section_4.9)] The initial dose of cetuximab was 400 mg/m2 of body-surface area 1 week before radiation therapy was started, followed by a weekly dose of 250 mg/m2 of body-surface area for the duration of the radiation therapy. This study allowed altered-fractionation regimens to be used in both arms.[[9](#cit/section_4.9),[10](#cit/section_4.10)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- At a median follow-up of 54 months, patients treated with cetuximab and radiation therapy demonstrated significantly higher progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] for disease progression or death, 0.70; *P* = .006).
- Patients in the cetuximab arm experienced higher rates of acneiform rash and infusion reactions, although the incidence of other grade 3 or higher toxicities, including mucositis, did not differ significantly between the two groups.

For more information about oral toxicities, see [Oral Complications of Cancer Therapies](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq).

### Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy

In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials, a total of 1,022 patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer were randomly assigned to receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy with TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil [5-FU]) followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy or concurrent chemoradiation therapy alone. The analysis failed to show an OS (HR, 1.01; 95% confidence limits [CLs], 0.84–1.21; *P* = .92) or PFS (HR, 0.91; 95% CLs, 0.75–1.1; *P* = .32) advantage for neoadjuvant chemotherapy using the TPF regimen over concurrent chemoradiation therapy alone.[[11](#cit/section_4.11)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Evidence (neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy):

1. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Laryngeal Cancer Study Group directly compared chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy versus up-front surgery with postoperative radiation therapy. A total of 332 patients were randomly assigned to either three cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) and radiation therapy or surgery and radiation therapy.[[12](#cit/section_4.12)]

- After two cycles of chemotherapy, the clinical tumor response was complete in 31% of the patients, and there was a partial response in 54% of the patients. Survival was similar in both arms; however, larynx preservation was possible in 64% of the patients in the chemotherapy-followed-by-radiation therapy arm.
2. The VA study was followed by a randomized study, [RTOG 9111](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002496) (NCT00002496), in which the laryngeal preservation arm of the VA study was compared with the concurrent chemoradiation therapy and radiation therapy-alone arms. The primary end point was laryngectomy-free survival.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] RTOG 9111 evaluated 547 patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer who were enrolled between August 1992 and May 2000, with a median follow-up for surviving patients of 10.8 years (range, 0.07–17 years). Three regimens were compared, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy, concurrent chemoradiation therapy, and radiation therapy alone.

- Both chemotherapy regimens improved laryngectomy-free survival compared with radiation therapy alone (neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs. radiation therapy alone, HR, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59–0.95; *P* = .02; concurrent chemotherapy vs. radiation therapy alone, HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98; *P* = .03).
- Concurrent radiation therapy plus cisplatin resulted in a statistically significantly higher percentage of patients with an intact larynx at 10 years (67.5% for patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 81.7% for patients who had concurrent chemotherapy; and 63.8% for patients who received radiation therapy alone); 80% of laryngectomies were performed during the first 2 years (84 laryngectomies during year 1 and 35 laryngectomies during year 2).
- Concurrent cisplatin with radiation therapy resulted in a 41% reduction in risk of locoregional failure compared with radiation therapy alone (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43–0.82; *P* = .0015) and a 34% reduction in risk compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.92; *P* = .004). Both chemotherapy regimens had a lower incidence of distant metastases, although this did not reach statistical significance compared with radiation therapy alone.
- The 10-year cumulative rates of late toxicity (grades 3–5) were 30.6% for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 33.3% for concurrent chemotherapy, and 38% for radiation therapy alone, and were not significantly different between the arms.
- OS was not significantly different between the groups, although there was possibly a worse outcome in the concurrent groups compared with the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.98–1.61; *P* = .08). The OS rates were 58% (5 year) and 39% (10 year) for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 55% (5 year) and 28% (10 year) for concurrent chemoradiation therapy, and 54% (5 year) and 32% (10 year) for radiation therapy alone.
- The number of deaths not attributed to larynx cancer or treatment were higher with concurrent chemotherapy (30.8% vs. 20.8% with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 16.9% with radiation alone), because after approximately 4.5 years, the survival curves began to separate and favor neoadjuvant chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant.

#### Fluorouracil dosing

The *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14)] Patients with the *DPYD\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)-[15](#cit/section_4.15)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)-[18](#cit/section_4.18)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]

### Altered Fractionation Versus Standard Fractionation Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy alone with altered fractionation may be used for patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer who are not candidates for chemotherapy. Altered fractionation radiation therapy yields a higher locoregional control rate compared with standard fractionated radiation therapy for patients with stage III and stage IV head and neck cancer.

Evidence (altered fractionation vs. standard fractionation radiation therapy):

1. The randomized [RTOG-9003](/clinicaltrials/NCT00771641) trial (NCT00771641) included four radiation therapy treatment arms:[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[22](#cit/section_4.22)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Standard fractionation (SFX) to 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions for 7 weeks.
- Hyperfractionation (HFX) to 81.6 Gy in 68 twice-daily fractions for 7 weeks.
- Accelerated fractionation split course (AFX-S) to 67.2 Gy in 42 fractions for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest after 38.4 Gy.
- Accelerated concurrent boost fractionation (AFX-C) to 72 Gy in 42 fractions for 6 weeks.

In a long-term analysis, the three investigational arms were compared with SFX.

- Only the HFX arm showed superior locoregional control and survival at 5 years compared with the SFX arm (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–1.00; *P* = .05).
- AFX-C was associated with increased late toxicity compared with SFX.
2. The following results were shown in a meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials with a total of 6,515 patients and a median follow-up of 6 years involving the assessment of HFX or AFX-S for patients with stage III and stage IV oropharyngeal cancer:[[23](#cit/section_4.23)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- There was a significant survival benefit with altered-fractionated radiation therapy and a 3.4% absolute benefit at 5 years (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.97; *P* = .003).
- Altered-fractionation radiation therapy improves locoregional control, with greater benefit shown in younger patients.
- HFX demonstrated a greater survival benefit (8% at 5 years) than did AFX-S (2% with accelerated fractionation without total dose-reduction and 1.7% with total dose-reduction at 5 years; *P* = .02).

An additional late effect from radiation therapy is hypothyroidism, which occurs in 30% to 40% of patients who have received external-beam radiation therapy to the
entire thyroid gland. Thyroid function testing of
patients is a consideration before therapy and as part of posttreatment
follow-up.[[24](#cit/section_4.24),[25](#cit/section_4.25)]

Prospective data from two randomized controlled trials reported the incidence of hypothyroidism.[[26](#cit/section_4.26)]

- At a median follow-up of 41 months, 55.1% of the patients developed hypothyroidism (39.3% subclinical, 15.7% biochemical).
- Patients who underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) had higher subclinical hypothyroidism (51.1% vs. 27.3%; *P* = .021), peaking around 1 year after radiation therapy.
- Younger age, hypopharynx/larynx primary, node positivity, higher dose/fraction (IMRT arm), and D100 were statistically significant factors for developing hypothyroidism.[[26](#cit/section_4.26)][[Level of evidence A3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810021&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

For patients with well-lateralized oropharyngeal cancer, such as a T1 or T2 tonsil primary tumor with limited extension into the palate or tongue base and limited ipsilateral lymph node involvement without extracapsular extension, elective treatment to the ipsilateral lymph nodes results in only minimal risk of spread to the contralateral neck.[[27](#cit/section_4.27)] For T3 and T4 tumors that are midline or approach the midline, bilateral nodal treatment is a consideration. In addition to the cervical lymph node chain, retropharyngeal lymph nodes can also be encompassed in the elective nodal treatment.

### Surgery Followed by Postoperative Radiation Therapy (PORT) With or Without Chemotherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced Disease

New
surgical techniques for resection and reconstruction that provide access and functional preservation have
extended the surgical options for patients with stage III or stage IV laryngeal cancer. Specific surgical procedures and their modifications
are not described here because of the wide variety of
surgical approaches, the variety of opinions about the role of modified neck
dissections, and the multiple reconstructive
techniques that may give the same results. This group of patients is
managed by head and neck surgeons who are skilled in the multiple procedures available and are actively and frequently involved in the care of these patients.

Depending on pathological findings after primary surgery, PORT with or without chemotherapy is used in the adjuvant setting for the following histological findings:

- T4 disease.
- Perineural invasion.
- Lymphovascular invasion.
- Positive margins or margins less than 5 mm.
- Extracapsular extension of a lymph node.
- Two or more involved lymph nodes.

The addition of chemotherapy to PORT for laryngeal cancer squamous cell carcinoma demonstrates a locoregional control and OS benefit compared with radiation therapy alone in patients who have high-risk pathological risk factors, extracapsular extension of a lymph node, or positive margins, based on a pooled analysis of the [EORTC-22931](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002555) [NCT00002555] and [RTOG-9501](/clinicaltrials/NCT00002670) [NCT00002670] studies.[[28](#cit/section_4.28)-[31](#cit/section_4.31)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

For patients with intermediate pathological risk factors, the addition of cisplatin chemotherapy given concurrently with PORT is unclear. Intermediate pathological risk factors include:

- T3 and T4 disease (or stage III and stage IV disease).
- Perineural infiltration.
- Vascular embolisms.
- Clinically enlarged level IV–V lymph nodes secondary to tumors arising in the oral cavity or oropharynx.
- Two or more histopathologically involved lymph nodes without extracapsular extension.
- Close margins less than 5 mm.

The addition of cetuximab with radiation therapy in the postoperative setting for these intermediate pathological risk factors is being tested in a randomized trial ([RTOG-0920](/clinicaltrials/NCT00956007) [NCT00956007]).

The incidence of lymph node metastases in patients with stage I glottic cancer
ranges from 0% to 2%; for more advanced disease, such as stage II, 10%; and for stage
III glottic, 15%. Thus, there is
no need to treat glottic cancer cervical lymph nodes electively in patients
with stage I tumors and small stage II tumors. Elective neck radiation is a consideration for T3 or T4 glottic tumors or T1 to T4 supraglottic tumors.[[32](#cit/section_4.32)]

For patients with cancer of the subglottis, combined modality therapy is
generally preferred for the uncommon small lesions (i.e., stage I or stage
II); however, radiation therapy alone may be used.

Patients who smoke during radiation therapy appear to have lower response rates
and shorter survival durations than those who do not.[[33](#cit/section_4.33)] Such patients
should be counseled on smoking cessation before beginning radiation therapy.

## Treatment of Stage I Laryngeal Cancer

### Supraglottis

Treatment options for stage I cancer of the supraglottis include:

1. External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) therapy alone.
2. Supraglottic laryngectomy. Total laryngectomy may be reserved for patients
unable to tolerate potential respiratory complications of surgery or the
supraglottic laryngectomy.

### Glottis

Treatment options for stage I cancer of the glottis include:

1. Radiation therapy.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[4](#cit/section_5.4)]
2. Endoscopic CO2 laser excision.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)]
3. Cordectomy for very carefully selected patients with limited and superficial
T1 lesions.[[6](#cit/section_5.6),[7](#cit/section_5.7)]
4. Partial or hemilaryngectomy or total laryngectomy, depending on anatomical
considerations.

### Subglottis

Treatment options for stage I cancer of the subglottis include:

1. Lesions can be treated successfully by radiation therapy alone with
preservation of normal voice.
2. Surgery is reserved for failure of radiation
therapy or for patients who cannot be easily assessed for radiation therapy.

For more information, see the [Treatment Option Overview for Laryngeal Cancer](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_66) section.

**Radiation therapy**

**Transoral CO2 laser excision versus EBRT**

Selection of treatment should include an evaluation of voice function and quality after treatment. Endoscopic CO2 laser resections may also achieve similar results in terms of local control and function [[8](#cit/section_5.8)] compared with radiation therapy, although no randomized studies have been performed.[[9](#cit/section_5.9)]

Evidence (transoral CO2 laser excision vs. EBRT):

1. A meta-analysis examined oncologic control in 22 consecutive case series.

- No clear differences were demonstrated between transoral CO2 laser excision and EBRT in terms of local control (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51–1.3) and laryngectomy-free survival (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.42–1.66).
- There was a trend for improved posttreatment voice quality with radiation therapy. Transoral CO2 laser–excision surgery dominates radiation therapy from a cost-utility standpoint.[[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence B4](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810033&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

**Conventional radiation therapy versus hypofractionated radiation therapy**

Conventional and hypofractionated radiation therapy regimens have been studied regarding radiation-dose fractionation for patients with early-stage larynx cancer.

Evidence (conventional radiation therapy vs. hypofractionated radiation therapy):

1. In a randomized study of patients with early-stage larynx cancer, patients were assigned to standard fractionation in 2 Gy daily fractions or a hypofractionated regimen of 2.25 Gy daily; 82 patients were allocated to a conventional fractionation (CONV) arm (66 Gy/33 fractions for T1 and 70 Gy/35 fractions for T2), with 74 patients to the hypofractionation (HYPO) arm (63 Gy/28 fractions for T1 and 67.5 Gy/30 fractions for T2).[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] The study was underpowered and closed early because of a lack of accrual, although no statistically significant differences were seen between treatment arms in terms of local progression-free survival (PFS).

- With a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 2–122 months), the 5-year local PFS rate was 77.8% for the CONV arm and 88.5% for the HYPO arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; *P* = .213).
- No significant difference was observed in the toxicity profile between the two arms.
- In a subgroup exploratory analysis for T1a disease, the 5-year local PFS rate trended positively in the HYPO arm (76.7% vs. 93.0%; HR, 3.65; *P* = .056).[[10](#cit/section_5.10)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Earlier single-institution reports support hypofractionated regimens using 2.25 Gy per fraction for early T1 and T2 larynx cancer with high local control rates.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Treatment of Stage II Laryngeal Cancer

### Supraglottis

Treatment options for stage II cancer of the supraglottis include:

1. External-beam radiation therapy alone for the smaller lesions encompassing the primary disease and regional elective nodes.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]
2. Supraglottic laryngectomy with bilateral neck dissections, depending on location of
the lesion, clinical status of the patient, and expertise of the treatment
team. Careful selection must be made to ensure adequate pulmonary and
swallowing function postoperatively.
3. Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is indicated for positive or close
surgical margins or other adverse pathological risk factors.

Radiation therapy should be preferred because
of the good results, preservation of the voice, and the possibility of surgical salvage in
patients whose disease recurs locally.

### Glottis

Treatment options for stage II cancer of the glottis include:

1. Radiation therapy.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)-[4](#cit/section_6.4)]
2. Endoscopic CO2 laser excision.[[5](#cit/section_6.5)]
3. Partial or hemilaryngectomy or total laryngectomy, depending on anatomical
considerations. Under certain circumstances, laser microsurgery may be
appropriate.[[6](#cit/section_6.6)]

### Subglottis

Treatment options for stage II cancer of the subglottis include:

1. Lesions can be treated successfully by radiation therapy alone with
preservation of normal voice.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]
2. Surgery is reserved for failure of
radiation therapy or for patients in whom follow-up is likely to be difficult.

Treatment options for stage III cancer of the supraglottis include:

1. [Concurrent chemoradiation therapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_547) can
be considered for patients who would require total laryngectomy for control of disease.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)]
2. [Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_554). Laryngectomy is reserved for patients with less than a 50% response to chemotherapy or who have persistent disease following radiation.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)-[6](#cit/section_7.6)][[Level of evidence A3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810021&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
3. Definitive radiation therapy alone with [altered fractionation](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_415) in patients who are not candidates for concurrent chemotherapy and surgery (total laryngectomy) for salvage of radiation failures.[[7](#cit/section_7.7)]
4. Surgery with or without postoperative radiation therapy (PORT).[[8](#cit/section_7.8)]

### Glottis

Treatment options for stage III cancer of the glottis include:

1. [Concurrent chemoradiation therapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_547) can
be considered for patients who would require total laryngectomy for control of disease.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)]
2. [Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_554). Laryngectomy is reserved for patients with less than a 50% response to chemotherapy or who have persistent disease after radiation.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)-[6](#cit/section_7.6)]
3. Definitive radiation therapy alone with [altered fractionation](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_415) in patients who are not candidates for concurrent chemotherapy and surgery (total laryngectomy) for salvage of radiation failures.[[7](#cit/section_7.7)]
4. Surgery with or without PORT.[[8](#cit/section_7.8)]
5. Clinical trials exploring novel targeted therapy, immunotherapy, novel chemotherapy, radiosensitizers, or particle-beam radiation therapy.[[9](#cit/section_7.9)]

### Subglottis

Treatment options for stage III cancer of the subglottis include:

1. Laryngectomy plus isolated thyroidectomy and tracheoesophageal node
dissection usually followed by PORT.[[10](#cit/section_7.10)]
2. Treatment by radiation therapy alone is indicated for patients who are not
candidates for surgery. Patients should be closely followed, and surgical
salvage should be planned for recurrences that are local or in the neck.
3. Definitive radiation therapy alone with [altered fractionation](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_415) in patients who are not candidates for concurrent chemotherapy and surgery (total laryngectomy) for salvage of radiation failures.[[6](#cit/section_7.6),[7](#cit/section_7.7)]
4. [Induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemotherapy and radiation](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_554). Laryngectomy is reserved for patients with less than a 50% response to chemotherapy or who have persistent disease after radiation.[[6](#cit/section_7.6)]
5. Clinical trials exploring novel targeted therapy, immunotherapy, novel chemotherapy, radiosensitizers, or particle-beam
radiation therapy.[[9](#cit/section_7.9)]

**Role of Neck Dissection in the Post-Radiation Therapy Setting**

A prospective randomized trial included 564 patients with head and neck cancer and N2 or N3 disease. Patients were assigned to undergo planned neck dissection or surveillance with positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT). With a median follow-up of 36 months, PET-CT resulted in fewer neck dissections compared with the surgical arm (54 vs. 221), with a 2-year survival rate of 84.9% versus 81.5%, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR)death slightly favored PET-CT–guided surveillance and indicated noninferiority (upper boundary, 95% confidence interval for HR, <1.50; *P* = .004).[[11](#cit/section_7.11)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## Treatment of Metastatic and Recurrent Laryngeal Cancer

### Treatment Options for Metastatic and Recurrent Laryngeal Cancer

Treatment options for metastatic and recurrent laryngeal cancer include:

1. Surgery [[1](#cit/section_9.1)] and/or radiation therapy. Salvage is possible for failures of surgery alone or of radiation therapy alone,
and further surgery [[1](#cit/section_9.1)] and/or radiation therapy should be attempted, as indicated.
Selected patients may be candidates for partial laryngectomy after high-dose
radiation therapy has failed.[[2](#cit/section_9.2)]
2. Radiation therapy. Re-irradiation for laryngeal salvage
following radiation therapy failure has resulted in long-term survival in a
small number of patients; it may be considered for small recurrences after
radiation therapy, especially in patients who refuse or are not candidates for
laryngectomy.[[3](#cit/section_9.3)]
3. [Chemotherapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_655).
4. [Immunotherapy](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_664).

- [Pembrolizumab](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_727).
- [Nivolumab](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_728).
5. Clinical trials for patients whose disease does not respond to combined radiation therapy and
surgery.

For more information, see the [Treatment Option Overview for Laryngeal Cancer](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq#_66) section.

#### Chemotherapy

Platinum-based chemotherapy is often used as first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. A response of variable duration may be achieved after
systemic chemotherapy.[[4](#cit/section_9.4)]

Evidence (chemotherapy):

1. In a phase III randomized trial of 442 patients with untreated metastatic or recurrent SCC of the head and neck, adding cetuximab to platinum plus fluorouracil (5-FU) compared with platinum plus 5-FU alone improved overall survival (OS), with a median survival of 10.1 months versus 7.4 months (hazard ratio [HR]death, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64–0.99; *P* = .04).[[5](#cit/section_9.5)]

- Quality of life was not adversely affected by adding cetuximab to this platinum-based regimen.[[6](#cit/section_9.6)]

Tumor *EGFR* gene copy number was not found to be a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab plus platinum and 5-FU as first-line therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic SCC of the head and neck.[[7](#cit/section_9.7)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
2. A phase III, open-label, randomized trial demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients who received afatinib compared with patients who received methotrexate.[[8](#cit/section_9.8)]

1. After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI, 2.0–2.7) for the afatinib group and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.5–2.4) for the methotrexate group (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.98; *P* = .030).
2. The most frequent grade 3 or grade 4 drug-related adverse events for patients treated with afatinib or methotrexate included:

- Rash or acne (10% for afatinib vs. 0% for methotrexate).
- Diarrhea (9% for afatinib vs. 2% for methotrexate).
- Stomatitis (6% for afatinib vs. 8% for methotrexate).
- Fatigue (6% for afatinib vs. 3% for methotrexate).
- Neutropenia (<1% for afatinib vs. 7% for methotrexate).
3. Overall serious adverse events occurred in 14% of patients treated with afatinib and 11% of patients treated with methotrexate.

#### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy (inhibitor of the programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] pathway) can be used after platinum-based failure in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent disease.[[9](#cit/section_9.9),[10](#cit/section_9.10)]

###### Pembrolizumab

Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody and an inhibitor of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway. Studies have evaluated pembrolizumab in patients with incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Evidence (pembrolizumab as first-line therapy):

1. [KEYNOTE-048](/clinicaltrials/NCT02358031) (NCT02358031) was a nonblinded, randomized, phase III study of participants with untreated locally incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC that was performed at 200 sites in 37 countries.[[11](#cit/section_9.11)] A total of 882 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab alone (n = 301), pembrolizumab plus a platinum and fluorouracil (5-FU) (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy) (n = 281), or cetuximab plus a platinum and 5-FU (cetuximab with chemotherapy) (n = 300). Investigators, patients, and representatives of the sponsor were masked to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) results; PD-L1 positivity was not required for study entry. A total of 754 patients (85%) had a CPS of 1 or higher and 381 patients (43%) had a CPS of 20 or higher.

The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Progression was defined as radiographically confirmed disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, in the intention-to-treat population.

1. At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab alone showed improved or noninferior OS compared with cetuximab with chemotherapy. The median OS results were reported as follows:[[11](#cit/section_9.11)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Among the population with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median OS was 14.9 months in patients who received pembrolizumab alone and 10.7 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45–0.83; *P* = .0007).
- Among the population with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 12.3 months in patients who received pembrolizumab alone and 10.3 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96; *P* = .0086).
- Among the total population, patients who received pembrolizumab alone had noninferior OS (11.6 months) compared with patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (10.7 months) (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.03; *P* = .0456).
2. Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy showed improved OS versus cetuximab with chemotherapy. The OS results were reported as follows:

- At the second interim analysis, among the total population, the median OS was 13.0 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 10.7 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93; *P* = .0034).
- At the final analysis, among the population with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median OS was 14.7 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 11.0 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.82; *P* = .0004).
- At the final analysis, among the population with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 13.6 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 10.4 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.80; *P* < .0001).
3. At the second interim analysis, neither pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved PFS.
4. At the final analysis, grade 3 or higher all-cause adverse events occurred in 164 of 300 patients (55%) in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 235 of 276 patients (85%) who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and 239 of 287 patients (83%) who received cetuximab with chemotherapy.
5. Adverse events led to death in 25 patients (8%) in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 32 patients (12%) who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and 28 patients (10%) who received cetuximab with chemotherapy.

Pembrolizumab plus a platinum and 5-FU is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC. Pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1–positive metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC. These results were confirmed at a longer median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range, 41.0–49.2).[[12](#cit/section_9.12)]

Evidence (pembrolizumab after progression on platinum-based treatment):

1. The phase III [KEYNOTE-040](/clinicaltrials/NCT02252042) (NCT02252042) trial included patients with incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC who had received platinum-based treatment within 3 to 6 months.[[9](#cit/section_9.9)] Patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab arm (200 mg every 3 weeks [247 patients]) or to the standard therapy arm of the investigator’s choice (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab [248 patients]). Patients received treatment until progression or toxicity. The maximum duration of pembrolizumab was 24 months. The primary end point was OS in the intention-to-treat population.

- The median OS was 8.4 months in the pembrolizumab arm and 6.9 months in the standard therapy arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.98; nominal *P* = .0161).[[9](#cit/section_9.9)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- Pembrolizumab was associated with fewer grade 3 or higher adverse events (pembrolizumab, 13% vs. standard therapy, 36%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were hypothyroidism (13%) in the pembrolizumab arm and fatigue (18%) in the standard therapy arm.
- In patients who received pembrolizumab, there were four treatment-related deaths resulting from large intestinal perforation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and unspecified malignant progression. Two treatment-related deaths in the standard therapy arm resulted from malignant progression and pneumonia.
- The PD-L1 CPS was 1 or higher in 79% of the patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 77% of the patients in the standard therapy arm.
- Compared with patients treated with standard therapy, a reduced HRdeath was noted for patients who received pembrolizumab and had PD-1 expression on their tumors or in the tumor microenvironment as noted by a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.93; nominal *P* = .0049) or a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or higher (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.81; nominal *P* = .0014).

###### Nivolumab

Nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

Evidence (nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in patients who have not previously received systemic therapy):

1. The [CheckMate 651](/clinicaltrials/NCT02741570) trial (NCT02741570) evaluated first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME (cetuximab, cisplatin/carboplatin, and 5-FU for up to six cycles followed by cetuximab maintenance) in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.[[13](#cit/section_9.13)] The primary end points were OS in all randomly assigned patients and patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher. Secondary end points included OS in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher and PFS, objective response rate, and duration of response in all randomly assigned patients and patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher.

- Among all randomly assigned patients, there was no statistically significant difference in OS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME (median OS, 13.9 vs. 13.5 months; HR, 0.95; 97.9% CI, 0.80–1.13; *P* = .4951). Among patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher, there was also no statistically significant OS difference between the two treatments (median OS, 17.6 vs. 14.6 months; HR, 0.78; 97.51% CI, 0.59–1.03; *P* = .0469).[[13](#cit/section_9.13)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- In patients with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 15.7 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2 months for patients who received EXTREME (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97).
- Among patients with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median PFS was 5.4 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 7.0 months for patients who received EXTREME. The objective response rate was 34.1% for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.0% for patients who received EXTREME.
- Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 28.2% of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 70.7% of patients who received EXTREME.
- CheckMate 651 did not meet its primary end points of OS in the randomly assigned or CPS of 20 or higher populations.

The absence of a survival benefit for immune checkpoint inhibitors in this trial was an unexpected outcome, given the similarity of nivolumab to pembrolizumab in the studies of patients with cisplatin-refractory disease.[[9](#cit/section_9.9),[10](#cit/section_9.10)] An editorial accompanying the CheckMate 651 trial analyzed some of the factors that may have contributed to a different result. The editorial suggested that survival in the control group, which was longer than that reported in prior studies, may have been impacted by the greater availability of second-line immunotherapy in the control group (46% in CheckMate 651 compared with 25% in the KEYNOTE-048 trial). The authors also suggested that the coadministration of ipilimumab detracted from the activity of nivolumab, as shown in the CheckMate 714 trial.[[14](#cit/section_9.14)]
2. [CheckMate 714](/clinicaltrials/NCT02823574) (NCT02823574), a double-blind phase II trial, evaluated the clinical benefit of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in 425 patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.[[15](#cit/section_9.15)] Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously [IV] every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks) or nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) plus placebo. Treatment continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or consent withdrawal. The primary end points were objective response rate and duration of response between treatment arms by blinded independent central review in the population with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic disease. These were patients who had recurrent disease less than 6 months after completion of platinum-based chemotherapy (adjuvant or neoadjuvant, or as part of multimodal treatment [chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy]). Among the 241 patients (56.7%) with platinum-refractory disease, 159 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 82 were assigned to receive nivolumab alone. Among the 184 patients (43.3%) with platinum-eligible disease, 123 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 61 were assigned to receive nivolumab alone.[[15](#cit/section_9.15)][[Level of evidence B3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810031&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- At primary database lock, the objective response rate in the population with platinum-refractory disease was 13.2% (95% CI, 8.4%–19.5%) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 18.3% (95% CI, 10.6%–28.4%) with nivolumab alone (odds ratio, 0.68; 95.5% CI, 0.33–1.43; *P* = .29).
- The median duration of response was not reached (NR) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group (95% CI, 11.0 months–NR) and was 11.1 months (95% CI, 4.1–NR) in the nivolumab-alone group.
In the population with platinum-eligible disease, the objective response rate was 20.3% (95% CI, 13.6%–28.5%) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 29.5% (95% CI, 18.5%–42.6%) with nivolumab alone.
- Among the population with platinum-refractory disease, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 25 of 158 patients (15.8%) who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 12 of 82 patients (14.6%) who received nivolumab alone. Among the population with platinum-eligible disease, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 30 of 122 patients (24.6%) who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 8 of 61 patients (13.1%) who received nivolumab alone.
- This trial did not meet its primary end point of objective response rate benefit with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in patients with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.

Evidence (nivolumab after progression on platinum-based treatment):

1. A phase III open-label trial included 361 patients with recurrent SCC of the head and neck and disease progression within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was OS.[[10](#cit/section_9.10)]

- The median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.5–9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0–6.0) in the standard therapy group. OS was statistically significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy (HRdeath, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51–0.96; *P* = .01). The estimated 1-year survival rate was approximately 19% higher in patients who received nivolumab (36.0%) than in those who received standard therapy (16.6%).[[10](#cit/section_9.10)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- There was no statistically significant difference in median PFS between treatment groups. The 6-month PFS rate was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy.
- The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard therapy group.
- Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group compared with 35.1% of the patients in the standard therapy group.
- Quality-of-life outcomes—including physical, role, and social functioning and pain, sensory, and social contact problems—were stable in the nivolumab group but worse in the standard therapy group. These outcomes were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Core Module (QLQ-C30) and the Head and Neck Module (QLQ-H&N35).
- In the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 1% or higher, the HRdeath among patients treated with nivolumab versus standard therapy was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.36–0.83). In the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level lower than 1%, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.54–1.45; *P* = .17 for interaction).
2. A randomized, phase III, superiority study in India evaluated the dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of palliative care for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. Low-dose IV nivolumab (20 mg every 3 weeks) was added to a triple metronomic chemotherapy regimen of oral methotrexate (9 mg/m2 once weekly), celecoxib (200 mg twice daily), and erlotinib (150 mg once daily). Notably, this nivolumab dose is less than 10% of the dose recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to receive either triple metronomic chemotherapy alone (n = 75) or triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (n = 76). The primary end point was 1-year OS.[[16](#cit/section_9.16)]

- The addition of low-dose nivolumab to triple metronomic chemotherapy improved the 1-year OS rate from 16.3% (95% CI, 8.0%–27.4%) to 43.4% (95% CI, 30.8%–55.3%) (HR, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.362–0.820; *P* = .0036).[[16](#cit/section_9.16)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- The median OS was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8–8.1) for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy alone and 10.1 months (95% CI, 7.4–12.6) for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (*P* = .0052).
- The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 50% for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy alone and 46.1% for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (*P* = .744).

Although the control arm in this study cannot be considered standard care, lower doses of immunotherapy appeared to have some benefit in this setting.[[17](#cit/section_9.17)]

Salvage after previous combined total laryngectomy and radiation therapy is
