## Overview

[Go to Patient Version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/curcumin-pdq)

This [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information summary provides an overview of the use of [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a treatment for people with cancer.

This summary contains the following key information:

- Curcumin (diarylheptanoid) is one member of a group of natural [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called curcuminoids, derived from the rhizome of *Curcuma longa*, an East Indian plant, contained in an [extract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) commonly called [turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Turmeric has a long history of [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) application in [traditional Asian medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=449722&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Extensive research over the past two decades suggests that curcuminoids, the active ingredient in turmeric (*C. longa*), interfere with multiple [cell signaling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798994&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pathways, providing support for the potential role of curcumin in [modulating](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390300&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) development and [progression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44078&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- With varying formulations and [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tested in [phase I clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), there is evidence of [bioavailability](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44225&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcumin and curcumin conjugates in [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Results from early-phase trials of curcumin-containing products in the [chemoprevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45487&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46462&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [hepatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45709&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) carcinoma appear promising. However, the findings from these early trials have to be confirmed in well-powered trials evaluating safety and effectiveness as indicated by modulation of [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) outcomes.
- Data from early-phase trials of the safety and effectiveness of curcumin-containing products in cancer treatment are at most from [pilot](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45838&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) trials that targeted various [stages](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer and cancer patient populations, and utilized different formulations and [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcumin and durations of [intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454757&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Thus, the evidence is currently inadequate to recommend curcumin-containing products for the treatment of cancer.
- Data from early-phase trials of the safety and effectiveness of curcumin-containing products as adjuncts to traditional cancer [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are from pilot trials that had small sample sizes, targeted various stages of cancer and cancer patient populations, and utilized different formulations and doses of curcumin and durations of intervention. Thus, the evidence is currently inadequate to recommend curcumin-containing products to be used as adjuncts for the treatment of cancer.
- Data from early-phase trials on the use of curcumin formulations to ameliorate cancer treatment–related effects have demonstrated (a) improved oxidative status in patients who received [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), (b) delayed onset and severity of [mucositis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), (c) reduced severity of [radiation dermatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446545&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and (d) improved [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), without [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with curcumin-containing products at these doses. However, these studies were short in duration and used varying doses and formulations of curcumin. Thus, these results should be interpreted with caution. The findings from these early trials have to be confirmed in well-powered trials evaluating safety or effectiveness.

## General Information and History

[Curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a member of the diarylheptanoid class of natural products (curcuminoids) derived from the rhizome of *Curcuma longa* L., an East Indian plant, commonly called [turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The other major curcuminoids present in turmeric are demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and cyclocurcumin; together, they are termed the **curcuminoid complex**. The turmeric plant and preparations derived from it have a long history of [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) application in [traditional Asian medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=449722&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The crude and often dried plant material is widely consumed as a food additive, as part of curry spices, which typically contain numerous other ingredients. Turmeric and its preparations also have a long history of use as [herbal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), primarily to treat various [inflammatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373080&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Significant confusion exists in the scientific biomedical literature, as well as the popular literature, about the meaning of curcumin. Consequently, one group has developed a classification scheme that is described below.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]

Several companies distribute curcumin as a dietary supplement. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [(FDA)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may [adulterate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot. In addition, there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present at all or are present in the specified amounts. The FDA has not approved the use of curcumin as a treatment for cancer or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

**Caution/Awareness Notice: Several cases of severe liver toxicity have occurred in Europe and the United States after consumption of products that were labeled as containing curcumin.[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3)] These toxic events may be the result of contamination with toxins known to be in some of these products and/or adulteration or individual patient susceptibility. Various organizations, including international government regulatory agencies, have released cautionary safety advisory notices regarding curcumin-containing products.**

### Categories of Curcumin-Type Products

The materials that have received the moniker **curcumin** may be divided into five categories:

1. Turmeric (T): Raw *C. longa* rhizomes.
2. Turmeric [extract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TE): A [solvent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463162&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) extract of dried or fresh *C. longa* rhizomes.
3. Curcuminoids-enriched turmeric extract (CTE): Typically the deep-yellow precipitate collected from the solvent extract upon [concentration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683342&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) under reduced temperature.
4. Curcuminoids-enriched material (CEM): Obtained by additional, often large-scale, chromatographic purification of CTE.
5. Curcumin (CUR): A single-chemical entity, in a purity that is commensurate with that of a validated and/or metrological reference material.

It is important to note that materials often referred to as **curcumin** are not identical to the pure, single-chemical entity. Because of the deficiency in the adequate chemical characterization of the immense diversity of crude turmeric (T), extracts (CE), enriched materials (CTE, CEM), and even materials considered *pure*, augmented by the fact that the materials often share the same name (curcumin), the usefulness of the [biological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44510&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) data acquired from the plethora of these preparations is questionable.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] Furthermore, attributing biological activity of a complex mixture solely to the major component, however prominent, is problematic.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)]

This summary refers to all turmeric-derived [intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454757&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) materials by using the collective term, curcumin-containing products. Tables at the end of each section specify the exact intervention material used in each cited study.

## Laboratory/Preclinical Studies

Extensive research over the past two decades suggests that curcuminoids belonging to the diferuloylmethane class of natural products, the major constituents in [turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (*Curcuma longa*), interfere with multiple [cell signaling](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798994&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pathways, which provides support for the potential role of [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in modulating [carcinogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46487&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These pathways include the following:[[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[12](#cit/section_3.12)]

- [Cell cycle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597111&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([cyclin D1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=729820&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and cyclin E).
- [Apoptosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46524&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (activation of caspases and down-regulation of [antiapoptotic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390240&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) products).
- Proliferation ([human epidermal growth factor receptor-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793177&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [HER-2], [epidermal growth factor receptor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45680&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [EGFR], and activating protein-1 [AP-1]).
- Survival ([phosphoinositide 3-kinase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=530323&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [PI3K]/[protein kinase B](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653106&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [AKT]) invasion ([matrix metallopeptidase-9](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44211&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [MMP-9] and adhesion [molecules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- [Angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([vascular endothelial growth factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44222&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [VEGF]).
- [Metastasis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46710&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CXC-chemokine receptor-4 [CXCR-4]).
- [Inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([nuclear factor-kappa B](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=773861&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [NF-kappa B], [tumor necrosis factor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44471&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [TNF], [interleukin- 1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=350231&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [IL-1], interleukin-8 [IL-8], interleukin-12 [IL-12], [cyclooxygenase-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=559451&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [COX-2], and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX]).

While these reports can possibly provide support for the potential role of curcumin-containing products in modulating carcinogenesis, definitive conclusions cannot be made, especially in light of the widespread confusion and/or misconception regarding the [chemical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) nature of curcumin-containing products outlined above.

Because of the abundance of *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* and [preclinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) investigating the [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) potential of curcumin-containing products. These clinical trials have used varying formulations and [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcuminoids for the [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment of cancer and to ameliorate [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment. This summary will focus on the [bioavailability](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44225&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), safety, and effectiveness of curcumin-containing products reported in clinical trials that targeted individuals at high risk of cancer and cancer patients for the prevention and treatment of cancer and ameliorating the symptoms of cancer treatment.

## Human/Clinical Studies

### Bioavailability of Curcumin-Containing Products (Phase I Clinical Trials)

At least six [phase I clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-containing products have investigated the [pharmacokinetics](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and pharmacodynamics of pure curcumin (CUR) alone in humans. These studies have shown that [systemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) exposure to curcumin-containing products at [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of up to 8,000 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/day was safe and tolerable and did not cause serious adverse events. In these studies, the peak [serum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44088&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [concentrations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683342&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ranged from 47 ng/[mL](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (at a dose of 200 mg of [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) curcumin daily) to 1,380 ng/mL (at a dose of 8,000 mg of oral curcumin daily).[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[6](#cit/section_4.6)]

These concentrations refer to **total curcumin**, meaning that studies do not differentiate between free (unconjugated) curcumin and curcumin conjugated with [glucuronic acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648598&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or sulfate. Conjugated curcumin is the more abundant metabolite in circulation. While studies indicate that conjugated curcumin is less bioactive than free curcumin, there are also indications for the enzymatic release of free curcumin from the conjugated forms at sites of [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[7](#cit/section_4.7),[8](#cit/section_4.8)]

The [assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcuminoid [bioavailability](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44225&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including that of CUR, is confounded by the pronounced [metabolic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44056&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and (photo)chemical instability of these [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Because of the varying preparations, formulations, and doses of [intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454757&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) materials tested in the [phase I clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), it is unclear which curcumin-containing products and doses of CUR and/or other constituents of *Curcuma longa* are required to produce a clinically significant modulation of [biomarkers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45618&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or even [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [outcomes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The general consensus that the [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels of CUR required to achieve any [biological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44510&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects in patients are much higher than what has been observed clinically to date. Studies have directly compared the bioavailability of unformulated curcumin-containing preparations with CUR that is formulated for enhanced bioavailability. These studies have consistently shown an increase in plasma levels using formulated CUR; however, these levels are still relatively low and do not exceed [therapeutically](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) insufficient concentrations.[[9](#cit/section_4.9),[10](#cit/section_4.10)]

### Cancer Prevention and Treatment of Precancerous Lesions

Investigations into products that may aid in the [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the treatment of [precancerous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46220&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are important for the development of early [intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454757&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) strategies and treatments. A few studies have investigated the potential [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) benefit of [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-containing products, and other studies are under way. See [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "https://clinicaltrials.gov/").

#### Colorectal cancer

Researchers have explored curcumin’s potential in curcumin-containing products for the prevention of [colon cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) through its effects on precancerous lesions.

Published results (curcumin-containing product for prevention of colon cancer):

1. One small study (N = 5) assessed patients with [familial adenomatous polyposis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45100&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FAP). The patients, all of whom had previous colectomies (four patients with retained [rectums](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and one patient with an ileal [anal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44185&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pouch), received 480 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcumin and 20 mg of quercetin 3 times per day [orally](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for 6 months.[[11](#cit/section_4.11)]

- At 3 months, four of five patients had a decrease in [polyp](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45844&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) number and size from [baseline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- At 6 months, this decrease continued for four of the patients, one patient was lost to [follow-up](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after 3 months of treatment.
2. This same group conducted a controlled trial of 100% pure CUR (1,500 mg orally, 2 times/day) in a similar population of individuals with FAP (N = 44; [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) = 23; curcumin = 21).[[12](#cit/section_4.12)]

- Results of this study contradicted previous findings. No significant difference was found between the two treatment arms in this study.
3. A third study that investigated oral curcumin used 2 doses (2,000 mg and 4,000 mg) of curcuminoid-containing powder (98%) given orally once daily for 30 days.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)] The study investigated the potential [efficacy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcumin-containing products in reducing the concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) (procarcinogenic factors) within [aberrant crypt foci](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=524194&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ACF) ([primary endpoint](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44163&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and associated normal [mucosa](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The secondary [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) included total ACF number (visible on [endoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45678&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and an estimate of proliferation in normal mucosa using the proliferation marker Ki-67. Forty patients were evaluable, with 20 participants in each dose group.[[13](#cit/section_4.13)]

- There was no significant decrease in primary or secondary endpoints in either group of patients, except for a 40% decrease in the number of ACF in the group of patients who received 4,000 mg doses.
- The ACF reduction in the 4,000 mg group was associated with a significant, five-fold increase in posttreatment [plasma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45839&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) curcumin and conjugate levels.

#### Head and neck cancer

Treatment of patients with oral [leukoplakia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45954&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) using a curcumin-containing product was investigated in a [randomized trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[14](#cit/section_4.14)]

Published results (curcumin-containing product to treat oral leukoplakia):

1. In one trial, 223 patients with oral leukoplakia were randomly assigned to receive either 3,600 mg of an oral curcumin-containing product (N = 111) or a placebo (N = 112) twice daily after food for 6 months.[[14](#cit/section_4.14)] The intervention material contained a curcuminoid-enriched material (CEM) reconstituted with [turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) oil and dispensed in capsules (BCM95–Biocurcumax). Clinical [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (primary endpoint) was determined by measurement of leukoplakia at [baseline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and at 6 months. At 6 months, 213 patients were evaluable (curcumin, N = 105; placebo, N = 108).

- Of these patients, complete or [partial responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45819&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were observed in 75 patients from the curcumin-containing product group and in 62 patients from the placebo group (a [statistically significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44167&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) difference).
- One hundred three patients with a clinical response at 6 months continued the curcumin-containing product or placebo treatment to evaluate long-term treatment effects.
- There was no statistically significant difference between treatment arms at 12 months, suggesting no additional benefits with treatment longer than 6 months.
- Histological response (complete reversal of dysplasia/hyperplasia vs. partial reversal vs. no response vs. increased severity; secondary endpoint) between the groups was not significant, but combined histological and clinical response showed a significantly better response to the curcumin-containing product.

#### Multiple myeloma

The effect of a curcumin-containing product was investigated in patients with [monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=411379&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (MGUS) or [smoldering multiple myeloma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=413932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (SMM).

Published results (effectiveness of curcumin-containing product on MGUS and SMM):

1. A [double-blind](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45673&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [crossover study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797424&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) followed by an [open-label](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285990&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) extension study explored the effectiveness of a curcumin-containing product in patients with MGUS or SMM. Thirty-six patients (19 with MGUS and 17 with SMM) were randomly assigned to receive either 4,000 mg of the curcumin-containing product (curcumin stick-pack contained 3,600 mg of curcumin, 320 mg of demethoxycurcumin, and 80 mg of bisdemethoxycurcumin; one-half in the morning and one-half in the evening as a divided dose) or 4,000 mg of placebo, crossing over at 3 months. At completion of the first study, patients were given the option to begin the open-label 8,000 mg dose-extension study. Twenty-five patients (9 with SMM and 16 with MGUS) completed the crossover study and 18 patients (7 with SMM and 11 with MGUS) completed the extension study.[[15](#cit/section_4.15)]

- Serum [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) revealed decreases in free light-chain ratio (rFLC); a difference between clonal and nonclonal light-chain (dFLC) and involved free light-chain (iFLC) was observed but not statistically significant in patients who received the curcumin-containing product in the crossover study.
- In patients who received the placebo and then crossed over to receive the curcumin-containing product, no significant changes occurred after crossover. Urinary deoxypyridinoline (uDPYD), a marker of bone resorption, decreased in the curcumin-containing product arm and increased in the placebo arm.
- Significant decrease in rFLC and uDPYD occurred in the open-label study.

#### Hepatoma (liver cancer)

The efficacy and safety of curcumin-containing products have been studied in patients with nonalcoholic fatty [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease (NAFLD).

Published results (effectiveness of curcumin-containing product on NAFLD):

1. A study evaluated the efficacy and safety of supplementation with a phytosomal curcumin-containing product in patients with NAFLD (grades 1–3 according to liver [ultrasonography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45557&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) These patients were randomly assigned to receive either the curcumin-containing product (phytosomal form; 1,000 mg/day in 2 divided doses; N = 50) or the placebo (N = 52) for a period of 8 weeks.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)]

- Results indicated that supplementation with the curcumin-containing product was associated with a reduction in [body mass index](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455136&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (-0.99 ± 1.25 in the curcumin-containing product group vs.  -0.15 ± 1.31 in the placebo group; *P* = .003) and waist circumference (1.74 ± 2.58 in the curcumin-containing product group vs. -0.23 ± 3.49 in the placebo group; *P* = .024).
- Ultrasonographic findings were improved in 75.0% of patients in the curcumin-containing product group, while the rate of improvement in the [control group](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was 4.7% (*P* < .001).
- Serum levels of [aspartate aminotransferase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=372942&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (AST) and [alanine aminotransferase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=372944&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ALT) were reduced by the end of the trial in the patients in the curcumin-containing product group (*P* < .001) but elevated in the patients in the control group (*P* < .001).
- The curcumin-containing product was safe and well-tolerated during the trial.
2. A 2019 [meta-analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691484&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) examined four randomized [controlled trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44014&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that included 228 patients.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)]

- Results indicated a trend toward significant reduction of ALT [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) concentrations in a subgroup of patients who received ≥1,000 mg/day of curcumin-containing product supplementation (-11.36 IU/L; 95% confidence interval [CI], -22.75 to 0.02; I2: 51%).
- The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of AST levels in patients who received curcumin-containing products in studies with 8 weeks of [administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (-9.22 IU/L; 95% CI, -12.77 to -5.67; I2: 49%).

Based on these findings, the authors suggested that curcumin-containing products, at higher dosages, might have a favorable effect on patients with NAFLD.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)]

### Cancer Treatment

#### Biomarker studies

[Biomarkers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45618&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have long been used to identify and understand the [etiology](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46410&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of various diseases. In [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) research, there are different types of cancer biomarkers. Prognostic biomarkers determine the likely [outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the disease and if further treatment is warranted and predictive biomarkers ascertain the likelihood the disease will [respond](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treatment.[[18](#cit/section_4.18)]

Five [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been performed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-containing products on predictive biomarkers in patients with different types of cancer. Various biomarkers from these studies were evaluated as potential [efficacy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) measures to ascertain the usefulness of curcumin-containing products alone and as an [adjunctive therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44144&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Different curcumin-containing products were used. Curcuminoid [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used in these studies ranged from 20 mg/day to 3,000 mg/day. One of the studies did not identify the amount of curcuminoids administered, but used 5 g of [turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) powder dissolved in 150 mL of milk 3 times/day.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)]

The main biomarkers used in these studies were [serum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44088&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels of the following:

- Total [antioxidant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) capacity (TAC).[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]
- Superoxide dismutase (SOD).[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]
- [Glutathione](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373010&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) peroxidase (GPx).[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]
- [Tumor necrosis factor-alpha](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45290&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (TNF-alpha).[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[22](#cit/section_4.22)]
- Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).[[22](#cit/section_4.22)]
- [Interleukin-6](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44045&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (IL-6).[[22](#cit/section_4.22)]
- [Cyclooxygenase-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=559451&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (COX-2).[[23](#cit/section_4.23)]
- Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).[[23](#cit/section_4.23)]
- Nitric oxide.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)]
- Histological expression of p53 on cancer [cells.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [[21](#cit/section_4.21)]

Results from four of the studies indicated an association between a positive change in a biomarker and patient outcome as follows:

- TAC increased and SOD decreased.[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]
- p53 expression increased and TNF-alpha decreased.[[21](#cit/section_4.21),[22](#cit/section_4.22)]
- TGF-beta and IL-6 decreased.[[22](#cit/section_4.22)]
- [Reduction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=654999&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in nitric oxide.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)]

However, another study found no [statistically significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44167&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) difference between comparison groups when accounting for the observed biomarker, PGE2.[[23](#cit/section_4.23)] Additionally, a different study found no significant change in GPx.[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]

Another study conducted using a proprietary lecithin delivery system of a curcumin-containing product (500 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) tablet) given 3 times/day found that curcumin-containing product supplementation consistently improved oxidative status in patients who received [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[24](#cit/section_4.24)]

#### Curcumin-containing products alone

Two studies have been published that suggest a possible [antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effect of curcumin-containing products.

Published results (possible antitumor effect of curcumin-containing product):

1. One report described a patient with treatment-resistant [myeloma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45795&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who began a daily oral regime of a curcumin-containing product. A single 8,000 mg dose of the curcumin-containing product (containing curcuminoids complexed with bioperine to aid with [absorption](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463702&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) was taken on an empty [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) each evening. The patient also underwent [hyperbaric oxygen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45218&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment.[[25](#cit/section_4.25)]

- Over the course of 60 months, the patient’s cancer remained stable with minor fluctuations in paraprotein levels.
2. An [open-label](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285990&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [phase II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45831&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) trial investigated the efficacy and [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445093&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcumin-containing products alone in patients with advanced [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[26](#cit/section_4.26)] The study enrolled 25 patients who received 8,000 mg (orally) of a curcuminoid-containing product daily until [disease progression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45669&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); each 1 g [capsule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) contained 900 mg of curcumin, 80 mg of demethoxycurcumin, and 20 mg of bisdemethoxycurcumin. Of the 25 patients, 21 were evaluable for response and 24 for toxicity.

- No treatment-related toxicity was reported.
- One patient had [stable disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45884&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for more than18 months and another patient had a brief tumor [regression.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46039&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)

#### Imatinib and curcumin-containing products

[Imatinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44893&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and curcumin-containing products have been studied in patients with [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [adenoid cystic carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ACC).

Published results (treatment of [c-kit](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44329&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)–positive metastatic ACC with imatinib and a curcumin-containing product):

1. A published [case report](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) described the successful treatment of a patient with a c-kit–positive metastatic ACC using imatinib and a curcumin-containing product. Imatinib was administered orally at 400 mg/day along with 225 mg/m2 of a curcumin-containing product in 1,000 mL of normal [saline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46152&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [intravenously](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (IV) over 2 to 3 hours, twice a week. An oral curcumin-containing product was also administered, two capsules twice daily (42 mg curcumin per capsule). This [regimen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45864&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was continued for 6 months.[[27](#cit/section_4.27)]

- Stable disease was observed after 2 months of treatment, and a significant reduction in tumor [mass](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=638197&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (80% decrease in [tumor volume](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467873&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) was observed at 6 months.
- After cessation of IV treatment at 6 months, but with steady use of an oral curcumin-containing product and imatinib, the patient showed continuous clinical and radiographic improvements.

Given the known activity of imatinib against c-kit–positive tumors, the contribution of curcumin-containing products to the efficacy of this patient’s treatment regimen is unclear.

#### Docetaxel and curcumin-containing products

Two studies have explored the efficacy, tolerability, and feasibility of [docetaxel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45382&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plus curcumin-containing products in the treatment of cancer.[[28](#cit/section_4.28),[29](#cit/section_4.29)]

Published results (efficacy of docetaxel and a curcumin-containing product):

1. A 2010 study conducted in France examined docetaxel plus curcumin-containing products in patients with advanced and metastatic [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[28](#cit/section_4.28)] Six dose levels of oral curcumin-containing products were studied. Doses varied from 500 mg to 8,000 mg daily along with docetaxel (100 mg/m2) administered as a 1-hour IV infusion on day 1 of each 3-week cycle for six cycles. Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study, and ten patients completed the treatments of docetaxel plus a curcumin-containing product. [Diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and headaches were the main [dose-limiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44170&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) toxicities, and three patients considered the amount of the curcumin-containing product (16 capsules a day) as unacceptable. A curcumin-containing product dose of 6,000 mg/day for 7 consecutive days every 3 weeks was determined to be the recommended dose for further investigation in combination with a standard dose of docetaxel.[[28](#cit/section_4.28)]

- Among the [evaluable patients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44029&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) enrolled on the study, no disease progression was observed with the combination treatment.
- One patient had evaluable bone lesions that were stable after six cycles of treatment.
- Five patients had partial responses, and three patients had stable disease.
- A [biological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44510&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) response was documented with a decrease of [tumor markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46636&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in seven patients.
2. A randomized phase II study compared docetaxel and curcumin with docetaxel and placebo in patients with metastatic [castration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45636&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-resistant [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[29](#cit/section_4.29)] Patients received 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel on day 1 every 3 weeks for six cycles and 5 mg of [prednisone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45492&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [prednisolone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46155&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) twice a day. Patients also received either 6 g of curcumin or placebo daily (4 capsules, 500 mg each, 3 times per day: morning, lunchtime, and evening) for 7 consecutive days every 3 weeks.

- There were no differences in [progression-free survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44782&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PFS), [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) response rate, [overall survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=655245&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (OS), or quality of life between the groups.

A multicenter, phase II, randomized, [double-blind study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45673&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was initiated at the same institution in France and compared docetaxel plus a curcumin-containing product with docetaxel plus [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The study was terminated for futility in view of results from the interim analysis ([NCT02095717](/clinicaltrials/NCT02095717)).

#### Gemcitabine and curcumin-containing products

Three studies investigated the efficacy and safety of variable formulations and doses of curcumin-containing products in combination with gemcitabine. All studies administered gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 of 4 weeks, but differed in rate of gemcitabine [administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Two research studies of first-line treatment in patients with advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC) showed differing results in tolerability and toxicity profiles.

Published results (gemcitabine and a curcumin-containing product):

1. A research group from Israel enrolled 17 patients in an open-label, phase II trial.[[30](#cit/section_4.30)] Patients received 8,000 mg of a curcumin-containing product by mouth daily concurrently with chemotherapy.

- Five patients discontinued the curcumin component of the combined treatment mostly because of [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) toxicity, and 11 evaluable patients received the planned concurrent treatment of the two [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) until progression of disease (median, 2.5 months); one patient died at home from causes unrelated to the study.
- Seven patients reported gastrointestinal toxicity, mostly diarrhea.
- Of the 11 evaluable patients, 1 had a partial response, 4 had stable disease, and 6 had tumor progression.
- [Median overall survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=655248&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was 5 months.

The authors concluded that this combination of curcumin-containing products and gemcitabine is not feasible in this population of patients.
2. Conversely, an Italian study (N = 44) reported good tolerability using 2,000 mg daily of a curcumin-containing product.[[31](#cit/section_4.31)]

- A partial response was observed in 27.3% of patients and stable disease was observed in 34.1% of patients; the overall disease control rate was 61.4%.
- The median OS was 10.2 months and median [time to progression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44783&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was 8.4 months, which is reported to be higher than the historically observed OS rates of 5.7 to 6.7 months for gemcitabine as a single agent.
- The researchers also noted that patients using this combination of a curcumin-containing product and gemcitabine reported lower-than-expected hematological toxicity. Grade 3 to grade 4 diarrhea occurred in only one patient.
3. A clinical trial of patients with gemcitabine-resistant PC also found this combination to be safe and effective (N = 21). In addition to gemcitabine, this study administered 60 mg/m2 of S-1 orally for 14 consecutive days every 3 weeks.[[32](#cit/section_4.32)] Patients received a mixture of curcuminoids (8,000 mg/day) that they took at their own convenience, while on a standard chemotherapy [treatment schedule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346524&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); the [compliance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446112&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rate was 90%.

- No patients experienced a partial or [complete response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Five patients demonstrated stable disease.
- The most common adverse events of [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and diarrhea were attributed to chemotherapy or disease progression.

#### FOLFOX and curcumin-containing products

A group from the United Kingdom conducted a combined phase I [dose-escalation study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=802094&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and a phase IIA study of daily oral curcumin-containing products with [folinic acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613202&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fluorouracil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46090&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [oxaliplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45465&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([FOLFOX](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346521&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) (CUFOX) in patients with metastatic [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to assess safety, tolerability, and a suitable dose of curcumin.[[33](#cit/section_4.33),[34](#cit/section_4.34)] Both studies used the same curcumin-containing product.

Published results (FOLFOX and a curcumin-containing product):

1. In the phase I dose-escalation trial, oral doses of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, or 2,000 mg of curcumin-containing products were given daily with a loading period of 1 week before initiation of FOLFOX chemotherapy.[[33](#cit/section_4.33)]

- The curcumin-containing product was determined to be a safe and well-tolerated [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to FOLFOX at doses up to 2,000 mg/day.
- Of the 12 patients, 11 patients demonstrated stable disease or partial responses to the treatment after six cycles and 8 patients maintained these responses.
- Median PFS was 34 weeks.
- The adverse events (AEs) reported were primarily gastrointestinal, mainly diarrhea, which is consistent with those described with FOLFOX alone and in some curcumin-containing product trials.
2. In the phase IIA study, 28 patients were accrued, 18 of whom received CUFOX with or without [bevacizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46115&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), while 9 patients were randomly assigned to the control arm and received FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab. One patient was deemed ineligible and was excluded from analyses.[[34](#cit/section_4.34)]

- Grade 1 or grade 2 fatigue, [peripheral neuropathy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44705&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and diarrhea were the most reported AEs in both arms.
- Three patients who received CUFOX reported grade 3 or grade 4 thromboembolic events.
- No complete response was observed; however, 22% of patients who received FOLFOX exhibited stable disease and 44% of patients who received FOLFOX exhibited partial responses; 28% of patients who received CUFOX exhibited stable disease and 56% of patients who received CUFOX exhibited partial responses.
- The median PFS was 171 days for patients who received FOLFOX and 320 days for patients who received CUFOX.
- The median OS was 200 days for patients who received FOLFOX and 596 days for patients who received CUFOX.
- The difference in median OS rates between the two arms in this study was statistically significant. However, the small sample size and an imbalance between the two groups regarding the percentage of patients with two or more metastatic sites makes this result difficult to interpret.

### Quality-of-Life Studies

One study examined the potential effect of [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (QOL) of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients (N = 80) with [solid tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45301&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), predominantly [gastric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454513&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [colorectal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cancer.[[22](#cit/section_4.22)] All patients received [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for their respective cancers while enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either curcuminoids (180 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/day) or matched [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for 8 weeks. Curcuminoids were prepared with phosphatidylcholine to boost [bioavailability](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44225&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Meriva contains 20% curcuminoids; therefore, each patient was asked to take three 300 mg [capsules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) per day (one capsule tid).

This study reported an overall increase in self-reported QOL in both groups, with greater improvement in the curcuminoid group. However, because of the higher [baseline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) QOL values in the placebo group when compared with the curcuminoid group, it is difficult to interpret these results.

### Cancer Therapy Side Effects

#### Dermatitis

The effects of [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-containing products on [radiation-induced dermatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446545&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were investigated in three studies.[[36](#cit/section_4.36)-[38](#cit/section_4.38)] Two of the studies evaluated [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) curcumin-containing products while one study assessed [topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) application of a curcumin-containing cream.

Published results (curcumin-containing products in the treatment of radiation-induced dermatitis):

1. In a [randomized](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [double-blind](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45673&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) study, 30 adult women with [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who received [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) alone were randomly assigned to receive either [experimental](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44758&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment ([oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) curcumin-containing product; 2,000 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) or [control](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment ([placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) 3 times a day.[[36](#cit/section_4.36)]

- Self-reported pain measures showed no [significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390271&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) differences between the treatment arms. However, the severity of radiation dermatitis at the treatment site was reduced in patients who received the oral curcumin-containing product.
2. A multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the [efficacy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of an oral curcumin-containing product to reduce radiation dermatitis severity. Breast cancer patients (N = 686) were randomly assigned to received an oral curcumin-containing product (2,000 mg) or placebo 3 times a day.[[37](#cit/section_4.37)]

- While curcumin did not reduce radiation dermatitis severity, fewer curcumin-treated patients with a Radiation Dermatitis Severity scale score of >3.0 suggested a trend towards reduced severity; the [outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lacked statistical significance.
3. In a [prospective,](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44079&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [investigator](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44685&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-blinded study, 40 adult breast cancer patients underwent radiation therapy and received either a [turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-containing cream or baby oil (placebo) for 5 weeks. The skin was treated with 5 g of turmeric-containing cream or baby oil 5 times daily, before and after radiation therapy.[[38](#cit/section_4.38)]

- Results showed that curcumin was effective in reducing the severity of dermatitis at 2, 3, and 4 weeks, compared with placebo.

#### Mucositis

Several studies evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of a curcuminoid-containing product by oral application (mouthwash) in the treatment of oral [mucositis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[39](#cit/section_4.39),[40](#cit/section_4.40)] The studies used several objective outcome measures, including the [World Health Organization's](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454794&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) mucositis scale and Oral Mucositis [Assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) Scale.

Published results (curcuminoid-containing products in the treatment of oral mucositis):

1. A study of adult patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy aimed to assess the efficacy of turmeric powder with honey on treating oral mucositis. The [experimental group](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of patients (n = 30) were given a mixture of turmeric powder and honey to apply 5 minutes before treatment, maintain during treatment, and then reapplied 5 minutes after treatment. The control group of patients received no supplementation (n = 30).[[40](#cit/section_4.40)]

- Good tolerability and a reduction in oral mucositis were noted in patients using the turmeric and honey treatment.
- No adverse effects were observed.
2. In an investigator-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 80 patients with [head and neck cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) underwent combined [carboplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45182&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/radiation therapy and received turmeric (6 times a day) or povidone-[iodine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44548&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (twice a day) mouthwash every other day. Oral mucositis was assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system.[[41](#cit/section_4.41)]

- Turmeric mouthwash delayed and reduced the levels of radiation-induced oral mucositis at all time points.
- Patients who used the turmeric mouthwash had decreased intolerable mucositis, fewer treatment breaks during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and reduced weight loss.
3. In a double-blind randomized study, 32 adult patients with head and neck cancer received radiation therapy and either an oral nano-encapsulated curcumin-containing product (80 mg a day) or a placebo. Fifteen patients received the nano-encapsulated curcumin-containing product (study group), and 14 patients received the placebo (control group). Oral mucositis was assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.[[42](#cit/section_4.42)]

- In the study group of patients, onset of oral mucositis was delayed.
- Severity of mucositis increased in all patients, but the grade was significantly lower in patients receiving curcumin.
- While 50% of patients in the control group (7 of 14) developed grade 4 mucositis, no patients developed grade 4 mucositis in the study group.
- The study group had reduced weight loss, and no [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were detectable in this group.
4. In a randomized [single-blind study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44727&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), 61 adult patients with head and neck cancer who underwent radiation therapy received either an oral curcumin-containing product (500 mg [capsule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); total dose of 1.5 g a day) or a placebo 3 times a day. Patients were assessed weekly during radiation therapy and 2 months after treatment.[[43](#cit/section_4.43)]

- Beginning with week 3 of treatment, patients who received curcumin had decreased incidence and severity of oral mucositis. Two months after treatment, these patients experienced less severe oral mucositis.
- Results from the subjective assessment of patients were comparable to those obtained using the objective scale.
- No [systemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445093&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was observed.

#### Multiple effects

A proprietary lecithin delivery system of a curcuminoid-containing product given 3 times/day (500 mg tablet) was evaluated in a [controlled study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44015&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The study assessed efficacy in alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients undergoing these treatments 1 month after [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for their cancer (N = 160; 80 patients each in the chemotherapy group and the radiation therapy group). These groups were further divided into experimental and control groups, with 40 patients in each subgroup receiving Meriva or a comparable placebo tablet. In both the chemotherapy and radiation therapy groups, frequency and severity of reported symptoms were significantly lower in the Meriva group and no significant changes were reported in the control group.[[24](#cit/section_4.24)]

### Pediatric Population and Curcumin-Containing Products

#### Anticancer effects

A case report has been published that suggests a possible antitumor effect of a curcumin-containing product. The case report described a 6 month-old infant with infantile hemangioendothelioma. The curcuminoid-containing product was given at a dose of 400 mg/day over the course of 9 months.[[35](#cit/section_4.35)]

- Radiographic improvement was seen within 3 months.
- There was a notable decrease in liver size at 6 months, and an [ultrasound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46157&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) showed no [residual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45869&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) lesions within 1 year.
- The patient was well and thriving with no evidence of disease at the age of 6 years.

Given that this disease is known to frequently undergo spontaneous involution, the [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity of the curcumin-containing product in this case should be questioned. However, the authors indicated that this patient’s [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) had some signs of an adverse [prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Mucositis

One pediatric study evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of a curcuminoid-containing product by oral application (mouthwash) in the treatment of oral mucositis.[[39](#cit/section_4.39)] The study used several objective outcome measures, including the WHO's mucositis scale and Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale. Seven patients (four evaluable) used 10 drops of Curcumall in 50 mL of water along with standard oral care (0.2% chlorohexidine mouthwash for 30 seconds) 2 times a day during doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy treatment. Curcumall is a liquid formula mouthwash containing a tincture of curcumin C3 complex, turmeric, and ginger dissolved in glycerin and 0.4% of alcohol to create a serving dose. Compliance was inconsistent as follows:[[39](#cit/section_4.39)]

- Good tolerability and a reduction in oral mucositis were noted in patients using the curcumin/turmeric mouthwash.
- Except for one patient with gastrointestinal upset, no adverse effects were observed.

## Adverse Effects

Most [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of curcuma-containing products have demonstrated few, if any, associated [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In one small study (N = 17) of patients who received a [curcumin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46049&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-containing product along with [gemcitabine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508951&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), about 30% of patients (N = 5) who received 8,000 mg/day of the curcumin-containing product discontinued the product because of intractable [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) fullness. Two other patients had a [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reduction to 4,000 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), also because of abdominal complaints.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] In this study, seven patients had grade 3 [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445093&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and two patients had grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity.

## Summary of the Evidence for Curcumin (Curcuma, Turmeric)

To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the strength of the evidence (i.e., the [levels of evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a study must:

- Be published in a [peer-reviewed scientific journal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=537399&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Report on [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or outcomes, such as [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), improvement in survival, or measured improvement in [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Describe [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) findings in sufficient detail for a meaningful evaluation to be made.

Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis of CAM treatments for cancer, see [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).

## Latest Updates to This Summary (05/13/2025)

The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
new information becomes available. This section describes the latest
changes made to this summary as of the date above.

**[General Information and History](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/curcumin-pdq#_4)**

Added [text](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/curcumin-pdq#_302) to state several cases of severe liver toxicity have occurred in Europe and the United States after consumption of products that were labeled as containing curcumin (cited Lombardi et al. and Halegoua-DeMarzio et al. as references 2 and ,3 respectively). These toxic events may be the result of contamination with toxins known to be in some of these products and/or adulteration or individual patient susceptibility. Various organizations, including international government regulatory agencies, have released cautionary safety advisory notices regarding curcumin-containing products.
