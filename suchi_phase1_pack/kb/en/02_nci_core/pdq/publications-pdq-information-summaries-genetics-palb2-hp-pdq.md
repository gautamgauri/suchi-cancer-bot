# PALB2 and Associated Cancer Risks (PDQ®) - NCI

# PALB2: Cancer Risks and Management (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Genetics

The *PALB2* (Partner And Localizer of *BRCA2*) [gene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) is located on [chromosome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46470&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) 16p12.2. This gene interacts with both *BRCA2* and *BRCA1* to restore and maintain genomic stability via homologous recombination repair of [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) double-stranded breaks. Several studies have reported a high [penetrance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339344&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) of breast cancer in women who carry *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). *PALB2* is now included on all breast cancer [multigene panel tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763019&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). [Germline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460154&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) [biallelic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=775789&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) loss-of-function of *PALB2* variants (also known as *FANCN*) lead to Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia is a syndrome that is associated with early developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cancer [predisposition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=809370&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

## Prevalence of PALB2 Pathogenic Variants

Several studies have reported prevalence rates of *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). These studies included case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, and commercial lab databases. There is considerable heterogeneity among these studies in terms of study design, populations studied, strength of the [family history,](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) sequencing techniques, and levels of coverage. Most of these studies included individuals who were referred for clinical genetic testing, and they are, therefore, are not representative of the general population. Prevalence rates in these studies ranged from 0.3% to 1.2%.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)-[13](#cit/section_2.13)] A meta-analysis analyzed data from 48 studies of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer and were referred for genetic testing. This meta-analysis found that prevalence of *PALB2* pathogenic variants was 0.9%, and the odds ratio for breast cancer was 4.87.[[14](#cit/section_2.14)] Another study, which included only women with metastatic breast cancer, reported a *PALB2* prevalence of 1.8%.[[15](#cit/section_2.15)] A study from a genetic testing lab found a *PALB2* prevalence of 0.36% in Caucasian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)] Despite the variability in study design and study populations, prevalence rates for *PALB2* pathogenic variants were very similar.

*PALB2* [founder pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783962&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) have been described in Finnish, Polish, Canadian, Russian, Argentinian, Greek, Italian, Australian, and Hispanic populations.

## PALB2 Cancer Risks, Spectrum, and Characteristics

### Female Breast Cancer Risk Associated with *PALB2* Pathogenic Variants

The association between *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and female breast cancer was first reported in 2007.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] After the publication of several small studies, a 2014 report by the *PALB2* Interest Group (PALB2-IG) (from 14 international research centers, involving 154 families with loss-of-function *PALB2* pathogenic variants) confirmed that the risk range for female breast cancer in *PALB2* overlapped with that of *BRCA2*.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Analysis of 311 women from these 154 families found that by age 70, absolute risk of female breast cancer was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24%‒44%) for those without [family histories](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) of breast cancer and 58% (95% CI, 50%‒66%) for those with two or more [first-degree relatives](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460150&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (FDRs) with early-onset breast cancer. A cohort effect was also observed, in which breast cancer risk was significantly higher in women from more recent birth cohorts. Thirty percent of women with available hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses had [triple-negative breast cancers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=639916&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).

In 2019, this study was updated and expanded to include 8,830 women in 524 families from 44 study centers in 21 countries.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] Families included at least one member with a *PALB2* [pathogenic variant.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) Individuals with known *BRCA1/2* pathogenic variants were excluded. The absolute risk of breast cancer was 16.9% (95% CI, 13.3%‒21.3%) by age 50 years and 52.8% (95% CI, 43.7%‒62.7%) by age 80 years. Like in the earlier study, both family history and birth cohort were significantly related to risk.

To avoid bias of studying only women with increased breast cancer risk, researchers sequenced *PALB2* in 16,501 unselected *BRCA1/2*-negative breast cancer patients from 10 provinces in China.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] This study found a *PALB2* pathogenic [variant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) prevalence of 0.97%, which is similar to prevalence estimates reported in other studies. The overall odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer risk in women with *PALB2* pathogenic variants was 5.23 (95% CI, 2.84‒9.65). However, there was a significant association between breast cancer risk and age, with an OR of 10.09 (95% CI, 3.95‒25.70) for women age 30 years or younger and 5.06 (95% CI, 2.74‒9.43) for women older than 30 years. *PALB2* [carriers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460132&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) were more likely to have family histories of breast and/or ovarian cancer (20.63% vs.7.96% in noncarriers). These individuals were more likely to have larger tumors and positive axillary lymph nodes than controls. The Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) sequenced 34 suspected breast cancer susceptibility [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in 60,466 women with invasive breast cancer and 53,461 controls to refine estimates for breast cancer risk.[[5](#cit/section_3.5)] The OR for breast cancer risk in women with *PALB2* pathogenic variants was 5.02 (95% CI, 3.73‒6.76). The OR was higher for estrogen receptor (ER)‒negative breast cancer.

### Contralateral Breast Cancer Risk Associated with *PALB2* Pathogenic Variants

Data on contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk in *PALB2* carriers are limited. Although there are limited data, both the CARRIERS Consortium and the BCAC have published similar findings.[[6](#cit/section_3.6),[7](#cit/section_3.7)] The CARRIERS study included data from ten prospective studies of 15,104 women with [genotype](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=660739&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and [phenotype](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) data.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)] The overall hazard ratio (HR) for CBC in *PALB2* carriers was 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4‒6.4). CBC risk was seen primarily in women with ER-negative disease. The HR for CBC in *PALB2* carriers with ER-negative disease was 3.7 (95% CI, 1.5‒9.0). The 10-year cumulative risk of CBC was 7.9% overall and 19.7% in women with ER-negative breast cancer. CBC risk was significantly higher in African American women with ER-negative breast cancer, in whom the HR was 4.8 (95% CI, 1.4–16.8). CBC risk in this population was observed predominantly in women who were premenopausal when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. The BCAC report included 30,628 women from 34 studies.[[7](#cit/section_3.7)] The HR for CBC in women with *PALB2* pathogenic variants was 2.67 (95% CI, 1.35‒5.35). *PALB2* carriers had poorer survival when compared with noncarriers, but this association was not significant when it was adjusted to include tumor characteristics.

### Male Breast Cancer Risk Associated with *PALB2* Pathogenic Variants

Risk of male breast cancer in the general population is 0.1%. However, this cancer clusters in families with breast cancer cases. While there are few studies on pathogenic variants identified in men diagnosed with breast cancer, several reports have detected *PALB2* pathogenic variants in this population. Data on 708 men with breast cancer who underwent testing at one genetic testing lab found an OR of 6.6 (95% CI, 1.7‒21.1) for breast cancer in men with a *PALB2* pathogenic variant, although the number of individuals with *PALB2* pathogenic variants in this study was small.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] A large case-control study from Italy that included 767 *BRCA1/2*-negative men with breast cancer found an OR of 7.28 (95% CI, 1.17‒45.42) for male breast cancer in men with *PALB2* pathogenic variants.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)] Like in [sporadic male breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339347&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), most tumors in men with non-*BRCA1/2* pathogenic variants were invasive ductal carcinomas that were ER-positive, progesterone receptor‒positive, and HER2-negative. Similarly, the PALB2-IG study of 524 families with *PALB2* pathogenic variants reported a relative risk (RR) of 7.34 (95% CI, 1.28‒42.19) for male breast cancer.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] Despite small numbers, estimates of male breast cancer risk associated with *PALB2* are consistent across studies. *PALB2* is emerging as the second-most commonly mutated gene in male breast cancer, after *BRCA2*.

### Pancreatic Cancer Risk Associated with *PALB2* Pathogenic Variants

A study first reported a *PALB2* pathogenic variant in an individual with [familial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460148&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) pancreatic cancer in 2009 using exome sequencing.[[10](#cit/section_3.10)] In subsequent studies of individuals with exocrine pancreatic cancer, *PALB2* pathogenic variants were found in 2% to 4% of participants.[[11](#cit/section_3.11),[12](#cit/section_3.12)] In the PALB2-IG study (with 524 *PALB2* families), the RR was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.24‒4.50) for pancreatic cancer when *PALB2* pathogenic variants were present.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] In individuals with *PALB2* pathogenic variants, the absolute lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is estimated to be between 5% and 10%.

### Ovarian Cancer Risk Associated with *PALB2* Pathogenic Variants

Although data on the association between *PALB2* pathogenic variants and ovarian cancer are mixed, there is growing acknowledgement that ovarian cancer risk may be moderately increased in *PALB2* carriers. Ovarian cancer risk is further increased in women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer at young ages and in those with family histories of breast/ovarian cancers.

A University of Washington study ascertained the frequency of *PALB2* pathogenic variants in patients with ovarian cancer.[[13](#cit/section_3.13)] Patients were unselected for age/family history and were enrolled through a university biobank and two Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) clinical trials for advanced ovarian cancer. The OR for ovarian cancer was 10.2 (95% CI, 2.2‒47.0). A similar study on the frequency of pathogenic variants from [multigene panel testing](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=763019&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) in a series of clinically ascertained ovarian cancer cases (participants were referred to one genetic testing lab) found a standardized risk ratio of 3.08 (95% CI, 1.93‒4.67) for *PALB2*.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)] The authors speculated that this association was driven by a strong association between *PALB2* and breast cancer risk, since participants were 3.5-times more likely to have personal or family histories of breast cancer when compared with reference controls. Similar data from a different genetic testing lab reported an OR of 1.60 for ovarian cancer (95% CI, 0.98‒2.60), which did not meet statistical significance.[[15](#cit/section_3.15)] Researchers sequenced the coding regions of 54 candidate genes in 6,385 women with invasive ovarian cancer and 6,115 controls with broad European ancestry from 19 studies (mostly case-control studies).[[16](#cit/section_3.16)] This study found that *PALB2* pathogenic variants were associated with a moderate risk of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.45‒4.64; *P* = .0013). The cumulative absolute risk of ovarian cancer in *PALB2* carriers by age 80 years was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.8%‒5.7%). Similarly, the PALB2-IG study found an estimated RR of 2.91 (95% CI, 1.40‒6.04) for ovarian cancer in *PALB2* carriers and an absolute lifetime ovarian cancer risk of approximately 5%.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] The aforementioned meta-analysis of 48 studies found an OR of 2.13 for ovarian cancer.[[17](#cit/section_3.17)]

### Other Cancer Risks Associated with *PALB2* Pathogenic Variants

*PALB2* pathogenic variants have been described in colorectal, gastric, prostate, and other cancers.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] However, *PALB2*'s contribution to risk in these cancer types has not yet been confirmed. For more information about research on *PALB2* and gastric cancer risk, see the [Other Genes Associated With Gastric Cancer](/types/stomach/hp/gastric-genetics-pdq#_3805) section in Genetics of Gastric Cancer.

## Cancer Surveillance and Risk Management in PALB2 Carriers

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends breast cancer [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) with annual mammogram and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast starting at age 30 years in women with *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] Given the increased contralateral breast cancer risk seen in premenopausal women with *PALB2* pathogenic variants, MRI screening can also be conducted following a primary breast cancer. However, MRI screening may be of little benefit after age 65 years in this population. Risk-reducing mastectomy can be considered, based on the individual’s [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). In men with *PALB2* pathogenic variants, breast cancer screening with annual mammogram may be considered starting at age 50 years or 10 years earlier than the youngest breast cancer diagnosis in the family. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy may be considered for women starting at age 45 to 50 years. Because family history can impact ovarian cancer risk in *PALB2* [carriers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460132&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), individualized [risk assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460214&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) is encouraged.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] Protocols for pancreatic cancer screening vary but mainly include contrast-enhanced MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound starting at age 50 years or 10 years before the earliest pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the family.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] Historically, professional organizations have recommended pancreatic cancer screening only when a family history of pancreatic cancer is present. However, recommendations conflict across professional organizations when a family history of pancreatic cancer is absent. Ongoing discussions with health care providers is encouraged, given the evolving data.

## Prognosis in PALB2 Carriers

### Breast Cancer Prognosis in *PALB2* Carriers

A prospective cohort study of 12,529 women with invasive breast cancer in Poland first reported an excess of [triple-negative breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=639916&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (TNBC) in *PALB2* [carriers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460132&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) when compared with noncarriers.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] In this study, the hazard ratio (HR) for death associated with *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) was 2.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.59‒3.02). However, this HR pertained to women with tumors larger than 2 cm. In a study of 16,501 unselected *BRCA1/2*-negative breast cancer patients from China, *PALB2* carriers were significantly more likely to have TNBCs than noncarriers (22.83% vs. 13.56%, respectively).[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] *PALB2* carriers had larger tumors, more positive axillary lymph nodes, and more contralateral breast cancers. Other studies reported that *PALB2* carriers had TNBC rates ranging from 30% to 40%.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] A large population-based study in China observed a significantly shorter overall survival in *PALB2* carriers with breast cancer than in noncarriers.[[4](#cit/section_5.4)]

## Cancer Treatment in PALB2 Carriers

Because *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) are relatively rare, data on treatment are scarce. However, *PALB2* interacts with *BRCA1/2* to maintain the integrity of the homologous recombination pathway. Therefore, tumors that lack *PALB2* activity may respond similarly to drugs that are effective in *BRCA1*/*2*-mutated tumors. A number of studies have reported that solid tumors with *PALB2* pathogenic variants had increased [sensitivity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322883&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) to platinum agents.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] Several phase II trials have suggested that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors may exhibit activity in patients with *PALB2* pathogenic variants. Although some data show that tumors with *PALB2* pathogenic variants have high tumor mutational burdens and tumor neoantigen burdens, data on the activity of immunosuppressive therapies are lacking. Several studies are examining the efficacy of using PARP inhibitors with other agents in *PALB2*-mutated breast tumors, ovarian tumors, and other solid tumors.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)]

## PALB2 Summary

Although rare, *PALB2* [pathogenic variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) significantly increase the risk of breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. *PALB2* pathogenic variant prevalence rates in published studies range from 0.3% to 1.8% and have been found in countries across the globe. Rates of breast cancer in individuals with *PALB2* pathogenic variants are similar to those associated with *BRCA2*. However, individuals with *PALB2* and *BRCA2* pathogenic variants have higher rates of [triple-negative breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=639916&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic). *PALB2* pathogenic variants are also associated with increased risks of contralateral breast cancer and male breast cancer.

*PALB2* [carriers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460132&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) have significantly increased risk to develop pancreatic cancer. Although there are conflicting data about *PALB2*’s role in ovarian cancer, there is also growing evidence that *PALB2* pathogenic variants confer moderately increased ovarian cancer risk.

[Surveillance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=496506&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) and risk management recommendations are mainly based on data from *BRCA* trials. There is increased interest and activity in clinical trials to include individuals who carry *PALB2* pathogenic [variants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776887&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic).
