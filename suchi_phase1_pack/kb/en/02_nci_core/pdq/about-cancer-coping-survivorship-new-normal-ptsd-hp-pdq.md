# Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Overview

[Go to Patient Version](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal/ptsd-pdq)

Stress- or
trauma-related symptoms such as avoidant behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and
heightened arousal are often seen in survivors of cancer.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)-[4](#cit/section_1.4)] These symptoms
resemble those seen in individuals who have experienced traumatic events
such as:[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

- Military combat.
- Violent personal assault (e.g., rape).
- Natural disasters.
- Other threats to life.

These symptoms experienced by cancer survivors fall under the “Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders” category in the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, fifth edition (DSM-5). The category includes acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

Reviews note that post-traumatic stress (PTS) has been studied in a variety of cancers, including melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and mixed cancers.[[6](#cit/section_1.6)]

Most of the studies to date have used the criteria of the DSM, fourth edition (DSM-IV) because they were conducted before publication of the DSM-5. This summary will primarily refer to studies conducted using the DSM-IV criteria.

Studies have varied in the assessment of patients for the full syndrome of PTSD (i.e., all DSM criteria met) or only some of the PTSD-related symptoms (e.g., intrusive thoughts as measured by the Impact of Event Scale). As a result, incidence rates have varied.

Risk factors for patients with cancer developing PTS and PTSD have not been extensively studied. However, one study of women with early-stage breast cancer found an association with PTSD-like symptoms in patients with the following characteristics:[[7](#cit/section_1.7)]

- Younger age.
- Lower income.
- Fewer years of formal education.

Another study of men and women treated with bone marrow transplant found that lower levels of social support and the use of avoidance coping correlated significantly to a higher number of PTSD-like symptoms.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)] One German study that evaluated patients with breast cancer for PTSD and acute stress disorder (ASD) concluded that patients with lifetime PTSD (8.7%) were much more likely to experience cancer-related ASD or PTSD (odds ratio, 14.1).[[9](#cit/section_1.9)]

Although no specific therapies for PTS symptoms in the cancer setting have been developed, treatment modalities used with other people with PTSD can be useful in alleviating distress in cancer patients and survivors.

In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed. The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults. When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.

## Prevalence

Reviews of the literature [[1](#cit/section_2.1)] note that post-traumatic stress (PTS) has been studied in a variety of cancers, including melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and mixed cancers.

The incidence of the full syndrome of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (meeting all *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* [DSM] diagnostic criteria) ranges from 3% to 4% in patients recently diagnosed with early-stage disease to 35% in patients evaluated after treatment. When the incidence of PTSD-like symptoms (not meeting the full DSM diagnostic criteria) is measured, rates are higher, ranging from 20% in patients with early-stage cancer to 80% in those with recurrent cancer.

The earliest research on PTS among cancer survivors concentrated on the prevalence and characteristics of the disorder in patients
who had undergone or were undergoing treatment, adult and child cancer survivors, and/or their
family members. A wide variety of cancer types
was studied, including leukemia,[[2](#cit/section_2.2)] breast cancer,
and head and neck cancers.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)] Much of this early research, which predates DSM-IV, dealt with survivors of Hodgkin disease, probably because diagnoses at an early age and higher rates of survival resulted in a larger population available for study.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] These survivors had a particularly high prevalence of intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors, even though they were many years posttreatment.[[5](#cit/section_2.5)-[7](#cit/section_2.7)] Most of these studies investigated PTSD-like symptoms, rather than the complete mental disorder with all diagnostic criteria.

The first study of cancer patients using the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria looked at 27 patients (most with breast cancer), all at least 3 years postdiagnosis and no longer receiving any cancer treatments. Prevalence rates of 4% for current PTSD and 22% for lifetime prevalence were found.[[8](#cit/section_2.8)] Those who met the criteria for lifetime prevalence were
noted to have higher levels of general psychological distress, suggesting that
individuals with a history of PTSD are at a substantial risk of continued
emotional difficulties.

Studies using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) [[9](#cit/section_2.9)] found prevalence rates for PTSD between 3% and 10% in adult patients with cancer. Most of these studies looked at women with early-stage breast cancer, who were evaluated a few months to a few years after their cancer treatments. Similarly, in a prospective study of 115 patients with all stages of breast cancer being treated at a comprehensive cancer center, 4% met the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD; 41% met the subsyndromal criteria for PTSD (experiencing intense fear, helplessness, or horror after being diagnosed with cancer). This set of subsyndromal criteria was a weak predictor of PTSD (12%) but a useful predictor of major depressive disorder, global anxiety disorder, and past major depressive disorder, and it may better serve as a marker for elevated distress.[[10](#cit/section_2.10)]

In a few studies of patients who underwent bone marrow transplants, slightly higher prevalence rates of PTSD have been reported, ranging from 5% [[11](#cit/section_2.11)] to 12% to 19% [[12](#cit/section_2.12)] to as high as 35%.[[13](#cit/section_2.13)] The range appears to be influenced by time of assessment (higher rates occur with more time since transplant) and the assessment method used. Studies reporting lower rates typically used a self-report questionnaire,[[14](#cit/section_2.14)] whereas those reporting higher rates [[13](#cit/section_2.13)] used the SCID and evaluated for symptoms at multiple time points since diagnosis (i.e., lifetime prevalence). The changes to the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) included removal of the subjective response of “intense fear, horror, or helplessness” that had been added to Criterion A in the DSM-IV.[[15](#cit/section_2.15)]

To illustrate the distinction between these tools, a German study evaluated patients with breast cancer (n = 127) for PTSD immediately postsurgery and 6 months after the first assessment.[[16](#cit/section_2.16)] The assessments included screening instruments for acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD, such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C). The first assessment also included a semistructured interview using the SCID. Based on the SCID, 2.4% of participants met the criteria for mild-to-moderate cancer-related PTSD, and 2.4% were diagnosed with ASD. However, the IES-R and PCL-C screening instruments identified PTSD in 18.5% of participants at the first assessment and in 11.2% to 16.3% of participants at the second assessment. Authors of the study suggested that unlike the SCID, the IES-R and PCL-C screening instruments measured diffuse emotional distress and adjustment problems and not precise PTSD symptoms.

One of the main differences between symptom-based measures such as the PCL-C and an actual SCID-based diagnosis is the dysfunction caused by the symptoms. The symptoms are rather common, but only a small percentage of people who have the symptoms are disabled by them.

## Risk Factors, Protective Factors, and Hypothesized Mechanisms

A variety of sociodemographic, disease-related, psychosocial, and psychological variables have been investigated to determine their relationship to post-traumatic stress (PTS) related to cancer. So far, there is no clear picture of which patients are at increased risk of developing PTS after a diagnosis of or treatment for cancer.

### Sociodemographic Variables

Few patient characteristics have been shown to predict the occurrence of PTS.
High levels of psychological distress have been correlated with both stress
symptoms [[1](#cit/section_3.1)-[3](#cit/section_3.3)] and a diagnosis of full-syndrome post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult survivors.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] In
addition, trait anxiety was found to predict post-traumatic symptoms in the
parents of survivors of childhood cancer.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] Women who are survivors of
cancer and have a diagnosis of lifetime PTSD tend to have a history of
exposure to trauma.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[5](#cit/section_3.5)] Demographic characteristics such as age, sex,
and education level at time of diagnosis have not been reliable predictors of stress
symptoms.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[6](#cit/section_3.6),[7](#cit/section_3.7)]

### Disease-Related Variables

Disease-related variables that have been associated with a higher incidence of PTSD in patients who underwent bone marrow transplant include more advanced disease and a longer hospital stay.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] Other studies, however, have found no association between time since diagnosis and treatment, severity of disease, or type of cancer treatment.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[9](#cit/section_3.9),[10](#cit/section_3.10)] The relationship between disease stage and post-traumatic symptoms has not been adequately studied. Most studies have not found an association; however, they typically included a limited range of disease stages or studied only early-stage cancer.[[11](#cit/section_3.11)]

The time since diagnosis and treatment has been shown to correlate with and
predict post-traumatic symptoms in survivors of osteogenic sarcoma [[2](#cit/section_3.2)] and
Hodgkin lymphoma.[[7](#cit/section_3.7),[12](#cit/section_3.12)] Specifically, people who were further from
diagnosis and treatment tended to exhibit fewer symptoms. This effect, however,
has not been found in studies of patients with recent recurrences,[[13](#cit/section_3.13)]
survivors of breast cancer,[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] or survivors of childhood cancers.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)] Duration of
treatment, rather than time since treatment, has been shown to predict stress
symptoms in survivors of childhood cancer.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)]

The presence of pain and other physical symptoms has been shown to correlate with levels of intrusive thoughts.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Cancer recurrence has also been shown to increase the likelihood of stress symptoms in patients.[[13](#cit/section_3.13)]

### Psychosocial and Psychological Variables

The experience of past traumatic events appears to be an important psychosocial risk factor associated with PTS symptoms,[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[15](#cit/section_3.15),[16](#cit/section_3.16)] as was found in both patients with early-stage [[17](#cit/section_3.17)] and those with metastatic breast cancer.[[18](#cit/section_3.18)] Previous trauma in combination with recent stressful life events was significantly related to PTS symptoms.[[19](#cit/section_3.19)]

Other psychosocial risk factors, such as premorbid psychopathology,[[20](#cit/section_3.20),[21](#cit/section_3.21)] high levels of general psychological distress,[[22](#cit/section_3.22)] and dysfunctional coping and attributional styles, [[15](#cit/section_3.15),[23](#cit/section_3.23),[24](#cit/section_3.24)] have been linked to a risk of PTSD in war veterans, Holocaust survivors, and other disaster victims. In addition, several investigators have linked predisposing genetic factors [[25](#cit/section_3.25),[26](#cit/section_3.26)] and other biological factors (e.g., overly reactive hormonal systems and reduced hippocampal volume) to risk of PTSD.[[27](#cit/section_3.27)-[29](#cit/section_3.29)] Among social factors, the quality of the recovery environment, often measured in terms of social support, has been shown to affect risk of PTSD after exposure to combat [[20](#cit/section_3.20)] and burn injury.[[30](#cit/section_3.30)] The effect of threats to life and body integrity has been documented in samples of adults and families [[1](#cit/section_3.1),[4](#cit/section_3.4),[12](#cit/section_3.12)] but not children.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)]

Psychological variables that have been related to a higher incidence of PTSD include:

- A history (precancer diagnosis) of PTSD.[[5](#cit/section_3.5),[31](#cit/section_3.31)]
- Increased use of avoidance coping.[[32](#cit/section_3.32)]
- Lower levels of social support.[[32](#cit/section_3.32)]

### Protective Factors

Greater perceived availability of social support is associated with fewer stress-response symptoms in patients with early-stage breast cancer [[17](#cit/section_3.17),[19](#cit/section_3.19)] and in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplant.[[32](#cit/section_3.32)]

The availability and timeliness of accurate health-related information may also offer protection from stress-response symptoms. Women who met the diagnostic criteria for acute stress disorder reported significantly less satisfaction with the communication of their cancer diagnosis.[[33](#cit/section_3.33)] Similarly, women who were unaware of their cancer stage reported higher stress-response symptoms than those who knew more about the stage of their disease.[[34](#cit/section_3.34)] To the extent that adequacy of information reflects the quality of a patient’s relationship with medical staff, another protective factor may be the quality of those relationships. Difficult patient-staff relationships have been reported to predict stress-response symptoms in women with cancer.[[35](#cit/section_3.35)]

### Hypothesized Mechanisms

PTSD is precipitated by an intensely
distressing event; however, this factor alone is not sufficient to explain the
disorder. Not everyone exposed to a traumatic stressor develops the full-blown
syndrome (or subsets of symptoms) or qualifies for the diagnosis. Attempts to
explain these differences and to predict who is vulnerable have focused on
the following types of factors:

- Psychological (i.e., learning theory).
- Biological (especially hormonal).
- Social
(i.e., social support).

Early studies of Vietnam War veterans
suggested a two-factor learning theory to account for trauma-related
pathology.[[36](#cit/section_3.36),[37](#cit/section_3.37)] The same theory has also been applied to
the development of PTSD in patients with cancer.[[38](#cit/section_3.38)-[40](#cit/section_3.40)]

PTSD symptoms develop as a function
of both classical conditioning and instrumental learning. Classical conditioning accounts
for the fear responses elicited by various stimuli that are
associated with the original traumatic event. Neutral stimuli (e.g., smells, sounds,
and visual images) previously paired with the aversive stimuli (e.g.,
chemotherapy or painful procedures) eventually evoke anxiety, arousal, and fear
when presented alone, even after the trauma has ended. Higher-order
conditioning and stimulus generalization account for the exacerbation and
extension of symptoms to additional stimuli. Once established, PTSD symptoms
are maintained through instrumental learning, that is, avoidant responses are
reinforced because avoidance of the stimuli prevents unpleasant feelings and
thoughts.

Estimates from epidemiological studies suggest that on average,
25% to 33% of individuals who are exposed to traumatic events, including cancer,
develop PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD.[[27](#cit/section_3.27),[41](#cit/section_3.41)] Although the disorder appears to be a result of learning
processes, many factors have been suggested to explain why one person
develops PTSD and another does not.

## Assessment of Post-Traumatic Stress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the Cancer Setting

### Diagnostic Criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)

The diagnostic criteria for PTSD and ASD changed considerably in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5). Changes from the fourth edition to the DSM-5 included the following:[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]

- Elimination of the subjective component to the definition of trauma.
- Tightening of the definitions of trauma and exposure to it.
- Expansion and rearrangement of symptom criteria.
- Changes in additional criteria and specifiers.

Criterion A, which is necessary for PTSD and ASD diagnoses, specifically states, “A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events.” Thus, for the experience of cancer to meet Criterion A, it must entail acute and extreme adverse events in the context of cancer and/or cancer treatments. Events such as the cancer diagnosis, side effects of cancer treatments, and distress, worries, or negative thoughts about prognosis do not automatically qualify as trauma. Furthermore, patients with cancer can only be diagnosed with ASD or PTSD if they experience specific trauma-related symptoms, many of which are focused on or related to re-experiencing symptoms and intrusive memories. Fear of recurrence or worries about prognosis do not qualify as PTSD or ASD symptoms.

The four core clusters of symptoms for a PTSD diagnosis are as follows:

- Re-experiencing of trauma symptoms, e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive memories (at least one out of five).
- Avoidance symptoms, e.g., avoidance of distressing cancer memories (at least one out of two).
- Numbing/dissociative and/or negative cognitive symptoms, e.g., unrealistic guilt or self-blame (at least two out of seven).
- Arousal and reactivity symptoms, e.g., reckless/destructive behaviors and unprovoked angry outbursts (at least two out of six).

These symptoms must last for at least 1 month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

### Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) and PTSD in the Cancer Setting

A timely, careful assessment of patients with cancer is critical to identify symptoms of cancer-related PTS, to note the deleterious
impact of the symptoms on functioning, and to plan interventions targeted at the most
distressing symptoms.
It is also critical that the assessment distinguish between the full DSM PTSD syndrome (meets all required diagnostic criteria) and PTS-related symptoms only.

The most difficult aspect of PTS assessment in the cancer setting is the
determination of precisely when to evaluate the patient. Diagnosis is complicated because
cancer is not an acute or discrete event, but an experience marked by repeated
trauma and indeterminate length. An individual may exhibit the symptoms
of PTS at any point from diagnosis through treatment, to treatment completion
and, possibly, to recurrence.[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] Patients such as Holocaust survivors, whose history of victimization
can cause PTSD or its symptoms, can have symptoms activated by any number of stimuli
encountered during their treatment (e.g., clinical procedures such as being
inside magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanners). While
such patients may have more difficulty adjusting to cancer and cancer
treatment, their symptomatology is likely to vary greatly according to their circumstances. The relative predominance of specific PTS symptoms
may wax and wane throughout the cancer experience and beyond.[[3](#cit/section_4.3)]

The definition in the DSM-5 indicates that although PTSD symptoms usually begin within 3 months after trauma, there may be a delay of 4 or more months or even years
before symptoms appear.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] These findings support the necessity for long-term monitoring of cancer survivors and their family members.

At least one study found that individuals who have experienced a traumatic
event may exhibit early symptoms without meeting the full criteria for a
diagnosis of PTSD.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] Nonetheless, the appearance of these early symptoms was
found to predict later development of full PTSD syndrome. These results lend
further credence to the need for both repeated and long-term follow-up of
individuals exposed to the trauma of cancer.
For more information, see [Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq).

The difficulty of properly diagnosing PTS may be compounded by the
overlapping of PTS symptoms with those of other psychiatric disorders and by
the time-related aspects of normal adjustment. For example, irritability, poor
concentration, hypervigilance, excessive fear, and disturbed sleep are also
symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Other arousal and avoidance symptoms
are common to PTSD, phobias, and panic disorder, but loss of interest, sense of
a foreshortened future, avoidance of other people, and sleep impairment might
suggest both PTSD and depressive disorders. Even normal reactions to the
diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening disease can consist of responses
such as:

- Intrusive thoughts.
- Disassociation and depersonalization.
- Sleep
disturbances.
- Heightened arousal.

Clinicians and researchers
must be particularly attuned to the causes, duration, and severity of PTSD-like
symptoms when considering PTSD among several diagnoses.
For instance, in a study of women with breast cancer, 41% reported experiencing “intense fear, helplessness, or horror”; however, on further comprehensive diagnostic interview, only 4% met the full PTSD criteria. Assessment must be able to distinguish between general psychological distress and symptoms of PTSD.[[5](#cit/section_4.5)]

The accurate diagnosis of PTSD also requires the use of reliable and valid
instruments. Many studies have used the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R–Nonpatient Edition.[[6](#cit/section_4.6)] This instrument is a clinician-administered, structured clinical interview that is time intensive and may not be feasible in settings without adequately trained mental health professionals. However, one study [[7](#cit/section_4.7)] investigated the utility of a cost-effective screening tool, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).[[8](#cit/section_4.8)] In this study of 82 women diagnosed with breast cancer assessed 6 to 72 months after cancer treatment, use of the PCL-C resulted in a sensitivity of 0.60 and specificity of 0.99. Other cutoff scores for the PCL-C that could be used were discussed, depending on the clinical resources available in specific cancer treatment settings.
Most research studies have used the Impact of Event Scale, a self-report of intrusive thoughts;[[9](#cit/section_4.9)] however, it is important to note that this tool can help evaluate PTS symptoms but is not designed to assess PTSD.

### Comorbidity

In attempting to diagnose PTSD, it is important to be aware that this disorder
is often marked by comorbid psychopathology. Substance abuse, affective
disorders, and other anxiety disorders are consistently encountered in samples
of people with PTSD.[[3](#cit/section_4.3),[10](#cit/section_4.10)-[12](#cit/section_4.12)] For example, in one study, war veterans with PTSD
exhibited substantial comorbid pathology that included:[[13](#cit/section_4.13)]

- Major depression (32% to 72%).
- Alcohol dependence (65%).
- Drug dependence (40%).
- Social phobia (50%).
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (10%).

High rates of concurrent disorders
have also been documented in other trauma victims. For example, 40% to 42% of
disaster survivors with PTSD also qualified for a diagnosis of major depression,
and 20% to 42% met the criteria for concurrent generalized anxiety
disorder.[[13](#cit/section_4.13),[14](#cit/section_4.14)] While co-occurring psychiatric disorders have not yet been studied in cancer patients or
survivors, their presence in Vietnam
War veterans and other trauma victims would indicate that cancer clinicians
should be alert to identify and treat such related syndromes in
their patients.

### The Conceptual Fit of PTS and Cancer

Conceptual and practical problems can arise in the application of PTS to cancer patients and survivors. The basic concept of an extreme traumatic stressor has been described variously as an event involving direct personal experience that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury.[[15](#cit/section_4.15)] This event can be protracted and continuous but is more frequently a single, time-limited event (e.g., rape, natural disaster). In this context, for the person who has been diagnosed with cancer, the exact nature of the trauma is unclear. Is it the actual diagnosis, aspects of the treatment process, information given about recurrence, test results, or some other aspect of the cancer experience? Identifying a discrete stressor within the multiple crises that constitute a cancer experience is more difficult than for other traumas. In one study of patients with breast cancer who underwent autologous bone marrow transplant, more PTSD-like symptoms were reported at the time of initial diagnosis.[[16](#cit/section_4.16)]

Another concern regarding conceptual fit is related to re-experiencing the trauma. In a study of women with early-stage breast cancer, researchers found that the traumatizing aspects of the cancer experience were receiving the diagnosis and waiting for test results from node dissection.[[17](#cit/section_4.17)] Arguing that these “information traumas” tend to cause intrusive worry about the future—not intrusive recollections of past events—the authors questioned whether cancer fits a conceptual model of PTSD trauma. Re-experiencing the trauma is often measured in terms of unwanted intrusive thoughts about the traumatic event. The cognitive processing of a current and ongoing health threat with uncertain outcome might differ significantly from unwanted intrusive thoughts about a single past event. Some researchers have argued that not all intrusive thoughts are negative or indicate re-experiencing a trauma; rather, they might represent appropriate vigilance and attention to potential symptoms that could result in appropriate help-seeking.[[5](#cit/section_4.5),[18](#cit/section_4.18)]

Conversely, a unique study assessing the physiological reactivity of patients with breast cancer to a personalized imagery script of their most stressful experiences with cancer found elevated physiological responses that were comparable to those of PTSD patients who had experienced other (non–cancer-related) traumas. This finding suggests a good fit between patients with cancer and the PTSD trauma model, as it shows comparable symptoms of increased arousal in patients with cancer. Also, in a factor analytic study designed to confirm the presence of the three broad PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance of reminders, and hyperarousal), researchers found some tentative support for the DSM-IV symptom clusters in a sample of breast cancer survivors.[[19](#cit/section_4.19)]

In a study of 74 women breast cancer survivors interviewed at 18 months postdiagnosis via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, three groups were identified: one met the full criteria for PTSD (n = 12), another met partial criteria for PTSD (i.e., subsyndromal, n = 15), and a third group had no PTSD (n = 47). Further analyses investigated group differences. Some notable factors affecting the full-criteria PTSD group compared with the subsyndromal and no-PTSD groups included the following:[[20](#cit/section_4.20)]

- Significantly higher number of violent traumas (e.g., physical abuse, rape).
- Higher number of anxiety disorders preceding a cancer diagnosis.
- More advanced disease (75% stage III vs. 7% in the subsyndromal group and 6% in the no-PTSD group).
- More extensive surgeries (83% modified radical mastectomy vs. 47% in the subsyndromal group and 38% in the no-PTSD group).
- Higher lifetime prevalence of previous PTSD (42% vs. 7% in the subsyndromal group and 9% in the no-PTSD group).

Further research is needed to continue to investigate the important question of how well the conceptual model of PTSD as an anxiety response to a major life trauma fits the life experience of patients with cancer. Reviews have argued both in favor of [[21](#cit/section_4.21)] and against [[18](#cit/section_4.18)] the continued use of trauma models for conceptualizing the experience of cancer. Others have proposed alternate conceptual models.[[5](#cit/section_4.5),[22](#cit/section_4.22)]

## Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

The chronic and sometimes devastating psychological and interpersonal sequelae of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) necessitates timely and effective
treatment.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2)] The avoidant responses associated
with PTSD often delay or prevent individuals from seeking professional
assistance. While no specific therapies for PTSD in the
cancer setting have been developed, treatment modalities used with other people with PTSD can help alleviate distress in cancer patients and survivors.[[3](#cit/section_5.3),[4](#cit/section_5.4)]

Most
clinicians recommend using a multimodal approach, choosing components
to meet the specific needs of each patient and taking into account any
concurrent psychiatric disorders such as depression or substance abuse. Multiple modalities are frequently considered in a
crisis intervention approach to facilitating adjustment of patients with cancer.

The crisis intervention model comprises a broad range of therapies that can help treat post-traumatic stress symptoms. The goals of this model are to reduce
symptoms and restore patients to their usual levels of functioning. In this
model, the therapist often takes an active, directive stance with the patient,
focusing on the following: [[5](#cit/section_5.5)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Resolving concrete problems.
- Teaching specific coping skills.
- Providing a safe and supportive environment.

Cognitive-behavioral techniques have proven especially helpful within the
crisis intervention setting. Some of these methods include the following:[[6](#cit/section_5.6)]

- Helping the patient
understand symptoms.
- Teaching effective coping strategies and stress
management techniques (such as relaxation training).
- Restructuring cognition.
- Providing exposure to opportunities for systematic desensitization of
symptoms.

In a single case study, a 10-session cognitive-behavioral intervention for a male cancer patient who was 3 years post–bone marrow transplant and had PTSD was found to be effective. This study used a combination of cognitive coping strategies, relaxation procedures, relapse prevention, and generalization techniques. Benefits were maintained at a 6-month follow-up.[[7](#cit/section_5.7)][[Level of evidence: III](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663087&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Behaviorally oriented approaches to sexual therapy may also be
useful when the avoidance manifested by patients is decreased
sexual activity and avoidance of intimate situations.

Support groups also appear to benefit people who experience post-traumatic symptoms. In the group setting, such patients can receive emotional
support and encounter others with similar experiences and symptoms, validating their own experiences and learning a variety of coping and management strategies.

For patients with particularly distressing or severe symptoms,
psychopharmacology may provide an additional means of treatment. Several
classes of medications have been used to treat individuals with
PTSD.[[8](#cit/section_5.8),[9](#cit/section_5.9)] For pharmacological treatments for PTSD, see [Table 1](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal/ptsd-hp-pdq#_138). For example:

- Tricyclic and monoamine oxidase-inhibitor antidepressants
are commonly used, particularly when the symptoms of PTSD are accompanied by
depression.
- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are effective
in reducing the hyperarousal and intrusive symptoms of PTSD.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]
- Antianxiety
medications may help reduce overall arousal and anxiety symptoms.
Infrequently, antipsychotic medications may reduce severe intrusive flashbacks.

## Considerations for Pediatric Patients and Their Families

Cancer is often a significant traumatic event, given the nature of the diagnosis, the number of invasive and painful procedures, and the often-long hospitalizations that children and their families must endure. Based on of this exposure model, a number of studies have examined whether children treated for cancer are at a significantly higher risk for developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with mixed results.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] One study reported that children and adolescents who were undergoing treatment reported some symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS). However, for most children, these symptoms did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, and the symptoms diminished over time.[[2](#cit/section_6.2)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Other studies suggest that survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk for PTS symptoms and PTSD after treatment is finished. In a study of 78 adults aged 18 to 41 years who had been treated for childhood cancer, 20.5% met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at some time since the end of their treatment. Clinically significant events of intrusive symptoms (9%) and avoidant symptoms (16.7%) were reported in the sample, and the symptoms were associated with reports of elevated anxiety and other measures of psychological distress.[[3](#cit/section_6.3)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)] Survivors who report higher levels of uncertainty about their disease and the future appear more likely to have reports of elevated PTS symptoms.[[4](#cit/section_6.4)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)][[5](#cit/section_6.5)]

Similarly, a study of 182 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors who were more than 5 years from diagnosis and more than 2 years from completion of cancer treatment found that 16% met the criteria for PTSD. A relationship between PTSD and higher levels of other psychological problems was also reported.[[6](#cit/section_6.6)] When survivors met the criteria for PTSD, they were more likely to experience depression and negative affect, lower satisfaction with life, and poorer health-related quality of life, as well as difficulty performing developmental tasks.[[7](#cit/section_6.7)][[Level of evidence: II](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=663072&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the diagnostic criteria for and treatment of cancer-related post-traumatic stress and related symptoms. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

The lead reviewers for Cancer-Related Post-Traumatic Stress are:

- Natalie Jacobowski, MD (Nationwide Children's Hospital)
- Jayesh Kamath, MD, PhD (University of Connecticut Health Center)
- Rachel A. Pozzar, PhD, RN (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute)

Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's [Email Us](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/email-us"). Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.

### Levels of Evidence

Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board uses a [formal evidence ranking system](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/supportive-care) in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
