## General Information About Anal Cancer

[Go to Patient Version](/types/anal/patient/anal-treatment-pdq)

### Incidence and Mortality

Estimated new cases and deaths from anal, anal canal, and anorectal cancer in the United States in 2025:[[1](#cit/section_1.1)]

- New cases: 10,930.
- Deaths: 2,030.

### Prognosis and Survival

The two major prognostic factors for anal cancer are tumor size and nodal status. Primary tumors smaller than 2 cm have a better prognosis.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] Nodal drainage of the anus follows the inguinal vein. The initial evaluation of a patient with anal cancer will include a careful clinical examination of the inguinal region and biopsy of any palpable lymph nodes. For more information, see the [American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_138) section.

Anal cancer is usually curable. At presentation, most patients have T1 or T2 disease (≤5 cm), and fewer than 20% of patients have node-positive disease. The 5-year survival rate for these early-stage patients exceeds 85%.[[3](#cit/section_1.3),[4](#cit/section_1.4)] Even in patients with node-positive disease, 5-year survival rates exceed 50% in the absence of invasion into adjacent organs or distant metastases.[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

### Risk Factors

Overall, the risk of anal cancer is rising due to increased incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.[[6](#cit/section_1.6),[7](#cit/section_1.7)] Ninety-five percent of anal cancers are HPV related, with the highest risk for serotypes 16 and 18. Involvement of HPV can be pathologically correlated with P16+ staining.[[8](#cit/section_1.8)]
Patients with HIV have a higher risk of HPV coinfection, and consequently have a higher risk of anal cancer.

Data suggest that
certain sexual practices, such as receptive anal intercourse or a high lifetime number of sexual partners, portend an increased risk of anal cancer. These practices may have led to an increase in the number of individuals at risk of infection with HPV.[[6](#cit/section_1.6)]

## Cellular Classification of Anal Cancer

Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinomas make up most primary
anal cancers. Historically, a subset of tumors arising from the epithelial transitional zone were categorized as cloacogenic or basaloid tumors. However, these tumors are now recognized as nonkeratinizing squamous cell cancers and are similarly associated with human papillomavirus.[[1](#cit/section_2.1),[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

Lesions in the hair-bearing skin distal to the squamous mucocutaneous junction are defined as perianal cancers. These are typically treated the same as anal canal cancers, although local therapy alone can be considered for discrete skin lesions with significant separation from the anal verge.

Adenocarcinomas starting in anal glands or fistulae formation are rare and generally have clinical features that are similar to rectal adenocarcinoma. For more information, see the [Clinical Features](/types/colorectal/hp/rectal-treatment-pdq#_279) section in Rectal Cancer Treatment.

Treatment of anal melanoma is not included in this summary.

## Stage Information for Anal Cancer

The anal canal extends from the rectum to the perianal skin and is lined by a
mucous membrane that covers the internal sphincter. Tumors of the anal margin (below the anal verge and involving the perianal
hair-bearing skin) are classified with skin tumors.

### American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions

The following is a staging
system for anal canal cancer that has been described by the AJCC and the International Union Against Cancer.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] The AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define anal cancer.

### Capecitabine and Fluorouracil Dosing

The *DPYD* gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in *DPYD*, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)] Patients with the *DPYD\*2A* variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other *DPYD* variants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)-[3](#cit/section_4.3)] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient's *DPYD* genotype and number of functioning *DPYD* alleles.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)-[6](#cit/section_4.6)] *DPYD* genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[[7](#cit/section_4.7)] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[[8](#cit/section_4.8)]

## Treatment of Stage 0 Anal Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stage 0 Anal Cancer

Stage 0 anal cancer is carcinoma *in situ*. Rarely diagnosed, it is a very early
cancer that has not spread below the limiting membrane of the first layer of
anal tissue.

Treatment options for [stage 0 anal cancer](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_330) include:

1. Surgical resection is used to treat lesions of the perianal area not
involving the anal sphincter. The surgical approach depends on the location of the lesion in
the anal canal.

### Current Clinical Trials

Use our [advanced clinical trial search](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/advanced") to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. [General information](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials") about clinical trials is also available.

## Treatment of Stages I, II, and III Anal Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stages I, II, and III Anal Cancer

Current sphincter-sparing therapies include wide local excision for small
tumors of the perianal skin or anal margin, or definitive chemoradiation therapy
(fluorouracil [5-FU] and mitomycin) for cancers of the anal canal. Radical resection is reserved for patients with
incomplete responses or recurrent disease.

Continued surveillance
with rectal examination every 3 months for the first 2 years and
endoscopy with biopsy when indicated after completion of sphincter-preserving
therapy is important to monitor for recurrence.

Treatment options for [stage I](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_331), [stage II](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_333), and [stage III anal cancer](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_332) include:

1. Small tumors of the perianal skin or anal margin not involving the anal
sphincter may be adequately treated with local resection.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]
2. The standard of care for all other stage I, II, and III anal cancers in appropriate patients is [chemoradiation therapy](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_396) (external-beam radiation therapy [EBRT] with chemotherapy).

- 5-FU + mitomycin + radiation therapy.[[2](#cit/section_6.2),[3](#cit/section_6.3)]
- Capecitabine + mitomycin + radiation therapy.[[4](#cit/section_6.4),[5](#cit/section_6.5)]
- 5-FU + cisplatin + radiation therapy.[[6](#cit/section_6.6),[7](#cit/section_6.7)]
3. Alternative strategies such as radiation therapy alone or surgery alone may be considered, depending on the clinical context.
4. Radical resection is reserved for residual or recurrent cancer in the anal
canal after nonoperative therapy.

#### Chemoradiation therapy

Because of historically high rates of recurrence with colostomy alone, chemoradiation therapy is the preferred approach for patients with anal cancer in the absence of distant metastases.

Evidence (chemoradiation therapy):

1. The Anal Cancer Trial (ACT I) from the United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research demonstrated the superiority of chemoradiation with 5-FU and mitomycin over radiation therapy alone with regard to local failure and deaths from anal cancer.[[2](#cit/section_6.2),[8](#cit/section_6.8)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

In this prospective trial, 585 patients were randomly assigned to receive 45 Gy of radiation in 20 or 25 fractions with or without 5-FU. The 5-FU was given by continuous infusion (750 mg/m2 for 5 days or 1,000 mg/m2 for 4 days) during the first and final weeks of radiation therapy, along with a single dose of mitomycin (12 mg/m2) on the first day.

- After a median follow-up of 13.1 years, patients who received chemoradiation therapy had a reduction in local failure (36% vs. 59%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35−0.60; *P* < .001), risk of death from anal cancer (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49−0.76; *P* < .001), and relapse at 12 years (17.7% vs. 29.7%; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 9.58−0.84; *P* < .001).[[2](#cit/section_6.2)][[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) in this trial (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.70−1.04; *P* = .12).
- An initial 9.1% increase in non–anal cancer deaths was observed in the first 5 years after chemoradiation therapy but was not seen at 10 years.
2. A European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial prospectively randomly assigned 100 patients with T3 to T4 or N1 to N3 disease to receive 45 Gy of radiation with a 15-Gy or 30-Gy boost with or without 5-FU infusion (750 mg/m2 for 5 days starting on days 1 and 29) plus mitomycin (15 mg/m2 on day 1).[[3](#cit/section_6.3)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

- Outcomes favored chemoradiation therapy with respect to 5-year colostomy-free survival rates (75% vs. 48%; *P* = .002) and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates (60% vs. 48%; *P* = .05).

Subsequent trials have found capecitabine to be a reasonable replacement for 5-FU in combination with mitomycin and radiation therapy.[[4](#cit/section_6.4),[5](#cit/section_6.5)]

While the ACT I and EORTC randomized trials established chemoradiation therapy as the preferred approach for nonmetastatic anal cancer, the substantial hematological, renal, and pulmonary toxicity of mitomycin has prompted studies of alternative regimens.

Evidence (chemoradiation therapy [**alternative regimens**]):

1. A Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial of 310 patients studied chemoradiation therapy (5-FU infusion + 45 Gy of radiation) with or without mitomycin.

- After 4-years of follow-up, patients who received mitomycin had an improved colostomy-free survival rate (71% vs. 59%; *P* = .014) and disease-free survival (DFS) rate (73% vs. 51%; *P* = .0003).[[9](#cit/section_6.9)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Two large intergroup trials studied the substitution of cisplatin for mitomycin, with differing conclusions.
2. In a phase III U.S. Intergroup trial ([RTOG 9811](/clinicaltrials/NCT00003596) [NCT00003596]), patients in the cisplatin arm received two cycles of induction 5-FU and cisplatin before receiving concurrent chemoradiation therapy with 5-FU and cisplatin.[[6](#cit/section_6.6)]

- Patients who received mitomycin had improved local control and an improved colostomy-free survival rate (90% vs. 81%; *P* = .02). Subsequent long-term follow-up demonstrated a borderline significant difference in the 5-year colostomy-free survival rate (71.9% vs. 65%; *P* = .05).[[10](#cit/section_6.10)]
- Long-term follow-up also demonstrated a superior 5-year DFS rate (67.8% vs. 57.8%; *P* = .006) and OS rate (78.3% vs. 70.7%; *P* = .074) for patients who received mitomycin.[[11](#cit/section_6.11)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- One potential explanation for the inferiority of cisplatin in this study was the delay in time to radiation therapy during induction chemotherapy.
3. In the prospective randomized ACT II trial, 940 patients were assigned in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive the following: (1) either mitomycin or cisplatin during induction chemoradiation therapy and (2) either maintenance therapy with 5-FU and cisplatin in weeks 11 and 14 or no maintenance therapy.[[7](#cit/section_6.7)]

- The complete remission rate was equivalent in patients who received mitomycin or cisplatin after a median follow-up of 5.1 years (90.5% vs. 89.6%; 95% CI, -4.9 to 3.1; *P* = .64). The 3-year PFS rate was also equivalent in both study groups (73% for mitomycin vs. 72% for cisplatin; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75−1.19; *P* = .063).[[7](#cit/section_6.7)][[Level of evidence B1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810025&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- There was also no significant effect on 3-year PFS rates among patients who received maintenance therapy or no maintenance therapy (74% vs. 73%; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75−1.21; *P* = .70).
- This study suggests that cisplatin might reasonably substitute for mitomycin in a chemoradiation strategy.

The best time to assess a complete clinical response after chemoradiation therapy is generally after 26 weeks because delayed responses are seen.[[12](#cit/section_6.12)] Residual disease or subsequent local recurrence require further treatment.

The standard salvage therapy for patients with either gross or microscopic residual disease after chemoradiation therapy has been abdominoperineal resection. Alternatively, patients may be treated with additional salvage chemoradiation therapy, chemotherapy alone, or immunotherapy.[[12](#cit/section_6.12),[13](#cit/section_6.13)]

The optimal radiation dose in various situations has not been determined. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the dose should be escalated for patients with T3 to T4 disease or nodal metastases, or potentially de-escalated for patients with early-stage tumors smaller than 1 cm. It is also unclear whether the chemotherapy backbone can be safely omitted for some patients with early-stage tumors, and whether such a strategy would affect the optimal dose of radiation. The roles for newer strategies such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton beam therapy, and brachytherapy have yet to be conclusively determined.[[14](#cit/section_6.14)-[16](#cit/section_6.16)] Based on the National Cancer Database, higher volume radiation oncology centers report improved OS for patients with anal cancer.[[17](#cit/section_6.17)]

## Treatment of Stage IV Anal Cancer

### Treatment Options for Stage IV Anal Cancer

Treatment options for [stage IV anal cancer](/types/anal/hp/anal-treatment-pdq#_337) include:

1. Palliative surgery.
2. Palliative radiation therapy.
3. Palliative chemotherapy (with or without radiation therapy).

- Cisplatin + infusional fluorouracil (5-FU).[[1](#cit/section_7.1)]
- Carboplatin + weekly paclitaxel.[[2](#cit/section_7.2)]
- Docetaxel + cisplatin + 5-FU.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)]
- Nivolumab.[[4](#cit/section_7.4)]
- Pembrolizumab.[[5](#cit/section_7.5)]
4. Checkpoint inhibitors.

#### Advanced-stage therapy

1. In the multicenter, randomized, phase II International Advanced Anal Cancer [InterAACT](/clinicaltrials/NCT02560298) trial (NCT02560298), carboplatin (area under the curve 5) and weekly paclitaxel was compared with standard infusional 5-FU and bolus cisplatin in patients with advanced-stage anal cancer.[[2](#cit/section_7.2)]

- With a median follow-up of 25.3 months, the median overall survival (OS) with carboplatin and paclitaxel was improved compared with cisplatin and 5-FU (20 months vs. 12.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; *P* = .014).[[Level of evidence A1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810017&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
- Serious adverse events were more common in patients treated with cisplatin plus 5-FU (62% vs. 36%; *P* = .016).

These promising findings have led international investigators to use carboplatin and paclitaxel as a new backbone in trials for patients with advanced-stage disease, as well as a potential partner for use with radiation therapy. Other chemotherapy regimens, such as modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU, are under clinical evaluation.[[3](#cit/section_7.3)]
2. The checkpoint inhibitors have also shown activity for patients with metastatic disease. The phase II [NCI96773](/clinicaltrials/NCT02314169) trial (NCT02314169) of single-agent nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) enrolled 37 patients.[[4](#cit/section_7.4)]

- The overall response rate was 24%, including two complete responses.[[4](#cit/section_7.4)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]
3. The phase Ib [KEYNOTE-028](/clinicaltrials/NCT02054806) trial (NCT02054806) for patients with advanced tumors with programmed death ligand-1 of at least 1% enrolled a cohort of 24 patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma.[[5](#cit/section_7.5)]

- The overall response rate was 17%, and an additional stable disease rate was 42%.[[5](#cit/section_7.5)][[Level of evidence C3](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=810039&version=HealthProfessional&language=English)]

Although there is no clear standard of care for patients with metastatic disease, recent studies are uncovering promising new avenues for systemic treatment.
Palliation of symptoms from the primary lesion is important. Patients with stage IV disease should strongly consider enrolling in clinical trials.

## Treatment of HIV and Anal Cancer

The tolerance of patients with HIV and anal
carcinoma to standard fluorouracil and mitomycin chemoradiation therapy is not well
defined.[[1](#cit/section_8.1),[2](#cit/section_8.2)] In general, patients with HIV are treated similarly to other patients and have similar outcomes, particularly in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Patients with pretreatment CD4 counts of fewer than 200 cells/μl may
have increased acute and late toxic effects.[[3](#cit/section_8.3),[4](#cit/section_8.4)]
Therefore, patients with a history of AIDS-related complications may have difficulty tolerating a standard regimen, necessitating a dose adjustment or omission of mitomycin.

## Treatment of Recurrent Anal Cancer

Local recurrences and persistent disease after treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy or
surgery as the primary treatment may be controlled by using the alternate
treatment (surgical resection after radiation and vice versa).[[1](#cit/section_9.1)] Salvage chemoradiation therapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin plus a radiation boost may avoid permanent colostomy in patients with residual tumor after initial nonoperative therapy.[[2](#cit/section_9.2)] Clinical
trials are exploring the use of radiation therapy with chemotherapy and
radiosensitizers to improve local control.

Preliminary studies in patients with stage IV disease suggest that alternative chemotherapy regimens (such as carboplatin and paclitaxel in the [InterACCT](/clinicaltrials/NCT02560298) trial [NCT02560298]) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (as in [NCI9673](/clinicaltrials/NCT02314169) [NCT02314169] and [KEYNOTE-028](/clinicaltrials/NCT02054806) [NCT02054806]) may be beneficial in this setting.

### Purpose of This Summary

It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
