## Childhood Laryngeal Cancer

### Incidence

Tumors of the larynx are rare. In children, the most common benign vascular laryngeal tumor is subglottic hemangioma.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] Malignant
laryngeal tumors, which are especially rare, may be associated with benign tumors such as polyps and
papillomas.[[2](#cit/section_1.2),[3](#cit/section_1.3)]

### Clinical Presentation

Laryngeal tumors may present with the following:

- Hoarseness.
- Difficulty swallowing.
- Stridor.
- Enlargement of the lymph nodes of the neck.

### Histology

A review of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data from 1973 to 2016 identified 23 pediatric patients with laryngeal malignancies. Sixteen of the patients had squamous cell carcinoma. The other identified histologies included small cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, myxosarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)]

### Treatment of Childhood Laryngeal Cancer

Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx in children is managed by surgery and radiation therapy, as in adults with
carcinoma at this site.[[4](#cit/section_1.4),[5](#cit/section_1.5)] Laser surgery may be the
initial treatment used for these lesions. Outcomes of pediatric patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx are similar to those reported for adult patients.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)] For more information about the treatment of laryngeal cancer in adults, see [Laryngeal Cancer Treatment](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq).

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Ophthalmologists.
- Rehabilitation
specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)] At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families. Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)-[5](#cit/section_2.5)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[[6](#cit/section_2.6)] The U.S. [Rare Diseases Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf "https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf") defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.

The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[[7](#cit/section_2.7),[8](#cit/section_2.8)] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:

- A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[[9](#cit/section_2.9)]
- The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[[10](#cit/section_2.10)] These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)]

Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as [Laryngeal Cancer Treatment](/types/head-and-neck/hp/adult/laryngeal-treatment-pdq).

## Childhood Laryngeal Papillomatosis

### Incidence

Respiratory papillomatosis is the most common benign laryngeal tumor in children and is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, most commonly HPV-6 and HPV-11.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] The presence of HPV-11 appears to correlate with a more aggressive clinical course than the presence of HPV-6.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)] An Australian survey of pediatric otorhinolaryngologists documented a decline in the incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis after the introduction of HPV vaccinations for adolescent girls and young women aged 12 to 26 years.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)] In another study of laryngeal papillomatosis in patients younger than 18 years, the incidence decreased from 165 cases in children born between 2004 and 2005 to 36 cases in children born between 2012 and 2013. The HPV vaccine was released in 2006. The authors attributed the decline to the widespread use of the vaccine.[[5](#cit/section_3.5)]

### Clinical Presentation

Laryngeal papillomatosis can cause
hoarseness because of the formation of wart-like nodules on the vocal
cords, which may rarely extend into the lung, producing significant morbidity.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)] Malignant
degeneration may occur, with development of laryngeal carcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer, generally reported at rates of 2% to 10% in the pediatric population.[[7](#cit/section_3.7)]

### Risk Factors

Exposure to HPV during a vaginal birth appears to be a risk factor for the development of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. A multi-institutional registry study identified children with juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis from 23 states between 2015 and 2020.[[8](#cit/section_3.8)] Of those children, 88.8% were delivered vaginally. Among 190 mothers, the median age at the time of delivery was 22 years. Of 114 mothers (60.0%) who were age-eligible to receive the HPV vaccine, 16 (14.0%) were vaccinated, 1 (0.9%) of whom was vaccinated before delivery. Of 162 tested biopsy specimens from children undergoing papillomatosis surgery, 157 (96.9%) had detectable HPV. All 157 specimens had a vaccine-preventable HPV type.

### Treatment of Childhood Laryngeal Papillomatosis

Primary treatment for papillomatosis is surgical ablation with laser vaporization.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)] Frequent recurrences are common. Lung involvement, although rare, can occur.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)]

Evidence (surgery):

1. A single-institution retrospective analysis evaluated 121 children with respiratory papillomatosis. The age at initial operation was 4.3 years (±2.9 years), and 47.9% of patients (58 of 121) experienced a recurrence and underwent surgical treatment after the age of 14 years.[[10](#cit/section_3.10)]

- At follow-up, 5% of the patients (6 of 121) had died, 41.3% of the patients (50 of 121) had been recurrence free for 5 years or longer (cured group), and 53.7% of the patients (65 of 121) experienced a recurrence in the previous 5 years (recurrent group).
- There were no significant differences in sex, age at initial operation, or adjuvant therapy between the cured and recurrent groups of patients.
- In the recurrent group, there was a higher incidence of overall operation frequency, aggressive disease, tracheal dissemination of the papilloma, and HPV infection.

If a patient requires more than four surgical procedures per year, other interventions may be necessary. The following therapies are under investigation:

- Systemic bevacizumab produced good results with minimal toxicity in a report of two patients with aggressive recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.[[11](#cit/section_3.11)] In another report of seven children treated with bevacizumab, continued responses were noted and subsequent surgical debridements were avoided in most patients. Of the seven patients, five did not require surgical debridement after the initiation of bevacizumab. Four of these five patients had previously required between four and ten debridements per year. Follow-up for these patients was between 8 months and 3.5 years. No serious adverse events were reported.[[12](#cit/section_3.12)] In a study of 24 patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, 15 had juvenile-onset disease. Patients were treated with systemic bevacizumab (7.5–10 mg/kg) every 3 to 4 weeks. All patients had a reduction in the number and size of lesions after three doses, excluding one patient who was lost to follow-up. Voice outcomes were improved in 87.5% of patients, as measured by Voice Handicap Index-30 (VHI) or pediatric VHI. No grade 3 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were reported. However, follow-up was limited to a maximum of 14 months after initiation of therapy and 10 months after discontinuation of bevacizumab.[[13](#cit/section_3.13)] In a study of 17 adult patients (12 with juvenile-onset recurrent or refractory respiratory papillomatosis) who received systemic bevacizumab, the number of recurrences and surgeries were significantly reduced compared with previous treatments.[[14](#cit/section_3.14)]
- Interferon therapy.[[15](#cit/section_3.15)]
- Immunotherapy with HspE7, a recombinant fusion protein that has shown activity in other HPV-related diseases. A pilot study suggested a marked increase in the amount of time between surgeries.[[16](#cit/section_3.16)]
- Laser therapy combined with intralesional bevacizumab.[[17](#cit/section_3.17)]
- Intralesional cidofovir has been studied. However, its effectiveness has not been conclusively demonstrated.[[18](#cit/section_3.18)]
- Checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 inhibitors, are currently being investigated.[[19](#cit/section_3.19)]
- Reports with small numbers of patients have documented that in selected cases, the administration of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine was associated with complete remission and an increase in the intersurgical interval.[[20](#cit/section_3.20),[21](#cit/section_3.21)] In contrast, other reports have not documented a therapeutic effect of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.[[22](#cit/section_3.22)]

## About This PDQ Summary

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of childhood laryngeal cancer and papillomatosis. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.

### Reviewers and Updates

This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the [PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment"), which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:

- be discussed at a meeting,
- be cited with text, or
- replace or update an existing article that is already cited.

Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.

The lead reviewers for Childhood Laryngeal Tumors Treatment are:

- Denise Adams, MD (Children's Hospital Boston)
- Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber of Boston Children's Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Harvard Medical School)
- William H. Meyer, MD
- Paul A. Meyers, MD (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center)
