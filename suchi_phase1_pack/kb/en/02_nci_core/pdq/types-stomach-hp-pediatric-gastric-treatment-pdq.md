## General Information About Pediatric Gastric Cancer

Primary gastric tumors in children are rare, and carcinoma of the stomach is even more unusual.[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] In one series, gastric cancer in children younger than 18 years accounted for 0.11% of all gastric cancer cases seen over an 18-year period.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)] In another study that used data from the National Cancer Database, patients younger than 21 years with gastric carcinoma were compared with patients older than 21 years.[[3](#cit/section_1.3)] Of the 129,024 cases identified, only 129 cases (0.1%) occurred in pediatric patients. While pediatric patients presented with more-advanced disease, overall survival for the two groups was similar. A retrospective analysis queried data from the Cerner Health Facts Database. The analysis identified 333 patients with gastric cancer (non-gastrointestinal stromal tumors, nonhematologic) from a base population of 9.6 million children.[[4](#cit/section_1.4)] The male-to-female ratio was 1.15 to 1. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.8 years. Gastric cancer was most prevalent in non-Hispanic White people and less common in Asian and Black people. Symptoms included abdominal pain, vomiting, anemia, diarrhea, and weight loss. Reflux symptoms with or without esophagitis, gastritis (including *Helicobacter pylori* gastritis), and duodenitis were reported in 10.2% of patients. Obesity, obesity-related comorbidities, tobacco use, and family history of colonic polyps, gastrointestinal cancer, and breast cancer were all more prevalent in this cohort of patients (*P* < .0001).

Prognosis depends on the extent of the disease at the time of diagnosis and the
success of treatment that is appropriate for the clinical situation.[[2](#cit/section_1.2)]

Rare cases of familial diffuse gastric cancer associated with *CDH1* germline pathogenic variants have been reported in adolescents.[[5](#cit/section_1.5)]

*H. pylori*
infections may increase the risk of gastric cancer.[[2](#cit/section_1.2),[6](#cit/section_1.6)] A Chinese study identified 1,015 pediatric patients with *H. pylori* infections who had endoscopic and histological data available to analyze.[[7](#cit/section_1.7)] The incidence rate of gastric mucosal precancerous lesions in children with *H. pylori* infections was 4.33% (37 of 854). There were 17 cases of atrophic gastritis, 11 cases of intestinal metaplasia, and 9 cases of dysplasia. For patients without *H. pylori*, there was only one case of atrophic gastritis (0.62%; 1 of 161 patients; *P* < .05).

## Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Evaluation

Gastric tumors must be distinguished from other conditions such
as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant carcinoid, leiomyosarcoma, and various
benign conditions or tumors of the stomach.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)] Symptoms of carcinoma of the stomach include the following:

- Vague upper
abdominal pain, which can be associated with poor appetite and weight loss.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Change in bowel habits.
- Poor appetite.
- Weakness.
- Anemia. Many individuals become anemic but otherwise show no symptoms before the
development of metastatic spread.

Fiberoptic endoscopy can be used to visualize the tumor or to
take a biopsy sample to confirm the diagnosis. Confirmation can
also involve imaging of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

## Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence. This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:

- Primary care physicians.
- Pediatric surgeons.
- Pathologists.
- Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
- Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
- Ophthalmologists.
- Rehabilitation
specialists.
- Pediatric oncology nurses.
- Social workers.
- Child-life professionals.
- Psychologists.
- Nutritionists.

For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on [Supportive and Palliative Care](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care").

The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[[2](#cit/section_3.2)] At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families. Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the [NCI website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials").

Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[[3](#cit/section_3.3)-[5](#cit/section_3.5)] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment. For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see [Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer](/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq).

Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[[6](#cit/section_3.6)] The U.S. [Rare Diseases Act of 2002](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf "https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ280/PLAW-107publ280.pdf") defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.

The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[[7](#cit/section_3.7),[8](#cit/section_3.8)] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:

- A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[[9](#cit/section_3.9)]
- The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[[10](#cit/section_3.10)] These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[[4](#cit/section_3.4)]

Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.

These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as [Gastric Cancer Treatment](/types/stomach/hp/stomach-treatment-pdq).

## Treatment of Pediatric Gastric Cancer

Treatment options for pediatric gastric carcinoma include the following:

1. Surgery.
2. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Treatment includes surgical excision with wide margins. For individuals
who cannot have a complete surgical resection, radiation therapy may be used
along with chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorouracil and irinotecan.[[1](#cit/section_4.1)]
Other agents that may be of value are the nitrosoureas with or without
cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, or mitomycin C.
