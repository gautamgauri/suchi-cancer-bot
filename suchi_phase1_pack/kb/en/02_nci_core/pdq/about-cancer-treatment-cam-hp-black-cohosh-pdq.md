[Go to Patient Version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/black-cohosh-pdq)

This [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) information summary provides an overview of the use of [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) as a treatment in [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients and [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), generally for the relief of [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The summary provides a brief history of black cohosh research, the results of laboratory and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and possible side effects of black cohosh use.

This summary contains the following key information:

- The roots and rhizomes of black cohosh are used for various medicinal purposes ranging from [gynecologic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45056&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to other [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Black cohosh was first used by American Indian or Alaska Native people. it is now commonly used in Europe.
- Black cohosh is frequently studied as a [complementary therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for breast cancer patients and survivors to reduce [vasomotor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256578&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) symptoms associated with treatment-induced [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Purported estrogenic actions of black cohosh are refuted by current, up-to-date laboratory and clinical studies of commercially available hydroalcoholic [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Suggestions of serotonergic activity are well supported.
- Recent findings show that black cohosh contains a large variety of constituents that are chemically related to [central nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46481&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)–active [molecules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which have not been studied in detail yet.
- Commercially available hydroalcoholic extracts of black cohosh have been well tolerated, with very rare serious [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported.
- [Observational](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286105&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [open-label](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285990&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) studies indicate benefits of black cohosh on climacteric symptoms in cancer and noncancer populations, though gold-standard clinical investigations fail to confirm this effect.
- Given both the evidence and variability of previous findings, including the lack of demonstration of a clinical benefit against [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and underexplored constituents, further [preclinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and clinical studies of black cohosh are warranted.

## General Information

Native to eastern and midwestern North America, [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (*Actaea racemosa*, also known as *Cimicifuga racemosa*) [[1](#cit/section_2.1)] is a member of the buttercup family (*Ranunculaceae*).[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3)] Black cohosh has many synonyms, including [black snakeroot](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321357&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bugbane](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321360&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), rattleroot, squawroot, and macrotrys or macrotys.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)-[4](#cit/section_2.4)] The roots and rhizomes of the black cohosh plant are used for medicinal preparations.

Various types of [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of black cohosh roots and rhizomes have been studied for their [chemical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) composition and [biological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44510&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity. [Lipophilic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373086&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) extracts have predominantly been used in [laboratory studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and only infrequently in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[3](#cit/section_2.3)] The most commonly used clinical preparations of black cohosh (e.g., Remifemin® and BNO 1055) are made from hydrophilic (typically hydroalcoholic) extracts.[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] Lipophilic extracts have *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* effects on [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-regulated [genes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45693&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic), whereas hydrophilic extracts generally do not.[[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

Several of the chemical constituents of black cohosh extracts have biological activities that have been demonstrated through *in vitro* studies and are candidate [markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for the observed *[in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* and clinical effects. Triterpene glycosides have structures similar to [steroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46601&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov),[[4](#cit/section_2.4)] but no apparent direct binding to the [estrogen receptor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46409&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[3](#cit/section_2.3)] One of the most abundant of such glycosides, 23-epi-26-deoxyactein, is specific for black cohosh and is the constituent usually chosen for standardization of commercial products.[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3)] At least 40 different triterpene glycoside analogues have been identified in black cohosh (*A. racemosa*), including actein and cimicifugoside congeners.[[2](#cit/section_2.2),[3](#cit/section_2.3)]

Other chemical constituents of black cohosh extracts include [aromatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642987&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) phenolpropanoids related to caffeic and ferulic acid, along with the black cohosh-specific fukinolic acid.[[5](#cit/section_2.5)] The plant also contains a large variety of guanidine [alkaloids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43994&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which have been explored chemically but not studied biologically.

Various plants that resemble black cohosh have been mistakenly or intentionally included in some commercial black cohosh products or plants. Such [adulteration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be detected by methods such as microscopy, high-performance thin-layer [chromatography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=655048&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet, and [DNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45671&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) barcoding.[[2](#cit/section_2.2)]

Black cohosh root, rhizome, and associated preparations have gained considerable international market and consumer interest for more than 60 years, particularly gaining U.S. interest within the last 15 years.[[6](#cit/section_2.6)] A market report released by the American Botanical Council stated that black cohosh extract was among the 15 top-selling [herbal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) by the food, [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and mass-market channel in the United States in 2019, with total sales nearing $30 million.[[7](#cit/section_2.7)] Growth in market demand for black cohosh has led to an increased need for scientific evidence of quality, safety, and [efficacy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[4](#cit/section_2.4),[5](#cit/section_2.5),[8](#cit/section_2.8)]

Companies distribute black cohosh as a dietary supplement. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may [adulterate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686042&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of black cohosh as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## History

[Black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was in use by American Indian or Alaska Native people when Europeans arrived in the New World.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)] Among the reported indications for black cohosh in traditional American Indian or Alaska Native [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were various female [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [rheumatism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44086&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (possibly due to malaria), general malaise, sore [throat](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439429&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), childbirth, and snakebite.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[2](#cit/section_3.2)] Early European settlers, and subsequently American eclectic [physicians](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390246&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), assimilated the use of black cohosh and began exporting the [herb](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to Europe as early as the 18th century.[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

Europeans have used black cohosh to treat [menopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for over 50 years. In Germany, the Commission E approved black cohosh as a treatment for dysmenorrhea, menopausal symptoms, heart palpitations, nervousness, irritability, sleep disturbances, [tinnitus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482287&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), vertigo, perspiration, and [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[1](#cit/section_3.1)]

Various sources suggested that the recommended [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of crude drug is 40 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) per day.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[3](#cit/section_3.3)] At least one trial compared two different doses (39 mg and 127.3 mg) [[4](#cit/section_3.4)] in women with menopausal symptoms and found equivalent beneficial effects at both doses. The lack of long-term safety studies has led some groups to recommend limiting the use of black cohosh to a maximum of 6 months.[[1](#cit/section_3.1),[5](#cit/section_3.5)]

## Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies

### Mechanism of Action

Given the apparent [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects of [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on [menopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), early preclinical investigations searched for an anticipated estrogenic activity. These [research studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) demonstrated differences between [lipophilic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373086&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which often had evidence of estrogenic activity,[[1](#cit/section_4.1)] and the hydroalcoholic extracts of the type contained in the most commonly used clinical products, which generally lacked such activity.[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[2](#cit/section_4.2)]

Considering the recent discovery of nitrogenous black cohosh constituents,[[2](#cit/section_4.2)] subsequent hypotheses for the activity of black cohosh involve potential effects on hypothalamic [neurotransmitter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) regulation systems,[[1](#cit/section_4.1),[3](#cit/section_4.3)] such as those involving
the [endogenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44026&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) central opioid system.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] This [hypothesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44209&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is supported by the observation that while black cohosh treatment alone has no effect on [luteinizing hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643019&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LH) activity, induction of [naloxone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45228&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) blockade of µ-opioid [receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44958&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [postmenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women treated with Remifemin® leads to the suppression of LH activity.[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] [Positron emission tomography](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46218&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [imaging](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46361&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in women treated with black cohosh indicated selective µ-opioid receptor availability, with increased availability in regions responsible for emotional and cognitive processing, and pronounced reductions observed in areas associated with the human [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[4](#cit/section_4.4)] Given such results, and the comparatively high frequency of placebo responsiveness in black cohosh [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), both pharmacologic and placebo effects simultaneously affecting the endogenous opioid system are suggested.

## Human/Clinical Studies

### Mechanism of Action, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics

Given that the clinically utilized hydrophilic [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) roots and rhizomes are not estrogenic, alternative mechanisms of [menopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptom](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) relief have been proposed, one of which suggests serotonergic activity by triterpenes to minimize episodes of [hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and bone loss.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)-[4](#cit/section_5.4)] While this finding warrants further investigation, it is currently common practice to standardize the content of commercially available black cohosh supplements to certain triterpene [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) related to actein, such as 23-epi-26-deoxyactein. Likewise, [pharmacokinetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44324&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PK) investigations of black cohosh triterpenes are more commonly reported.

The maximum-tolerated [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and PK of 23-epi-26-deoxyactein, the most abundant triterpene found in the plant,[[5](#cit/section_5.5)] has been evaluated in a [phase I clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Single doses of an ethanolic black cohosh extract containing 1.4 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), 2.8 mg, or 5.6 mg of 23-epi-26-deoxyactein (32 mg, 64 mg, or 128 mg of black cohosh, respectively) were administered to 15 healthy menopausal women.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] [Analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the compound in sera indicates a half-life of about 2 hours for all administered dosages (2.1 ± 0.4, 2.7 ± 0.4, and 3.0 ± 1.0 h, respectively). First-order kinetics is also indicated, with maximum [concentration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=683342&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and area under the curve increasing proportionately with dosage. It is suggested that 23-epi-26-deoxyactein is excreted intact in [bile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46508&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and degraded in the [gastrointestinal tract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46189&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), as no metabolites of the compound were detected in [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or sera, and only a negligible amount (<0.01%) of the compound was recovered in urine 24 hours after [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); specific proof of predominant [biliary](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44970&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) secretion is needed.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] In the same study, no [alteration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44643&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in circulating [hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels [(estradiol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=305990&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [follicle-stimulating hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643012&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), luteinizing hormone) was observed in this population relative to [baseline](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467830&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (*P* < .05). Changes have not been observed in similar investigations of [systemic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) hormone levels or those monitoring for estrogenic effects on [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [endometrial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45044&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [vaginal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44308&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

Although [case reports](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) suggested connections between the use of [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) containing black cohosh and [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) damage, no evidence of hepatotoxicity—or any other form of serious toxicity—was found in systematic reviews of results from [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of a chemically standardized black cohosh preparation; regardless of dosage administered, no liver function [markers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45776&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were altered.[[1](#cit/section_5.1)]

Reports of [hepatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45709&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include one case of [acute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45585&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) liver failure, two cases of *[hepatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46371&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* (without further description), and two cases indicating mild elevation of liver function markers, though many of these patients were taking multiple [botanical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367458&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) products simultaneously.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] An episode of autoimmune hepatitis is questionably related to the use of black cohosh. Although noteworthy, many of these reports are anecdotal in nature.[[6](#cit/section_5.6)] Furthermore, a [meta-analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691484&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [randomized](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [double-blind](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45673&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [controlled clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44014&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) does not demonstrate evidence of black cohosh causing adverse effects on liver function.[[7](#cit/section_5.7)] Indications of [toxicity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445093&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are reportedly caused by manufacturer contamination or adulteration with other toxic products,[[1](#cit/section_5.1)] necessitating mechanisms of botanical authentication and proper methods of manufacturing the product. The not-infrequent adulteration of black cohosh with Asian *Actaea* species that contain significantly different phytoconstituents is the most plausible cause of the reported potential adverse hepatic effects.[[8](#cit/section_5.8),[9](#cit/section_5.9)]

Acute toxicity of black cohosh is also purported to occur through interactions with pharmaceutical agents.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[10](#cit/section_5.10)] Though substantial [herb](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-[drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) interactions can occur in this manner with certain herbs such as St. John’s wort, *[in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* analysis of black cohosh [metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) does not suggest this interaction. Black cohosh [supplementation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45916&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) does not significantly alter the expression or activity of [metabolic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44056&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2E1.[[10](#cit/section_5.10)] While a [statistically significant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44167&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) decrease in the CYP2D6 [phenotype](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460203&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=genetic) (approximately 7%; *P* = .02) has been observed in a human study, the clinical relevancy of this finding is questionable [[10](#cit/section_5.10)]—especially since a very high dose was used for this particular investigation (1,090 mg bid). Studies have yet to verify this effect;[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] however, given that tamoxifen is a [selective estrogen receptor modulator](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44229&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, even mild inhibition of the enzyme by black cohosh may warrant consideration.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

### Prevention of Breast Cancer/Recurrence

[Observational studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286105&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [postmenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) women without a history of [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) indicated no significant association between the use of black cohosh and development of the disease when compared with nonuse ([hazard ratio](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=618612&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) = 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–1.82; adjusted [odds ratio](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=618610&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [OR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63–1.00).[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

One study suggested a possible protective effect. This [case-control trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348989&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) evaluated whether the use of hormone-related supplements, including black cohosh for the management of menopausal symptoms, was associated with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) risk or protection.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)] A 53% decreased risk in the [incidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46145&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of breast cancer was observed among postmenopausal women taking black cohosh compared with nonusers (adjusted OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27–0.82). In subset analyses, ever-use of tamoxifen or raloxifene prior to cancer [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (as a [chemopreventive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45487&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) agent rather than a treatment for cancer) was not a significant confounder in the protective relationship observed between black cohosh use and breast cancer occurrence.[[11](#cit/section_5.11)]

[Recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-free survival was also evaluated as a [primary endpoint](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44163&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) measure in a sample of breast cancer patients and [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (n = 18,861), 1,102 of whom had received a product containing a black cohosh extract (i.e., Remifemin® or Remifemin® plus; R/R+, a 40% isopropanol black cohosh extract, with or without St. John’s wort extract,[[12](#cit/section_5.12)] respectively).[[13](#cit/section_5.13)] This [retrospective cohort study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286525&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported a significantly lower risk of recurrence in R/R+ users compared with nonusers over a [mean](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285973&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [observation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45981&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) time of 3.6 years.[[13](#cit/section_5.13)] This decrease was observed in patients who also received tamoxifen. These results suggest that R/R+ is not likely to promote breast cancer recurrence or inhibit the [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effect of tamoxifen.[[13](#cit/section_5.13)] No other studies have reported to further explore a potential beneficial effect of black cohosh extracts on breast cancer recurrence.

### Effect on Menopausal Symptoms

Several studies have investigated black cohosh in treating women suffering from climacteric complaints, including breast cancer patients and survivors.[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[3](#cit/section_5.3)] Analyses of the effect of black cohosh preparations on these symptoms in patients with other cancers have not yet been reported.

### Breast Cancer Patients

Observational and [open-label](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285990&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) studies have demonstrated reductions in the number and severity of hot flashes among breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant [endocrine therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44411&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) complemented with black cohosh; however, randomized, double-blind, [placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) clinical trials have failed to demonstrate reductions greater than that seen with [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

Significant declines in hot flash frequency and severity and other menopausal symptoms are reported in a review of observational studies of breast cancer patients and survivors taking Remifemin® (20–40 mg/d), with or without tamoxifen or raloxifene.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] [Prospective](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44079&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) trials indicated reductions as high as 56% (95% CI = 40%–71%) in hot flash scores (daily frequency times average severity).[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] Self-[assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of menopausal symptoms through the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS II) has also been evaluated among breast cancer patients on Remifemin® (40 mg/d) plus tamoxifen (10–40 mg/d), indicating significant declines in menopausal symptomology (*P* < .001) from baseline, and after 1, 3, and 6 months of black cohosh treatment.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

Statistically significant reductions in hot flash symptomology have also been observed in open-label administration of another black cohosh product, CR BNO 1055 from Bionorica in Germany (40 mg/d), in breast cancer survivors who received [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with tamoxifen; however, double-blind studies so far have failed to show this to be a specific effect.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)]

Thus far, two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials have assessed the [efficacy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346517&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of black cohosh use (one trial used black cohosh extract;[[14](#cit/section_5.14)] the other trial used an uncharacterized black cohosh product [[15](#cit/section_5.15)]) on hot flashes—or related [vasomotor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256578&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) symptoms—in breast cancer survivors who received a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Neither study indicated a significant difference in menopausal symptomology between women taking the supplement (20–40 mg/d), or an identical-appearing placebo, with or without the use of tamoxifen (10–40 mg) or raloxifene (dosage not provided).[[2](#cit/section_5.2),[14](#cit/section_5.14)]

One randomized clinical study specifically evaluated the preventative effect of Remifemin® on symptoms of [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45090&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (MPS) in breast cancer patients who received [luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44574&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [analogs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44919&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (LHRH-a).[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] Some patients received LHRH-a treatment in addition to an [aromatase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44232&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or SERM, though no significant difference in use was found between the treatment group and the control group.[[3](#cit/section_5.3)] Evaluation of MPS was assessed using Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI) scores. Symptomology increased in both groups throughout the course of study; however, KMI scores of patients on LHRH-a treatment (goserelin, n = 32; leuprorelin, n = 10) with Remifemin® (40 mg/d) were significantly lower than those on adjuvant therapy alone (goserelin, n = 28; leuprorelin, n = 15) at each time point in this 12-week clinical trial (*P* < .01).

Given these conflicting results in observational and randomized clinical trials, a large placebo effect is presumably at play, especially considering the subjective nature of many of the [endpoint](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) measures.[[2](#cit/section_5.2)] Furthermore, the beneficial effect observed through an open-label study left unconfirmed through double-blind studies further obscured the understanding of the true effect of black cohosh in alleviating climacteric symptoms in this patient population; however, given the unlikely negative impact on breast cancer risk or recurrence,[[11](#cit/section_5.11),[13](#cit/section_5.13)] along with evidence of relative safety, more research is warranted.[[1](#cit/section_5.1),[2](#cit/section_5.2),[7](#cit/section_5.7),[10](#cit/section_5.10)]

### Noncancer Patients

The efficacy of black cohosh supplementation on vasomotor symptoms has also been evaluated in noncancer populations; however, these findings to date remain inconsistent.

At least two meta-analyses have addressed questions about the specific effect of black cohosh supplements versus placebo. The first meta-analysis [[16](#cit/section_5.16)] compared the effect of oral black cohosh monopreparations with that of the [control group](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Participants in the control group were given [red clover](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330178&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fluoxetine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45374&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or placebo. In three studies with placebo-control groups, there was no significant difference in hot flash frequency between the black cohosh group and the placebo group. The second meta-analysis included six different randomized [controlled trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44014&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that investigated the efficacy of a single formulation of black cohosh (isopropanolic black cohosh extract [iCR]) in reducing climacteric symptomology (neurovegetative and [psychological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454766&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) menopausal symptoms) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.[[17](#cit/section_5.17)] Patients who received iCR displayed significant reductions in climacteric symptoms when compared with patients who received the placebo. One study used a black cohosh/St. John’s wort [combination therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=688810&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and the other five studies used iCR alone. This meta-analysis also found that women treated with higher doses of black cohosh [monotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=754011&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) demonstrated the greatest improvement in climacteric symptomology.[[17](#cit/section_5.17)]

A comprehensive review of clinical trials that studied the use of black cohosh in noncancer menopausal and/or aging women was published in 2014. The review demonstrated that the overall heterogeneity of clinical evidence was due to major variation in exact [intervention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454757&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) materials and clinical endpoints.[[12](#cit/section_5.12),[18](#cit/section_5.18)]
Variability in study results are possibly because of differences in extract preparation methods, potentially affecting the concentration of [alkaloid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43994&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) constituents, which have not been previously studied in *[in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* and [clinical research](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774488&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Other factors that contributed to the heterogeneity included doses administered and study group characteristics.

Similarly, the Herbal Alternatives for Menopause (HALT) study investigated the effect of black cohosh (CimiPure®, 70% ethanol extract standardized to 2.5% triterpene glycosides, 160 mg/d) and an encapsulated multibotanical-containing black cohosh (ProGyne; black cohosh, 200 mg/d, along with nine other ingredients),[[19](#cit/section_5.19)] both of which failed to show a benefit greater than that of placebo.[[20](#cit/section_5.20)]

Randomized controlled investigations of black cohosh used as monopreparations [[16](#cit/section_5.16)] or within multibotanical preparations [[20](#cit/section_5.20)] have yet proven effective in reducing climacteric complaints among women without a history of breast cancer.

### Management of Other Conditions

#### Bone mineral density

The therapeutic effects of black cohosh on bone metabolism have also been investigated as a secondary [outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) measure in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, comparing results to that of conjugated estrogens (CE) and placebo.[[21](#cit/section_5.21)] Daily administration of the black cohosh extract containing commercial product CR BNO 1055 (40 mg/d) demonstrated an effect equipotent to that of CE (0.6 mg) after 3 months of treatment. Analyses of bone turnover markers indicated a significant improvement above placebo values on bone metabolism in both the black cohosh and CE groups (*P* = .0138, both groups).[[21](#cit/section_5.21)] Unlike other groups, women treated with CR BNO 1055 displayed a significant increase in [serum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44088&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels (*P* = .0358), indicating increases in bone formation. The effect demonstrated with CE supplementation was comparable, though distinct; compared with placebo, women displayed a significant decrease in bone degradation, as measured by serum levels of the C-terminal breakdown product of bone-specific type-1 [collagen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44196&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (*P* = .0181). Likewise, while the [mechanism of action](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797426&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be different than that of CE, black cohosh does appear to have an osteoprotective effect in postmenopausal women.[[21](#cit/section_5.21)] Potential benefits on bone metabolism are further supported in an uncontrolled trial by increases in osteocalcin levels in women receiving the supplement.[[22](#cit/section_5.22)]

## Adverse Effects

In general, the hydroalcoholic [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are widely used as components in commercially available products—and those used in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)—have been very well tolerated, producing rare serious [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are likely due to product quality issues (adulteration) rather than black cohosh itself. An overview of the adverse events from a systematic review of the results of several clinical trials, [postmarketing surveillance studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689749&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [case series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44006&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [case reports](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found only rare serious adverse events that may not have been induced by black cohosh.[[1](#cit/section_6.1)] The most common minor adverse effects noted in these trials were [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (e.g., [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and [musculoskeletal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44938&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (e.g., [joint](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458080&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pain, rashes).[[1](#cit/section_6.1)]

### Herb-Drug Interactions

A small number of studies have explored the potential for black cohosh extracts to interfere with the [metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or activity of [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). One group studied the *[in vivo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46352&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)* effect of black cohosh extracts on cytochrome P450 [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) up to 1,090 [mg](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44213&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) bid (0.2% triterpene glycosides) and found only weak inhibition of CYP2D6 [[2](#cit/section_6.2)] and no effect on CYP3A4.[[3](#cit/section_6.3)] A single case report suggested a possible effect of a black cohosh extract on reducing the [cholesterol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407756&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-lowering effects of statins.[[4](#cit/section_6.4)]

## Summary of the Evidence for Black Cohosh

To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of [integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the strength of the evidence (i.e., the [levels of evidence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446533&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever possible. To qualify for a level of evidence [analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390238&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a study must:

- Be published in a [peer-reviewed scientific journal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=537399&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and include sufficient parameters about the quality and reproducibility of the investigated material derived from [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Report on [therapeutic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43985&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [outcome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467853&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or outcomes, such as [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), improvement in survival, or measured improvement in [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Describe [clinical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) findings in sufficient detail for a meaningful evaluation to be made.

Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and scientific strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., [endpoints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346519&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis of CAM treatments for cancer, see [Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies](/publications/pdq/levels-evidence/cam).

The Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency describes black cohosh products as a [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that may be used for the treatment of [menopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), based on their [assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the results of around 20 [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) involving over 6,000 patients who received black cohosh.[[1](#cit/section_7.1)] However, the lack of demonstration of a clinical benefit significantly greater than that of [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=healthprofessional&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and the fact that much less research has been performed with cancer patients should lead to extra caution when its use in such patients is being considered .
