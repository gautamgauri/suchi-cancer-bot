# Pediatric Autologous HSCT (PDQ®) - NCI

# Pediatric Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version

## Collection and Storage of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) procedures require collection of growth-factor–mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) from patients using leukapheresis. Bone marrow can be used for autologous transplants, but PBSCs lead to quicker blood count recovery, resulting in less transplant-related toxicity.

Patients being considered for autologous HSCT are generally given chemotherapy to determine tumor responsiveness and minimize the risk of tumor contamination in their bone marrow. After a number of rounds of chemotherapy, patients undergo the leukapheresis procedure, either as their blood counts recover from chemotherapy or during a break between chemotherapy treatments. Growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are used to increase the number of circulating stem and progenitor cells (CD34+ cells). Collection centers monitor the number of CD34-positive cells in the patient and product each day to determine the best time to begin collection and when collection is complete. Patients with low numbers of CD34-positive cells before collection can often have their cells successfully collected using alternative mobilization approaches (e.g., addition of plerixafor).[[1](#cit/section_1.1)] The collected PBSCs are cryopreserved for later use. After completion of an intensive preparative regimen using high-dose chemotherapy, which varies according to the tumor type, the PBSCs are given to the patient at the time of transplant.

## General Indications and Considerations for Autologous Procedures

### Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Indications for Solid Tumors and Lymphomas

In pediatrics, the most common autologous HSCT indications are for the treatment of some solid tumors and lymphomas.

Autologous transplants have also been used to reset the immune system in patients with severe autoimmune disorders and to enable engraftment of genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cell progenitors to correct or ameliorate inherited disorders (e.g., immunodeficiencies, metabolic disorders, and hemoglobinopathies). These indications are not covered in this summary.

Indications for HSCT vary over time as risk classifications for a given malignancy change and the efficacy of primary therapy improves. It is best to include specific indications in the context of complete therapy for any given disease.

With this in mind, links to sections in specific summaries that cover the most common pediatric autologous HSCT indications are provided below.

6. **Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.**

- For more information, see the sections on [Treatment options for recurrent or refractory Burkitt lymphoma](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq#_797), [Treatment Options for Recurrent or Refractory Lymphoblastic Lymphoma](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq#_827), [Treatment Options for Recurrent or Refractory Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq#_839), [Treatment options for lymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq#_1652), [Treatment options for peripheral T-cell lymphoma](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq#_869), and [Treatment options for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma](/types/lymphoma/hp/child-nhl-treatment-pdq#_875) in Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment.

For autologous transplants to result in cure of malignancies, the following must apply:

- A dose-intensified chemotherapy regimen (with or without radiation therapy) with hematopoietic stem cell support is used to achieve a significantly higher cell kill than could be achieved without the use of hematopoietic stem cell support. This approach may include increased tumor kill in areas where standard-dose chemotherapy has less penetration (central nervous system).
- Meaningful percentages of cure or long-term remission from the disease must occur without significant nonhematopoietic toxicities that would otherwise limit the therapeutic benefit achieved.

The tumor-specific activity and intensity of agents used for autologous regimens have been shown to be important in improving survival.

The contamination of the collected stem cell product by persistent tumor cells is a concern with autologous approaches. Although techniques have been developed to remove or purge tumor cells from products, studies to date have shown no benefit to tumor purging.[[1](#cit/section_2.1)]
