(LOO-proh-lide MEH-zih-layt)

Prostate cancer needs hormones called androgens to grow. Testosterone is the primary male androgen. Leuprolide mesylate causes the testicles to stop making testosterone. This may stop the growth of cancer cells or shrink the tumor. Leuprolide mesylate is a type of androgen deprivation therapy called a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.
