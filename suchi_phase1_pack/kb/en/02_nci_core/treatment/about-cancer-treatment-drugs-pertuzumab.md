# Pertuzumab - NCI

# Pertuzumab

Placeholder slot

(per-TOO-zoo-mab)

Pertuzumab works by binding to HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow. The binding of pertuzumab to HER2 blocks these signals, causing the cells to stop growing and die. Pertuzumab also triggers a type of immune reaction that kills cells that have a lot of HER2. It is a type of targeted therapy drug called a monoclonal antibody.
