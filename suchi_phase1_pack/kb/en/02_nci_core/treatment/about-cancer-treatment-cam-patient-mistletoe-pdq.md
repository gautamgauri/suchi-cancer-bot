- [Mistletoe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285939&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [semiparasitic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plant that grows on many types of trees, including apple, oak, pine, and elm (see [Question 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe-pdq#_8)).
- Mistletoe [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are one of the most widely studied [complementary and alternative medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In Europe, mistletoe extracts are among the most [prescribed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for patients with cancer (see [Question 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe-pdq#_8)).
- Mistletoe extracts are usually given by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) under the skin or, less often, into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), into the [pleural cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46222&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or into a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (see [Question 2](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe-pdq#_16)).

- The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) has not approved mistletoe extracts as a treatment for cancer or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (see [Question 6](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe-pdq#_28)).

## Questions and Answers About Mistletoe

1. **What is mistletoe?**

[Mistletoe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285939&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [semiparasitic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plant that grows on many types of trees, including apple, oak, maple, elm, pine, and poplar. It has been used for hundreds of years to treat medical [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as [epilepsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44028&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [asthma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440101&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [hypertension](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44038&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), headaches, [menopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [infertility](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46348&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [dermatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45667&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [arthritis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44188&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [rheumatism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44086&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Mistletoe [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are one of the most widely studied [complementary and alternative medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In Europe, mistletoe extracts are among the most [prescribed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapies for cancer patients.

Mistletoe products vary, based on the following factors:

- The species of mistletoe.
- The type of host tree on which the mistletoe grows.
- The time of year the plant is picked.
- The type of extract used and if it is made with [homeopathic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45712&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) methods.
- The company that makes the product.

Mistletoe extracts are made in water-based solutions or solutions of water and [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Mistletoe products may be named by the type of tree on which the plant grows. For example, IscadorM is from apple trees, IscadorP comes from pine trees, IscadorQu is from oak trees, and IscadorU comes from elm trees.
2. **How are mistletoe extracts given?**

Mistletoe extracts are usually given by an [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) under the skin. Less common ways to give mistletoe extracts include by mouth, into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), into the [pleural cavity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46222&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or into a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **What laboratory or animal studies have been done using mistletoe extracts?**

In [laboratory studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a substance is tested in tumor [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to find out if it has any anticancer effects. In animal studies, a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), procedure, or treatment is tested in mice or other animals to see if it is safe and effective. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people.

Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of mistletoe extracts. For information on laboratory and animal studies using mistletoe extracts, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/mistletoe-pdq#_23) in the health professional version of this summary.
4. **Have any studies of mistletoe extracts been done in people with cancer?**

Most [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) using mistletoe extracts to treat cancer have been done in Europe. Many studies use mistletoe products as [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in patients with cancer. Although some studies have shown that mistletoe extracts can work against cancer, these findings should be read with caution because some of the studies:

- Have small numbers of participants.
- Lack detailed information about participants.
- Lack detailed information about [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Are poorly designed.

Studies with large numbers of participants reported the following:

Breast cancer

- A study in [postoperative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43980&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [early-stage breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446564&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients compared [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and mistletoe extract to standard treatment alone. Less adverse drug reactions were reported in the group given mistletoe extract.
- Another study in [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients compared survival between those who had standard therapy and mistletoe extract and those who had standard therapy alone. Improved survival was reported in the group given mistletoe extract.

Colorectal cancer

- A [retrospective cohort study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286525&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done between 1993 and 2000 looked at the use of mistletoe extract as long-term adjuvant therapy in patients treated with [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for [colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that had not spread. The study found that patients treated with mistletoe extract had longer [disease-free survival](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), fewer adverse events, and better [symptom](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) relief than patients who did not receive mistletoe extract as adjuvant therapy.

Pancreatic cancer

- A study published in 2013 looked at the use of mistletoe extract in [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Patients received best [supportive care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46609&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and were [randomly](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) assigned to receive either mistletoe extract or no [anticancer therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=639945&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Results from the study showed that patients treated with mistletoe extract had improved survival compared with those who did not receive mistletoe extract.

Non-small cell lung cancer

- Two [randomized clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that compared chemotherapy to mistletoe extract in patients with [non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported no differences in [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) between the two groups.
- A study done between 1978 and 1987 looked at the use of mistletoe extract in non-small cell lung cancer that could not be treated with [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Patients were [randomly](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322881&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) assigned to receive one of 3 treatments: (1) a mistletoe extract injection; (2) an injection made from a sheep [spleen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46593&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) said to stimulate the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and have [antitumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446109&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) effects; (3) a [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection of [vitamin B](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=556402&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Results among the 3 groups were no different in survival or tumor [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It was noted that more patients in the mistletoe extract group than in the other groups reported an improved sense of well-being.

Melanoma

- A randomized clinical trial in [melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients treated with mistletoe extract for 1 year found that there was no increase in survival time.

**Reviews of combined clinical trials**

Reviews have looked at the effects of mistletoe extract on quality of life, survival, and symptom relief in different types of cancer. Some of the studies were well designed and reported benefits for patients, while others were not. A few studies reported a difference in survival or quality of life in patients who received mistletoe extract compared with those who did not.

For more information on mistletoe extract studies, see the health professional version of [Mistletoe Extracts](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/mistletoe-pdq).
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from mistletoe extracts?**

Side effects from the use of mistletoe extracts include soreness and [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at injection sites, headache, [fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), chills, [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and feeling very tired. A few cases of severe allergic reactions, including [anaphylactic shock](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285952&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), have been reported.

One review reported that treatment with mistletoe extract did not reduce immune system response. High doses of mistletoe extract damaged the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in some cases, but the damage was repaired. Another review reported [adverse effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that included [circulatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44194&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems, [thrombophlebitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46615&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), swelling of [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [allergic reactions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=443292&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In an [observational](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cohort study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285673&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), three types of mistletoe extract (Iscador, Helixor, and abnobaVISCUM) were found to be safe in a small group of cancer patients with [autoimmune diseases](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
6. **Is mistletoe extract approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has not approved the use of mistletoe extract as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of mistletoe extracts in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

## General CAM Information

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.

Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.

Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.

## Evaluation of CAM Therapies

It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer.

Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.

[The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm "https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm") which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

## Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM

When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:

- What side effects can be expected?
- What are the risks related to this therapy?
- What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
- Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
- Will the therapy affect conventional treatment?
- Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
- If so, who is the sponsor of the trial?
- Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
