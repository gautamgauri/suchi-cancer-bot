Datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk is a type of targeted therapy drug called an antibody–drug conjugate. It consists of a monoclonal antibody linked to a toxic drug called deruxtecan that binds to a protein on the surface of some cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cancer cells and blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I. This damages the DNA of the cancer cells and kills them.
