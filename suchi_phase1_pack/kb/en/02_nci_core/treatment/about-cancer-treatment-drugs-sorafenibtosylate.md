# Sorafenib Tosylate

Placeholder slot

(sor-A-feh-nib TOH-suh-layt)

Sorafenib tosylate works by blocking proteins that signal cancer cells to divide. It also blocks proteins that signal the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Blocking these signals keeps cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Sorafenib is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).
