What is radiation proctitis?

Radiation [proctitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000454770&version=Patient&language=en) can happen when [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044971&version=Patient&language=en) damages the lining of the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046555&version=Patient&language=en). Radiation proctitis causes [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000306496&version=Patient&language=en) and other digestive issues and is most common in people who receive radiation therapy aimed at the rectum and [sigmoid colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000357588&version=Patient&language=en) (lower part of the colon). Radiation therapy for [rectal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000529764&version=Patient&language=en), [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000445079&version=Patient&language=en), and [cervical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000444973&version=Patient&language=en) cancers is most likely to cause radiation proctitis.

Radiation proctitis can be [acute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045585&version=Patient&language=en) or chronic. Acute radiation proctitis begins shortly after you start radiation treatment and goes away a few weeks after radiation treatment ends.

Learn more about chronic radiation proctitis, including its symptoms and how to manage them, in the Digestive System Problems section in [Late Effects of Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/late-effects).

What are signs and symptoms of radiation proctitis?

It’s important to tell your doctor if you notice any of these problems. Signs and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045022&version=Patient&language=en) of radiation proctitis include:

#### Learn about other digestive system problems in people with cancer

- [Diarrhea](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/diarrhea)
- [Constipation](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation)
- [Bowel Obstruction](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/bowel-obstruction)
- [Radiation Enteritis](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/radiation-enteritis)

- diarrhea
- frequent or persistent urges to have a [bowel movement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000651179&version=Patient&language=en)
- abdominal pain or cramps
- blood or mucus in [stool](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046605&version=Patient&language=en)

These symptoms are often more severe if you have chronic radiation proctitis. Chronic radiation proctitis may also cause symptoms such as rectal pain and bleeding and being unable to control your bowel movements.

Symptoms of radiation proctitis may be caused by conditions other than radiation proctitis, so tell your doctor about any digestive problems to get a proper diagnosis and treatment.

Radiation enteritis is a condition with symptoms like those of radiation proctitis, but radiation enteritis is caused by damage to the lining of the [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046335&version=Patient&language=en). Learn more at [Radiation Enteritis](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/radiation-enteritis).

Risk factors for radiation proctitis

Your risk of developing radiation proctitis may be higher if you:

- received radiation therapy over a large area of your [pelvis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046246&version=Patient&language=en)
- received large doses of radiation
- received radiation after surgery to the pelvis
- received [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045214&version=Patient&language=en) at the same time as radiation therapy
- have [diabetes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044911&version=Patient&language=en), [inflammatory bowel disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045737&version=Patient&language=en), [high blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000458091&version=Patient&language=en), or diseases that affect the blood vessels
- smoke or use other forms of tobacco

Talk with your doctor or nurse about steps you can take to lower your risk of developing radiation proctitis. Keep in mind that newer radiation therapy techniques may lower the risk of radiation proctitis in people being treated for cancer. [Stereotactic body radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000386233&version=Patient&language=en) and [intensity-modulated radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000335073&version=Patient&language=en), for example, may help avoid damage to the rectum’s healthy cells during treatment.

How is radiation proctitis diagnosed?

If you have symptoms of radiation proctitis, your doctor will do a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000270871&version=Patient&language=en) and ask about your symptoms and your current or prior cancer treatments. Your doctor may also use imaging tests such as a [sigmoidoscopy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045880&version=Patient&language=en), [CT scan](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046033&version=Patient&language=en), or [MRI](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045788&version=Patient&language=en) to diagnose radiation proctitis and plan treatment.

You may also need a [stool test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046606&version=Patient&language=en) and [blood test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000688783&version=Patient&language=en) to rule out infection or other conditions that may be causing your symptoms.

How is radiation proctitis managed and treated?

If you develop radiation proctitis during or shortly after receiving radiation therapy, your treatment may focus on relieving symptoms. Your doctor may suggest medicines and changes to your diet, such as eating frequent small meals, [low-fiber foods](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nutrition/low-fiber-foods), and foods high in [sodium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044731&version=Patient&language=en) or [potassium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044344&version=Patient&language=en).

Learn about specific food and drink choices that could help you manage diarrhea from radiation proctitis at [Diarrhea and Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/diarrhea). You can also find helpful tips on managing symptoms of radiation proctitis at [Nutrition During Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nutrition) and in our booklet [Eating Hints: Before, During, and After Cancer Treatment](/publications/patient-education/eating-hints).

Learn more about how chronic radiation proctitis is managed in the Digestive System Problems section in [Late Effects of Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/late-effects).

- What symptoms or problems should I call you about?
- What medicines can I take for diarrhea and other radiation proctitis symptoms?
- What can help decrease rectal pain and irritation?
- What liquids and foods should I have each day? What ones should I avoid?

Getting support if you have radiation proctitis

Side effects like radiation proctitis can be hard to deal with, both physically and emotionally. It’s important to ask for support from your health care team. They can help you prepare for and make it through difficult times.

Caring for someone with radiation proctitis

For family members and friends who are caring for someone with cancer, you may find these [suggestions for caregivers](/about-cancer/coping/caregiver-support) to be helpful.

Here are some ways to help your loved one:

- Encourage the person you are caring for to drink water or other fluids their doctor suggests. Provide them with a water bottle they can carry and refill throughout the day.
- Try to keep the person’s pantry stocked with foods that can help relieve radiation proctitis symptoms. Learn more about these foods at [Diarrhea and Cancer Treatment](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/diarrhea).
- Encourage the person you are caring for to take warm, shallow baths (sometimes called sitz baths) that can help relieve pain and irritation from diarrhea.
