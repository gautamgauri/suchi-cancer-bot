(PEH-mih-GA-tih-nib)

Pemigatinib works by blocking the activity of abnormal FGFR2 proteins that signal cancer cells to divide. This keeps cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Pemigatinib is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).

## Use in Cancer

Pemigatinib
is approved to treat adults with:

- **[Cholangiocarcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335064&version=Patient&language=English)** (bile duct cancer) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. It is used in patients whose cancer has already been treated and has an *[FGFR2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798333&version=Patient&language=English)* [gene fusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613509&version=Patient&language=English) or other change in the structure of the *FGFR2* gene.¹
- **[Myeloid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46279&version=Patient&language=English)** or **[lymphoid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46298&version=Patient&language=English)** cancer that has come back or did not respond to treatment and has a certain change in the structure of the *FGFR1* gene.

¹This use is approved under FDA’s [Accelerated Approval Program](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm). As a condition of approval, a [confirmatory trial(s)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799146&version=Patient&language=English) must show that pemigatinib provides a clinical benefit in these patients.

Pemigatinib
is also being studied in the treatment of other types of
