Pembrolizumab works by binding to the protein PD-1 on the surface of certain immune cells called T cells, which keeps cancer cells from suppressing the immune system. This allows the immune system to attack the cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

¹This use is approved under FDA’s [Accelerated Approval Program](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm).
