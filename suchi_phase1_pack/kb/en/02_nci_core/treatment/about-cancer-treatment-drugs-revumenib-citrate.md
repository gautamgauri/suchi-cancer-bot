# Revumenib Citrate

Revumenib citrate works by binding to a protein called menin. This prevents menin from interacting with a rearranged form of the KMT2A protein made by an abnormal KMT2A gene found in some leukemia cells. Blocking the interaction between menin and the rearranged KMT2A protein helps slow or stop the growth of leukemia cells. Revumenib citrate is a type of targeted therapy called a menin inhibitor.
