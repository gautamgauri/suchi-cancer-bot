It is used with trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide.

- With trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide in patients who have had surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=Patient&language=English).
- Alone or with trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide in patients whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.
