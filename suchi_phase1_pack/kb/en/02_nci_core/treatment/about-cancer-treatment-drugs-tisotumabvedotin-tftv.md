Tisotumab vedotin is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate. Antibody-drug conjugates consist of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a cancer-killing drug. The monoclonal antibody binds to a protein on the surface of some cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cancer cells and kills them. Tisotumab vedotin may also stimulate the immune system to kill cancer cells. It is a type of targeted therapy.
