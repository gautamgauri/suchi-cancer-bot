## Use in Cancer

Sirolimus protein-bound particles
are approved to treat adults with:

- **[Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=782531&version=Patient&language=English)** that are [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=Patient&language=English) or cannot be removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=Patient&language=English).

Sirolimus protein-bound particles are a form of [sirolimus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45513&version=Patient&language=English) contained in [nanoparticles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653131&version=Patient&language=English) (very tiny particles of protein). The drug is also called nanoparticle albumin-bound [rapamycin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285947&version=Patient&language=English). This form may work better than other forms of sirolimus and have fewer side effects.

Sirolimus protein-bound particles
are also being studied in the treatment of other types of
[cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=Patient&language=English).
