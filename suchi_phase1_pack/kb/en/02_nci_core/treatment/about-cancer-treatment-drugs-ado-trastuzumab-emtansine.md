Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a type of targeted therapy drug called an antibody–drug conjugate. It is a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a chemotherapy drug. The antibody portion binds to HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow, and delivers a drug called emtansine (or DM-1), a microtubule inhibitor, to those cells, killing them. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine may also stimulate the immune system to kill cancer cells.
