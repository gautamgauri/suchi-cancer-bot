Paclitaxel albumin-stablilized nanoparticle formulation is a different form of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, which blocks cell division by interfering with microtubules (cellular structures that help move chromosomes during mitosis) and stopping mitosis (cell division). This eventually causes cells to die. The nanoparticle formulation allows higher doses to be given without increased side effects.

US Brand Name(s)

Abraxane

FDA Approved

Yes

[FDA label information for this drug is available at DailyMed.](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=24d10449-2936-4cd3-b7db-a7683db721e4&audience=consumer)

## Use in Cancer

Paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation is approved to be used alone or with other drugs to treat:

- **[Breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=Patient&language=English)** that has [relapsed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45866&version=Patient&language=English) or spread to other parts of the body after treatment with other chemotherapy.
- **[Non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread. It is used with [carboplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45182&version=Patient&language=English) as the first treatment in patients whose cancer cannot be treated with surgery or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[Pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread to other parts of the body. It is used with [gemcitabine hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508951&version=Patient&language=English) as the first treatment.

Paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.

Paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation is a form of [paclitaxel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45258&version=Patient&language=English) contained in [nanoparticles](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=653131&version=Patient&language=English) (very tiny particles of [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=Patient&language=English)). The drug is also called nanoparticle paclitaxel and protein-bound paclitaxel. This form may work better than other forms of paclitaxel and have fewer [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=Patient&language=English).
