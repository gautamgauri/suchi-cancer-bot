Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy
works by binding to and blocking the protein PD-1 on the surface of some cancer cells, which keeps cancer cells from suppressing the immune system. This allows the immune system to attack the cancer cells. Hyaluronidase is a recombinant human form of an enzyme that breaks down a substance in the body called hyaluronic acid. This increases the absorption of drugs into tissue. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is a form of nivolumab that is given as an injection under the skin. This form can be given in less time than nivolumab, which is given through a vein. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is a type of immunotherapy drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

## Use in Cancer

Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy
is approved to be used alone or with other drugs to treat adults with:

- **[colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=Patient&language=English).** Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is used alone to treat [microsatellite instability-high](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=789683&version=Patient&language=English) (MSI-H) or [mismatch repair deficient](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=789741&version=Patient&language=English) (dMMR) cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and got worse after treatment with a [fluoropyrimidine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386207&version=Patient&language=English), [oxaliplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45465&version=Patient&language=English), and [irinotecan hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=635811&version=Patient&language=English). It may be used after treatment with [nivolumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=767747&version=Patient&language=English) and [ipilimumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=535555&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[esophageal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444989&version=Patient&language=English)** or **[gastroesophageal junction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302458&version=Patient&language=English) cancer**. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is used:
- for esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has been treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and then surgery to completely remove the cancer, but cancer cells were found in the removed tumor or [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=Patient&language=English)
- for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread or come back after treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and [platinum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45841&version=Patient&language=English)-based chemotherapy
- for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. It is given with a fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy as the first treatment
- **[gastric (stomach) cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454513&version=Patient&language=English)**, **gastroesophageal junction cancer**, or **esophageal adenocarcinoma** that has spread. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is used with a fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy.¹
- **[hepatocellular carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46363&version=Patient&language=English)** in patients whose cancer was treated with [sorafenib tosylate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509041&version=Patient&language=English) and after treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab
- **[melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=Patient&language=English).** Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is used:
- for cancer that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery
- for cancer that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery and has been treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab
- as [adjuvant therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45587&version=Patient&language=English) in patients with one of the following stages of melanoma that has been completely removed by surgery: [stage IIB](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45137&version=Patient&language=English), [IIC](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45137&version=Patient&language=English), [IIIA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45138&version=Patient&language=English), [IIIB](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793005&version=Patient&language=English), [IIIC](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793008&version=Patient&language=English), [IIID](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=793010&version=Patient&language=English), or [IV melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45139&version=Patient&language=English)
- **[non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English).** Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is used:
- with platinum-based chemotherapy before surgery for [early-stage cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561398&version=Patient&language=English)
- with platinum-based chemotherapy before surgery for early-stage cancer that does not have an abnormal *[EGFR](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=796876&version=Patient&language=English)* or *[ALK](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=721252&version=Patient&language=English)* gene and then alone after surgery
- alone for cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has gotten worse during or after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients whose cancer has an abnormal *EGFR* or *ALK* gene should receive nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy only if their cancer got worse after treatment with [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=Patient&language=English)-approved therapy for these gene mutations.
- **[renal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=661352&version=Patient&language=English)** (a type of [kidney cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444995&version=Patient&language=English)) that is [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=Patient&language=English).

- **[squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=597171&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread to other parts of the body or has come back and got worse during or after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy

¹This use is approved under FDA’s [Accelerated Approval Program](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm). As a condition of approval, [confirmatory trial(s)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799146&version=Patient&language=English) must show that nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy provides a clinical benefit in these patients.
