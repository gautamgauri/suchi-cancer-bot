# Everolimus - NCI

# Everolimus

Placeholder slot

(eh-veh-ROH-lih-mus)

Everolimus works by blocking the activity of a protein called mTOR, a kinase (enzyme) that is found in high amounts in some cancer cells. Blocking mTOR stops the growth of cancer cells and the growth of blood vessels that support tumor growth. Everolimus also lowers the body’s immune response. Everolimus is a targeted therapy drug that acts as a kinase inhibitor, an angiogenesis inhibitor, and an immunosuppressant.
