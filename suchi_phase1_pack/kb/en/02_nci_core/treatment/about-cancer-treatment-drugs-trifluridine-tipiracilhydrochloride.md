# Trifluridine and Tipiracil Hydrochloride

Placeholder slot

(try-FLOOR-ih-deen … ty-PEER-uh-sil HY-droh-KLOR-ide)

This chemotherapy combination contains the drugs trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride. Trifluridine enters cells and gets incorporated into the DNA, which keeps it from being copied. This stops cells from dividing. Tipiracil hydrochloride prevents trifluridine from being broken down in the body so it can kill more cancer cells.
