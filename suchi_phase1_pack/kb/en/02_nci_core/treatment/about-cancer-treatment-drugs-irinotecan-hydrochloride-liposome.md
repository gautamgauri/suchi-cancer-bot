## Use in Cancer

Irinotecan sucrosofate
is approved in adults to treat:

- **[Pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread to other parts of the body. It is used:
- With [oxaliplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45465&version=Patient&language=English), [fluorouracil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46090&version=Patient&language=English), and [leucovorin calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613205&version=Patient&language=English) as the first treatment.
- With [fluorouracil](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46090&version=Patient&language=English) and [leucovorin calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613205&version=Patient&language=English) in patients whose cancer got worse after treatment that included [gemcitabine hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508951&version=Patient&language=English).

Irinotecan sucrosofate
is also being studied in the treatment of other types of
cancer.

Irinotecan sucrosofate is a form of [irinotecan hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=635811&version=Patient&language=English) contained inside [liposomes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615392&version=Patient&language=English) (very tiny particles of fat). This form may work better than other forms of irinotecan hydrochloride and have fewer [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=Patient&language=English). Also, because its effects last longer in the body, it doesn't need to be given as often.
