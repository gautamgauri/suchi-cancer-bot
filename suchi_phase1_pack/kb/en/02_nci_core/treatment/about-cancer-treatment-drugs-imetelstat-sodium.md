Imetelstat sodium works by blocking the activity of an enzyme called telomerase, which is found at high levels in cells that divide rapidly, including cancer cells. Blocking this enzyme keeps cancer cells from dividing and causes them to die. Imetelstat sodium is a type of targeted therapy called an enzyme inhibitor.
