(ka-peh-SY-tuh-been )

Capecitabine is a type of chemotherapy called an antimetabolite, which is a drug that mimics a natural chemical and prevents its use in cells. When taken up by cells, capecitabine gets broken down into fluorouracil, which competes with substances that are normally used to make DNA, RNA, and proteins. This stops cancer cells and other rapidly growing cells from dividing and causes them to die.
