Exemestane is a type of hormone therapy called an aromatase inhibitor. It permanently blocks the activity of an enzyme called aromatase, which the body uses to make estrogen in the ovaries and other tissues. Blocking aromatase lowers the level of estrogen in the body. This can slow or stop the growth of cancers that need estrogen to grow.
