Kisqali Femara Co-Pack combines two drugs into one package: ribociclib succinate (Kisqali) and letrozole (Femara). Ribociclib succinate is a targeted therapy drug that blocks proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 that cancer cells need to grow. Letrozole is a hormone therapy and targeted therapy drug that blocks a protein called aromatase, which the body uses to make estrogen. Blocking aromatase lowers estrogen levels, which helps slow or stop the growth of breast cancer cells that need estrogen to grow.
