# Coenzyme Q10 - NCI

# Coenzyme Q10 (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## Overview

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/coenzyme-q10-pdq)

- [Coenzyme Q10](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (known as CoQ10) is a [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is made in the body. The body uses it for [cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) growth and to protect cells from damage (see [Question 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/coenzyme-q10-pdq#_20)).
- [Clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been limited to small sizes. It is not clear if the benefits reported were from the CoQ10 [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (see [Question 4](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/coenzyme-q10-pdq#_24)).
- CoQ10 may not mix safely with other [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is important that patients tell their [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about all drugs they are taking (see [Question 5](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/coenzyme-q10-pdq#_25)).
- CoQ10 is sold as a [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rather than a drug and is not regulated by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) (see [Question 6](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/coenzyme-q10-pdq#_26)).

## Questions and Answers About Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

1. **What is CoQ10?**

[CoQ10](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=347384&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is made in the body. The Q and the 10 in coenzyme Q10 refer to the groups of [chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that make up the product. CoQ10 is also known by the following names:

- Q10.
- Vitamin Q10.
- Ubiquinone.
- Ubidecarenone.

A coenzyme helps an [enzyme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) do its job. An enzyme is a [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that speeds up
the rate at which chemical reactions take place in cells of the body. The body's cells use CoQ10 to make energy needed for the cells to grow and stay healthy. The body also uses CoQ10 as an [antioxidant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). An antioxidant protects cells from chemicals called [free radicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44030&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

CoQ10 is found in most body [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The highest amounts are found in the heart, [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [kidneys](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The lowest amounts are found in the [lungs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). CoQ10 decreases in the body as people get older.
2. **How is CoQ10 given?**

CoQ10 is taken by mouth as a tablet or [capsule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It may also be given by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([IV](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46326&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using CoQ10?**

In [laboratory studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), tests are done to see if a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people.

Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of coenzyme Q10. See the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/coenzyme-q10-pdq#_17) section of the health professional version of Coenzyme Q10 for information on laboratory and animal studies done using CoQ10.
4. **Have any studies of CoQ10 been done in people?**

There have been few [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that study the use of CoQ10 in patients with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

A trial of 236 [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) patients were [randomized](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322881&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to receive either CoQ10 or [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), each combined with [vitamin E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), for 24 weeks. The study found that levels of [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) were not improved in patients who received CoQ10 compared to patients who received the placebo.

A [randomized trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of 20 children treated for [acute lymphoblastic leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45586&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [non-Hodgkin lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45148&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) looked at whether CoQ10 would protect the heart from the damage caused by [doxorubicin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=560140&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The results reported that CoQ10 decreased the harmful effects of doxorubicin on the heart.

Clinical trials have been limited to small numbers of people, and it is not clear if the benefits reported were from the CoQ10 [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), other [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [standard treatments](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used before or during the CoQ10 therapy.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from CoQ10?**

Reported [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the use of CoQ10 include the following:

- High levels of [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Heartburn.
- Headache.
- Pain in the upper part of the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Dizziness.
- Rashes.
- Unable to fall sleep or stay asleep.
- Feeling very tired.
- Feeling irritable.
- Sensitive to light.

Importantly, clinical trials that studied the use of CoQ10 to prevent [toxic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43986&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) side effects during cancer treatments (for example, [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) have not followed patients over the long term to find whether CoQ10 made the treatments less effective.

A recent [observational study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=286105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in patients with [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) suggested that the use of [antioxidant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) supplements, including CoQ10, before and during cancer treatment may be linked with increased [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) rates and decreased survival.

It is important to check with [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to find out if CoQ10 can be safely used with other drugs. Certain drugs, such as those that are used to lower [cholesterol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels, may decrease the effects of CoQ10. CoQ10 may change the way the body uses [warfarin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45249&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a drug that prevents the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from [clotting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476017&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and [insulin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46187&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
6. **Is CoQ10 approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of CoQ10 as a treatment for cancer.

The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of CoQ10 supplements may not be the same.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of coenzyme Q10 in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

## General CAM Information

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.

Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.

Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.

## Evaluation of CAM Therapies

It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer.

Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.

[The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm "https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm") which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

## Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM

When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:

- What side effects can be expected?
- What are the risks related to this therapy?
- What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
- Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
- Will the therapy affect conventional treatment?
- Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
- If so, who is the sponsor of the trial?
- Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
