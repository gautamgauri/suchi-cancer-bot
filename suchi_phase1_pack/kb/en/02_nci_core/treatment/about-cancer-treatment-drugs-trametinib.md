to be used alone or with [dabrafenib mesylate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=750069&version=Patient&language=English) to treat patients whose cancer has a certain [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=Patient&language=English) in the *[BRAF](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561325&version=Patient&language=English)* gene, including:

- **[Anaplastic thyroid cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44541&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread and cannot be treated with [local therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45755&version=Patient&language=English). It is used with dabrafenib mesylate.
- **[Glioma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44541&version=Patient&language=English)** that is [low grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386213&version=Patient&language=English) in children aged 1 year and older who require [systemic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45922&version=Patient&language=English). It is used with dabrafenib mesylate.
- **[Melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=Patient&language=English).** It is used:
- With dabrafenib mesylate in patients who have had surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=Patient&language=English).
- Alone or with dabrafenib mesylate in patients whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.
- **[Non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread to other parts of the body. It is used with dabrafenib mesylate.

As a condition of approval, a [confirmatory trial(s)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799146&version=Patient&language=English) must show that trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide provides a clinical benefit in these patients.
