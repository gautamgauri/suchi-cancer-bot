# Drugs Approved for Solid Tumors Anywhere in the Body - NCI

# Drugs Approved for Solid Tumors Anywhere in the Body

This page lists cancer drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of solid tumors based on their genetic and molecular features and not on where the tumors originated in the body. This treatment approach is often called tissue-agnostic therapy or tumor-agnostic therapy.

The list includes generic names and brand names. The drug names link to NCI's Cancer Drug Information summaries. There may be tissue-agnostic drugs used in solid tumors that are not listed here.
