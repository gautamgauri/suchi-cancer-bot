Tarlatamab-dlle
(Imdelltra) works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and lung cancer cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the lung cancer cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called DLL3 on small cell lung cancer cells. Tarlatamab-dlle is a type of immunotherapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE).
