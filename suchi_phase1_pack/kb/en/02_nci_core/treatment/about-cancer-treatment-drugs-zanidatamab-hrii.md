Zanidatamab-hrii
works by binding to two specific sites on the HER2 protein, which is found in high levels on the surface of some cancer cells. This binding damages the HER2 protein and lowers the amount of it on the cell surface. Zanidatamab-hrii also helps the immune system kill cancer cells. These combined actions may slow or stop the growth of HER2-positive cancer cells. Zanidatamab-hrii is a type of targeted therapy called a bispecific HER2-directed antibody.
