- **[Non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English)** (NSCLC). It is used in patients who have received at least one other [systemic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45922&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[Colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=Patient&language=English).** It is used with [cetuximab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45467&version=Patient&language=English) in patients who have received chemotherapy that included a [fluoropyrimidine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386207&version=Patient&language=English), [oxaliplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45465&version=Patient&language=English), and [irinotecan hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=635811&version=Patient&language=English).
