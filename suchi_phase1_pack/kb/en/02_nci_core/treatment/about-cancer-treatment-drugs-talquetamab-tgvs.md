Talquetamab-tgvs works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and myeloma cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the the myeloma cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called GPRC5D on myeloma cells. Talquetamab-tgvs is a type of immunotherapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE).
