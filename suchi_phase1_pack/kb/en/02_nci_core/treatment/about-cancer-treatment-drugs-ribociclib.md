Ribociclib succinate works by blocking the activity of proteins called CDK4 and CDK6 that control how fast cells grow. Blocking these proteins may slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Ribociclib succinate is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).

## Use in Cancer

Ribociclib succinate is approved to be used with other drugs to treat:

- **[breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=Patient&language=English)** that is [hormone receptor positive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=788029&version=Patient&language=English) (HR+) and [HER2 negative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774531&version=Patient&language=English) (HER2-). It is used:
- with an [aromatase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44232&version=Patient&language=English) in women who have stage II or stage III [early breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446564&version=Patient&language=English) that is at high risk of coming back
- with an [aromatase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44232&version=Patient&language=English) in women whose cancer has spread and has not been treated with [hormone therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=Patient&language=English)
