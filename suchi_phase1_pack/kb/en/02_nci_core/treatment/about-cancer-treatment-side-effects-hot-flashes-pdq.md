### Hot flashes and night sweats are common in people with cancer and survivors.

A [hot flash](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a sudden warm feeling over your face, neck, and chest that may cause you to sweat and your face to turn red. Sweating is your body's way of
lowering body temperature by causing heat loss through your skin. Hot flashes combined with sweats that happen while sleeping are often called **night sweats** or **hot flushes**. Hot flashes and night sweats are common in people receiving [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment. Some people continue to have hot flashes and night sweats after cancer treatment.

### In women and men, hot flashes and night sweats may be caused by surgery, radiation therapy, and taking certain medications.

#### Women

[Menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occurs when the [ovaries](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46687&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) stop making [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Hot flashes and night sweats are common [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of menopause. [Early menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=449953&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which the ovaries stop making estrogen at a younger age than usual. Early menopause can occur when both ovaries are removed by [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as a bilateral [oophorectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45438&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to lessen the chance cancer will occur or as part of a [hysterectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treat cancer.

Other treatments that can cause hot flashes and night sweats include:

- [Chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hormone therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [antiestrogens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([tamoxifen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509341&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and [aromatase inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44232&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Other [drug therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651195&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [tricyclic antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467872&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [steroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In people with [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), severe hot flashes have been linked with:

- Sleeping problems.
- A lot of pain.
- Poor [mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In [premenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45268&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) breast cancer [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), hot flashes and night sweats have also been linked with [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

#### Men

In men, the [testes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=367406&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) produce [testosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45581&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Surgery to remove one or both testicles for the treatment of [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can trigger a set of symptoms that include hot flashes and night sweats. Hormone therapy with [gonadotropin-releasing hormone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306499&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or estrogen also causes these symptoms in men.

Other drug therapy, such as opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and steroids, may also cause hot flashes and night sweats.

## Drug Treatment for Hot Flashes and Night Sweats in People with Cancer and Survivors

### Key Points

- Hot flashes and night sweats may be controlled with estrogen replacement therapy.
- Other drugs may be useful in some people.
- Side effects from drug therapy for hot flashes and night sweats may develop.

### Hot flashes and night sweats may be controlled with estrogen replacement therapy.

[Hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and night sweats during natural or treatment-related [menopause](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46296&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be
controlled with [estrogen replacement therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45685&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). However, many women are not able to
take estrogen replacement (for example, women who have or had [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and may need to take a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that does not have [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in it. [Hormone replacement therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46127&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that combines estrogen with [progestin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=304743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may increase the risk of breast cancer or breast cancer [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treatment of hot flashes in men who have been treated for [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include estrogens, progestin, [antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [anticonvulsants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Other drugs may be useful in some people.

Studies of non-estrogen drugs to treat hot flashes in women with a [history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of breast cancer have reported that many of them do not work as well as estrogen replacement or have
[side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Megestrol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46617&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [medroxyprogesterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=434597&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (drugs like [progesterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45158&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)), certain antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and [clonidine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=630974&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a drug used to treat [high blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458091&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are non-estrogen drugs used to control hot flashes.

### Side effects from drug therapy for hot flashes and night sweats may develop.

Side effects of non-[hormonal drug therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46367&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may include:

- Antidepressants used to treat hot flashes over a short period of time may cause [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), dry mouth, and changes in [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some antidepressants may change how other drugs, such as [tamoxifen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509341&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), work in the body.
- Anticonvulsants used to treat hot flashes may cause fatigue, dizziness, and trouble concentrating.
- Clonidine may cause dry mouth, fatigue, [constipation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407757&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [insomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Side effects from drug therapy may vary from person to person, so treatment and [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) will be specific to your needs. If one [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) does not improve your [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), switching to another medicine may help.

## Non-Drug Treatment for Hot Flashes and Night Sweats in People with Cancer and Survivors

### Key Points

- Treatments that help people cope with stress and anxiety may help manage hot flashes.
- Comfort measures may help relieve hot flashes and night sweats.
- Herbs and dietary supplements should be used with caution.
- Acupuncture has been studied in the treatment of hot flashes.

### Treatments that help people cope with stress and anxiety may help manage hot flashes.

Treatments that change how you deal with [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and negative feelings may help you manage [hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These strategies include [cognitive behavioral therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [relaxation techniques](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They help you gain a sense of control and develop [coping skills](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450097&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to manage your [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Hypnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44675&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has also been used as a treatment for hot flashes. It is a trance-like state that allows you to be more aware, focused, relaxed, and open to suggestion. Under hypnosis, you can concentrate more clearly on a specific thought or feeling without becoming distracted. A therapist helps you to deeply relax and focus on cooling thoughts. This may lower stress levels, balance body temperature, and calm the [heart rate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and breathing rate.

Cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, or hypnosis may help hot flashes and related problems when used together with [drug therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651195&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Comfort measures may help relieve hot flashes and night sweats.

Comfort measures may be used to treat
hot flashes and night sweats related to [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment. Since body temperature goes up before a hot flash, doing the following may control body temperature and help control symptoms:

- Wear loose-fitting clothes made of cotton.
- Use fans and open windows to keep air moving.
- Practice [relaxation techniques](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44723&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Herbs and dietary supplements should be used with caution.

It is important that your [health care providers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) know about all of the [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [soy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [herbs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), you are taking with your [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Studies of [vitamin E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for the relief of hot flashes show that it is only slightly better than a [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (pill or procedure that has no effect). Most studies of soy and [black cohosh](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321355&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) show they are no better than a placebo in reducing hot flashes. Soy is rich in [estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-like substances, but how it affects [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body is unknown. Studies of ground [flaxseed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285920&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [magnesium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373087&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [oxide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463160&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to treat hot flashes have shown mixed results.

Claims are made about several other plant-based and natural products as remedies for hot flashes. These include [dong quai](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [milk thistle](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=305993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [red clover](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330178&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [licorice root extract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=549694&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [chaste tree berry](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=666207&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Since little is known about how these products work or whether they affect the risk of [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), you should talk with your doctor before using them.

### Acupuncture has been studied in the treatment of hot flashes.

[Pilot studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45838&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [acupuncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [randomized clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that compare true acupuncture and [sham](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45078&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (placebo) treatment have been done in people with hot flashes and results are mixed. A review of many studies combined showed that acupuncture had slight or no effects in people with breast cancer who had hot flashes. In contrast, a randomized clinical trial that was not included in the review showed that people with breast cancer who were given acupuncture had fewer hot flashes. Another randomized clinical trial showed that breast cancer [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who were given [electroacupuncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269415&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) had a reduction in hot flash symptoms.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the causes and treatment of hot flashes and night sweats. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
