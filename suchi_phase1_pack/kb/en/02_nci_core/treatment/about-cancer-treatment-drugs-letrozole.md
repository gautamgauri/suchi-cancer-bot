# Letrozole - NCI

# Letrozole

Placeholder slot

(LEH-truh-zole)

Letrozole works by temporarily blocking the activity of an enzyme called aromatase, which the body uses to make estrogen in the ovaries and other tissues. Blocking aromatase decreases the amount of estrogen produced by the body and may stop the growth of cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. Letrozole is a type of hormone therapy called an aromatase inhibitor.

## Use in Cancer

Letrozole is approved to be used alone or with other drugs to treat:

- **[breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=Patient&language=English)** in [postmenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=Patient&language=English) women who have any of the following types of breast cancer:
- [early-stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446564&version=Patient&language=English), [hormone receptor–positive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=788029&version=Patient&language=English) (HR+) breast cancer that has been treated
- early-stage breast cancer that has been treated with [tamoxifen citrate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509341&version=Patient&language=English) for at least 5 years
- as the first treatment for breast cancer that is [locally advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45955&version=Patient&language=English) or has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body) and is HR+
- as the first treatment for breast cancer that is locally advanced or has metastasized and it is not known whether the cancer is HR+ or [hormone receptor negative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=788033&version=Patient&language=English) (HR-)
- as the second treatment for breast cancer that has gotten worse after [antiestrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44813&version=Patient&language=English) therapy

Letrozole is also available in a combination pack with [ribociclib succinate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=787678&version=Patient&language=English). Ribociclib succinate and letrozole may work better together than when either is given alone. For more information that may apply to this combination pack, see the Drug Information Summary for [Ribociclib Succinate and Letrozole](/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ribociclib-succinate-and-letrozole).

Letrozole is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.
