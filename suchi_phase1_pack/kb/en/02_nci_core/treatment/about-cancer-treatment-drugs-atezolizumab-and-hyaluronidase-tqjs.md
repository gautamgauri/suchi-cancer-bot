Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs works by binding to the protein PD-L1 on the surface of some cancer cells, which keeps cancer cells from suppressing the immune system. This allows the immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells. Hyaluronidase is a recombinant human form of an enzyme that breaks down a substance in the body called hyaluronic acid. This increases the absorption of drugs into tissue. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs is a form of atezolizumab that is given as an injection under the skin. This form can be given in less time than atezolizumab, which is given through a vein. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs is a type of immunotherapy drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

is approved to be used alone or with other drugs to treat adults with:

- **[Alveolar soft part sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641933&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery.
- **[Hepatocellular carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46363&version=Patient&language=English)** (a type of [liver cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44242&version=Patient&language=English)) that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. It is used with [bevacizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=781154&version=Patient&language=English) in adults who have not received [systemic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45922&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[Melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=Patient&language=English)** that has a certain [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=Patient&language=English) in the *[BRAF](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561325&version=Patient&language=English)* gene. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs is used with [cobimetinib fumarate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776875&version=Patient&language=English) and [vemurafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=702051&version=Patient&language=English) in adults whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery.
- **[Non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English).** Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs is used:
- alone after surgery and [platinum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45841&version=Patient&language=English) chemotherapy in adults with [stage IIA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45357&version=Patient&language=English), [stage IIB](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=682419&version=Patient&language=English), or [stage IIIA cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45367&version=Patient&language=English) that has the [PD-L1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797389&version=Patient&language=English) [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=Patient&language=English)
- alone as the first treatment in adults whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body, has the PD-L1 protein, and does not have a mutation in the *[EGFR](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44397&version=Patient&language=English)* gene or *[ALK](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=721252&version=Patient&language=English)* gene
- with bevacizumab, [paclitaxel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45258&version=Patient&language=English), and [carboplatin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45182&version=Patient&language=English) or [paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=507600&version=Patient&language=English) and carboplatin as the first treatment in adults with non-[squamous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46056&version=Patient&language=English) cancer that does not have a mutation in the *EGFR* gene or *ALK* gene that has spread to other parts of the body
- with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin as the first treatment in patients with non-squamous cancer that does not have an abnormal *EGFR* gene or *ALK* gene and has spread to other parts of the body
- alone in adults whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body and got worse during or after treatment with platinum chemotherapy. For patients whose cancer has a mutation in the *[EGFR](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44397&version=Patient&language=English)* gene or *[ALK](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=721252&version=Patient&language=English)* gene, atezolizumab is used if their cancer has gotten worse after treatment with [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=Patient&language=English)-approved therapy for these mutations.
- **[Small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45327&version=Patient&language=English).** Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs is used with carboplatin and [etoposide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45189&version=Patient&language=English) as the first treatment in adults with [extensive-stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45911&version=Patient&language=English) cancer.
