Placeholder slot

Trastuzumab works by binding to HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow. Trastuzumab blocks the activity of HER2 and triggers a type of immune reaction that kills cells that have a lot of HER2. It is a type of targeted therapy drug called a monoclonal antibody.
