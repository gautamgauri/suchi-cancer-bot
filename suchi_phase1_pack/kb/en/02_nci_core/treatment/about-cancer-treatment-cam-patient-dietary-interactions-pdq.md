# Cancer Therapy Interactions With Foods and Dietary Supplements (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## General Information

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/dietary-interactions-pdq)

Over a third of adults with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the United States use some form of [complementary and alternative medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAM) product. CAM products may include [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [herbal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) products, and special teas. Taking anticancer [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and CAM products together may cause a person to have an undesired (adverse) reaction. Talk to your doctor about the CAM products you use before you begin treatment.

When dietary supplements, herbs, or other CAM products are taken with an anticancer drug, they could change the way the cancer drug works in a person's body. They may change how the cancer drug is absorbed and distributed ([metabolized](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) in the body [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or how it is removed ([excreted](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476338&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) from the body.

Special [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) help drugs work against cancer in the body. The [cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are important for how the body metabolizes many cancer drugs. [P-glycoprotein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643067&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a special protein that helps remove substances from [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is also involved in how cancer drugs work in a person's body. If a CAM product disturbs these systems, the cancer drug will not work like it should, and the person will not receive the full benefits of the drug.

Some studies have been done on taking CAM products with cancer drugs. This summary covers some of the possible adverse reactions from taking CAM products and cancer drugs together.

## Antioxidants

### Questions and Answers About Antioxidants

1. **What are antioxidants?**

[Antioxidants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are natural or man-made substances. They are found in foods and [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that protect [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from the damage caused by [free radicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44030&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (unstable [molecules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) made by [oxidation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44491&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) during normal [metabolism](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46173&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Free radicals may play a part in [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [heart disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748138&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [stroke](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439425&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and other diseases of aging.

Some common dietary antioxidants include the following:

- [Vitamin C](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (ascorbate).
- [Vitamin E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Flavonoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330168&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (such as [soy isoflavones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [green tea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=389271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [catechins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- [Beta-carotene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45328&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Glutathione](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
2. **How are antioxidants given or taken?**

Antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, and dietary supplements are taken by mouth.
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies been done on antioxidants and drug interactions?**

For information on laboratory and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using antioxidants, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/dietary-interactions-pdq#_180) section of the health professional version of Cancer Therapy Interactions With Foods and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies been done on antioxidants and drug interactions in people with cancer?**

One study looked at antioxidant dietary supplement use before and after [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in [postmenopausal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This study found an increased risk of death and a reduced chance of staying cancer free when antioxidant dietary supplements were used during [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Another study found similar results for people with breast cancer who used antioxidant dietary supplements before and during chemotherapy.

[Clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of people with [head and neck cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257519&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who took vitamin E supplements looked at a [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the supplements known as [alpha-tocopherol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691423&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Researchers studied alpha-tocopherol to see if it decreased [adverse reactions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44922&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although some clinical trials reported that alpha-tocopherol may reduce damage to the body caused by radiation therapy, other clinical trials found there was a higher risk of cancer coming back.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from antioxidants?**

Antioxidant dietary supplements that are taken while being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may lower the chance of staying cancer free. Some people take antioxidants because they think the supplement will protect and repair healthy cells damaged by cancer [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). More research is needed to find out if antioxidant supplements are safe and effective as a [complementary therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=806003&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when taken with [standard cancer treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
6. **Are antioxidants approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has not approved the use of antioxidants as a treatment for cancer or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Antioxidants are available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of antioxidant supplements may not be the same.

A small [randomized trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found that less of the anticancer drug [etoposide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reached the bloodstream in people who drank grapefruit juice than in people who did not drink grapefruit juice. However, studies with the anticancer drugs [imatinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44893&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [sunitinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468779&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [nilotinib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=575396&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have shown that drinking grapefruit juice increased the amount of anticancer drug that reached the bloodstream.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from grapefruit?**

Grapefruit can interact with many [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used to treat a variety of health problems. Grapefruit juice and the furanocoumarin in grapefruit seeds have been known to interact with some anticancer drugs.
6. **Is grapefruit approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has not approved the use of grapefruit as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Grapefruit is available in the United States in food products or as a dietary supplement. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of grapefruit seed extracts may not be the same.

### Questions and Answers About Green Tea

1. **What is green tea?**

[Green tea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=389271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) comes from the *Camellia sinensis* plant. Green tea has been used to lower [cholesterol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and improve weight loss, mental alertness, and digestive [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The health benefits studied in green tea are thought to be from [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [polyphenols](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Polyphenols are a group of plant [chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that include [catechins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([antioxidants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that help protect [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from damage). Catechins make up most of the polyphenols in green tea.
2. **How is green tea given or taken?**

People usually drink green tea or take it as a [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the form of a dried [herb](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or an [extract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies been done on green tea and drug interactions?**

For information on laboratory and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using green tea, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/dietary-interactions-pdq#_153) section of the health professional version of Cancer Therapy Interactions With Foods and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies been done on green tea and drug interactions in people with cancer?**

[Clinical research](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774488&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with people is limited. A case study of a patient with [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [renal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=661352&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who drank green tea while he received an anticancer [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported worse [control of symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269453&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The symptoms improved when he stopped drinking the green tea.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from green tea?**

Risks and [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) result from drinking large amounts of green tea (more than 8 cups per day). In rare cases, green tea extracts taken in pill form have caused damage to the [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Green tea may interact with other [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Studies have not determined whether green tea is safe or effective when used with anticancer drugs.
6. **Is green tea approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) has not approved the use of green tea as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The FDA Division of Drug Oncology Products recommends that green tea extract be taken with food by participants in [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and that [liver function tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390293&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) be considered during treatment.

Green tea is available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of green tea extract may not be the same.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about cancer therapy interactions with foods and dietary supplements in people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

## General CAM Information

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.

Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.

Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.

## Evaluation of CAM Therapies

It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer.

Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.

[The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm "https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm") which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

## Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM

When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:

- What side effects can be expected?
- What are the risks related to this therapy?
- What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
- Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
- Will the therapy affect conventional treatment?
- Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
- If so, who is the sponsor of the trial?
- Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
