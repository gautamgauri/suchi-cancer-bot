- **[AIDS-related](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444964&version=Patient&language=English) [Kaposi sarcoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45134&version=Patient&language=English)** that has gotten worse after treatment with other [systemic chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=301626&version=Patient&language=English), or in patients who are not able to use other drugs.
- **[Multiple myeloma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45793&version=Patient&language=English).** It is used with [bortezomib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269133&version=Patient&language=English) in patients who have already been treated with at least one type of chemotherapy and have not received bortezomib.
- **[Ovarian cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445074&version=Patient&language=English)** that has gotten worse or come back after treatment with [platinum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45841&version=Patient&language=English)-based chemotherapy.

Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.

Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome is a form of [doxorubicin hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=560140&version=Patient&language=English) contained inside [liposomes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615392&version=Patient&language=English) (very tiny particles of fat). This form may work better than other forms of doxorubicin hydrochloride and have fewer [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=Patient&language=English).
