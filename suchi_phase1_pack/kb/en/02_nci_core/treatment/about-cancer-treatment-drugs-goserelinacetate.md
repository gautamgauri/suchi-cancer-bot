(GOH-seh-REH-lin A-seh-tayt)

Goserelin acetate is a type of hormone therapy called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. It initially causes the pituitary gland to make more luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a temporary increase in testosterone levels in men and estrogen levels in women. With continued use, goserelin acetate lowers the amount of LH and FSH the pituitary gland releases, leading to a drop in testosterone levels in men and estrogen levels in women. This may stop or slow the growth of cancer cells that need testosterone or estrogen to grow. Hormones usually return to pretreatment levels a few months after stopping treatment.
