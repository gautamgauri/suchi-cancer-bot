[Immunotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045729&version=Patient&language=en) is a type of cancer treatment that strengthens your [immune system’s](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046356&version=Patient&language=en) response to cancer. One type of immunotherapy, called [immune checkpoint inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000772606&version=Patient&language=English) therapy, can trigger an [immune response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045722&version=Patient&language=English) that causes [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044042&version=Patient&language=English) to organs in your body. You’ll notice the suffix “-itis” (which means [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044042&version=Patient&language=en)) in the names of many of these conditions.

Doctors and researchers are working to learn more about the best ways to prevent or manage inflammation-related side effects. Sometimes these side effects are managed with medicines, such as [steroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046601&version=Patient&language=en), that work to slow down an overactive [immune response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045722&version=Patient&language=en). These side effects may be serious and even life-threatening. It’s important to talk with your health care team to know what signs and symptoms to expect, as well as when they may happen and what to do if they occur.

For people with an [autoimmune disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045604&version=Patient&language=English) it’s especially important to discuss this disease with your health care provider before starting treatment.

## Side Effects in People Receiving Immunotherapy

This list of side effects can be a helpful reference as you learn more from your health care team about what to expect, based on the treatment you will be receiving.

Side effects are **more common** in these organs and systems:

- **[Digestive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046446&version=Patient&language=English)****:** Inflammation to organs in your [digestive system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046446&version=Patient&language=en), called [colitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044318&version=Patient&language=English), may cause stomach or [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046684&version=Patient&language=en) pain, diarrhea, and black or bloody [stools](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046605&version=Patient&language=en). Some people have mild [hepatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046371&version=Patient&language=English), which is diagnosed during a [blood test](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000688783&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[Endocrine system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000468796&version=Patient&language=English)****:** When hormone-producing glands are inflamed you may have some of the problems listed below. Your doctor will check your hormone levels regularly to detect and diagnose these problems.
- **[Pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046229&version=Patient&language=English)** inflammation is the most common [endocrine system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000468796&version=Patient&language=en)-related [inflammatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000373080&version=Patient&language=en) problem; it may cause headaches and fatigue.

- **[Nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000446114&version=Patient&language=English)** inflammation may cause your hands, feet, and sometimes your face to tingle and feel numb or weak. Inflammation to the brain, called [encephalitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000797625&version=Patient&language=en), may cause mild [flu-like symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000797596&version=Patient&language=en) or more serious side effects, such as a sudden and high fever, confusion, [hallucinations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000476341&version=Patient&language=English), [seizures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045484&version=Patient&language=English), and [vomiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000390324&version=Patient&language=English).

## Be alert for changes and problems

It’s important to have any possible inflammatory problems assessed by your [oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046260&version=Patient&language=English). Your [oncologist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046260&version=Patient&language=en) may advise you to call him or her first about inflammatory symptoms, or you may be advised to seek emergency medical care.

Write down key information about your treatment and keep it handy, in case you need to share it with doctors in the emergency room. It’s important for other medical professionals to know you are receiving immunotherapy, so you’ll want to write down:

- the drug name(s)
- your doctor’s contact information
- your hospital’s contact information

## After talking with your health care team, make sure you have answers to these questions

- What organ-related inflammatory side effects might I have, based on the type of immunotherapy I am receiving?
- Should I try to manage any of these side effects at home?
- What side effects should I call you about? Which side effects need urgent medical care? Where should I go to get urgent medical care?
- When might these side effects start? How long might they last?
- What type of medicine or therapy is used to treat side effects that I may have?
- How long will it take to resolve any side effects?
- How long after treatment might these side effects occur?
