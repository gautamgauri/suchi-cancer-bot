¹This use is approved under FDA’s [Accelerated Approval Program](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm). As a condition of approval, a [confirmatory trial(s)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799146&version=Patient&language=English) must show that nivolumab provides a clinical benefit in these patients.

Nivolumab is given by infusion. It is available in a different form, combined with hyaluronidase, that is given [subcutaneously](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=Patient&language=English). For more information, see the Drug Information Summary for [Nivolumab and Hyaluronidase-nvhy](/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/nivolumab-and-hyaluronidase-nvhy). Nivolumab is also available as a combination formulation with a drug called relatlimab. For more information, see the Drug Information Summary for [Nivolumab and Relatlimab-rmbw](/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/nivolumab-and-relatlimab-rmbw).

Nivolumab
is also being studied in the treatment of other types of
cancer.
