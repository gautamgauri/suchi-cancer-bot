Talazoparib tosylate works by blocking the activity of PARP enzymes, which help repair damaged DNA in cells. Cancer cells with BRCA mutations or certain other gene mutations cannot use a key DNA repair process called homologous recombination (HR) and need PARP enzymes to survive. Blocking the activity of PARP enzymes causes these cancer cells to die. Talazoparib tosylate is a type of targeted therapy drug called a PARP inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).
