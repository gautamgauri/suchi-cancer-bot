Tebentafusp-tebn works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and melanoma cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the melanoma cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called gp100 on melanoma cells. Tebentafusp-tebn is a type of immunotherapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE).
