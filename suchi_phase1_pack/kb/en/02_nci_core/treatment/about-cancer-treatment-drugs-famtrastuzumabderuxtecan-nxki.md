Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a type of targeted therapy drug called an antibody–drug conjugate. It is a monoclonal antibody that is chemically linked to a topoisomerase I-inhibiting drug called deruxtecan. The monoclonal antibody portion binds to HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow. Deruxtecan enters these cells, causing DNA damage that kills them. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki also causes a type of immune reaction that kills surrounding cells.
