Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk consists of a combination of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and a recombinant enzyme called hyaluronidase-oysk, which allows trastuzumab to more easily enter tissues. Trastuzumab binds to HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow. This binding blocks the ability of HER2-positive cancer cells to send chemical signals that tell them to grow. It also stimulates the immune system to kill cells that have a lot of HER2. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk is a type of targeted therapy drug.
