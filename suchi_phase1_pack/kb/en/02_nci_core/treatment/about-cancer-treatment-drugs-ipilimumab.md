(ih-pih-LIH-myoo-mab)

Ipilimumab is a type of targeted therapy drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor (a type of immunotherapy). It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the protein CTLA-4 on immune cells called T cells. It works by keeping cancer cells from suppressing the immune system. This allows the immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells.

## Use in Cancer

Ipilimumab is approved to be used alone or with other drugs treat:

- **[colorectal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444983&version=Patient&language=English)** in adults and children aged 12 years and older. Ipilimumab is used with [nivolumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=767747&version=Patient&language=English) to treat [microsatellite instability-high](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=789683&version=Patient&language=English) (MSI-H) or [mismatch repair deficient](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=789741&version=Patient&language=English) (dMMR) cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery.
- **[esophageal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444989&version=Patient&language=English)** that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. Ipilimumab is used with nivolumab as the first treatment in adults with [squamous cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=Patient&language=English) of the [esophagus](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46408&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[hepatocellular carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46363&version=Patient&language=English)** (a type of [liver cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44242&version=Patient&language=English)) that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. Ipilimumab is used with nivolumab in adults as the first treatment or after treatment with [sorafenib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=509041&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[malignant pleural mesothelioma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44992&version=Patient&language=English).** Ipilimumab is used with nivolumab as the first treatment in adults whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery.
- **[melanoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45135&version=Patient&language=English).** Ipilimumab is used:
- alone in adults to help prevent melanoma from coming back after surgery to remove melanoma in the skin and [lymph nodes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45762&version=Patient&language=English).
- alone or with nivolumab in adults and alone in children aged 12 years and older whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body.
- **[non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English).** Ipilimumab is used as the first treatment in adults with:
- cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has the [PD-L1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=797389&version=Patient&language=English) [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=Patient&language=English) but does not have a [mutation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=Patient&language=English) in the *[EGFR](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44397&version=Patient&language=English)* or *[ALK](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=721252&version=Patient&language=English)* gene. It is used with nivolumab.
- cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or has come back and does not have a mutation in the *EGFR* or *ALK* gene. It is used with nivolumab and [platinum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45841&version=Patient&language=English) chemotherapy.
- **[renal cell carcinoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=661352&version=Patient&language=English)** (a type of [kidney cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444995&version=Patient&language=English)) that is advanced. Ipilimumab is used with nivolumab in some patients with renal cell carcinoma as the first treatment.

¹This use is approved under FDA’s [Accelerated Approval Program](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm). As a condition of approval, a [confirmatory trial(s)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799146&version=Patient&language=English) must show that ipilimumab provides a clinical benefit in these patients.

Ipilimumab is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.
