# Zolbetuximab-clzb

Placeholder slot

(ZOL-beh-TUK-sih-mab)

Zolbetuximab-clzb works by binding to a protein called CLDN18.2, which some cancer cells produce in large amounts. This helps the immune system find and attack the cancer cells. Zolbetuximab-clzb also helps weaken the cancer cell membrane, which can cause cancer cells to die. It is a type of targeted therapy called a monoclonal antibody.
