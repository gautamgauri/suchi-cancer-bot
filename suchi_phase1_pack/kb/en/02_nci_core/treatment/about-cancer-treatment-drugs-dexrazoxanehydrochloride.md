## Use in Cancer

Dexrazoxane hydrochloride is approved to treat severe [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=Patient&language=English) caused by certain types of [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=Patient&language=English). It is used to treat the following:

- **[Cardiac](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45634&version=Patient&language=English) (heart) side effects** caused by [doxorubicin hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=560140&version=Patient&language=English) in women being treated for [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=Patient&language=English) [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=Patient&language=English). Dexrazoxane hydrochloride helps make the side effects happen less often and makes them less severe when they do occur. It is used only in women who have already received high doses of doxorubicin and continue to be treated with it. This use is approved for the Totect and Zinecard brands of dexrazoxane hydrochloride.
- **[Extravasation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=570294&version=Patient&language=English)** caused by [intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=520363&version=Patient&language=English) [anthracyclines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44916&version=Patient&language=English). Extravasation occurs when [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=Patient&language=English) [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=Patient&language=English) leak out of the [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=Patient&language=English), into surrounding [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=Patient&language=English). This can cause redness, pain, and swelling, and may damage the tissue. This use is approved for the Totect brand of dexrazoxane hydrochloride.
