### Cancer, cancer treatment, or diagnostic tests may cause you pain.

Pain is one of the most common [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Pain can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, or a combination of factors. [Tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [intravenous chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=776353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [targeted therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270742&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [supportive care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46609&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as [bisphosphonates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44817&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [diagnostic procedures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45959&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may cause you pain.

Younger people are more likely to have cancer pain and [pain flares](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=778643&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) than older people. People with [advanced cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have more severe pain, and many [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have pain that continues after cancer treatment ends.

This summary is about ways to control cancer pain in adults.

### Pain can be managed before, during, and after tests and procedures.

Some tests and procedures are painful. It helps to start pain control before a procedure begins. Some [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to help you feel calm or fall asleep. [Therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as [imagery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45719&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [relaxation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689628&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can also help control pain and [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) related to treatment.
To help lower your anxiety, ask about the test before it begins so you know what to expect. Have a family member or friend stay with you during the procedure.

### Different cancer treatments may cause specific types of pain.

There are different types of pain from the treatments, including:

- [Postoperative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43980&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pain.
- [Spasms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463733&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), stinging, and itching caused by intravenous chemotherapy.
- [Mucositis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45789&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or targeted therapy.
- Ostealgia (bone pain) caused by [filgrastim](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45332&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [pegfilgrastim](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=316080&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are [granulocyte colony-stimulating factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46749&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that help the body make more [white blood cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Peripheral neuropathy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44705&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by chemotherapy or targeted therapy.
- Pain in [joints](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=458080&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and muscles caused by [paclitaxel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45258&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [aromatase inhibitor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44232&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy.
- [Osteonecrosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=723852&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the jaw caused by bisphosphonates given for cancer that has spread to the bone.
- [Avascular necrosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=723854&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by long-term use of [corticosteroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Pain [syndromes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) therapy, including:

- Pain from [brachytherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45151&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Pain from lying in the same position during treatment.
- Mucositis (inflammation of the [mucous membranes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=257212&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in areas that were treated with radiation).
- [Dermatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45667&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Pain flares](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=778643&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Peripheral neuropathy is a type of pain that can be caused by chemotherapy.

Peripheral neuropathy is a [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problem that can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet. People receiving chemotherapy may have chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). In some people, CIPN may continue after chemotherapy has ended.

Studies of [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and natural products used to treat CIPN have shown mixed results. [Duloxetine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=589399&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a drug that has been studied to treat CIPN.

Studies of [acupuncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for CIPN have been reported. For more information about these studies, visit the [Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/acupuncture-pdq#_137) section in Acupuncture.

### Cancer pain may continue after treatment ends.

Pain that is severe or continues after cancer treatment ends increases the risk of [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). If you feel depressed or have anxiety, your pain may feel worse and make it harder to control. Some people are unable to work because of the pain.

### Pain control can improve your quality of life.

Pain can be controlled in most people who have cancer. Pain control can improve your [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) during cancer treatment and after it ends.

### Each person needs a personal plan to control cancer pain.

Each person's [diagnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), cancer [stage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45885&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), response to pain, and personal likes and dislikes are different. For this reason, each person needs a personal plan to control cancer pain. You, your family, and your health care team can work together
to manage your pain. As part of your pain control plan, your [health care provider](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650566&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can give you and your family members written instructions to manage your pain at home. Ask your health care provider who you should call if you have
questions about your pain.

## Assessment of Cancer Pain

### Key Points

- Your health care team will ask you about your pain to determine the best treatment.
- Physical and neurological exams will be done to help plan pain control.

### Your health care team will ask you about your pain to determine the best treatment.

It's important that the cause
of your pain is found early and treated quickly.
Your health care team will help you measure
pain levels often, including:

- After you start [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) treatment.
- After you start a new pain treatment.
- When you have new pain.

To learn about your pain, the health care team will ask you:

- When did the pain start?
- How long does the pain last?
- Where is the pain? You will be asked to show exactly where the pain is on your body or on a drawing of a body.
- How strong is the pain? You will be asked to rate your pain between 1-10, with 10 being the strongest.
- Have there been changes in where or when the pain occurs?
- What makes the pain better or worse?
- Is the pain worse during certain times of the day or night?
- Is there [breakthrough pain](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45612&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)?
- Do you have trouble sleeping, or do you feel tired, [depressed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [anxious](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)?
- Does pain get in the way of [activities of daily life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430402&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as when you eat, bathe, or move around?

Your health care team will also review your [health history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=798522&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including:

- Past and current pain treatments.
- [Prognosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45849&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Other [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) you may have, such as [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [heart disease](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748138&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Past and current use of [nicotine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or sleeping pills.
- [Personal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [substance abuse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450123&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Personal history of [mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or abuse.
- Your choices for your pain control plan.

The
information you give your health care team will be used to decide how to help relieve your pain. Treatment may include [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or non-drug therapies. In some cases, people are referred to pain or [palliative care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269448&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) specialists. Your health care team will work with you to decide whether the benefits of treatment outweigh any risks. They will also let you know how much relief to expect from your pain treatment. Your doctor will continue to ask you how well your treatment is working and make changes if needed.

A family member or [caregiver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be asked to give answers for a person who has problems with speech, language, or understanding.

### Physical and neurological exams will be done to help plan pain control.

The following exams will be done:

- **[Physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual.
- **[Neurological exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)**: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) function. The exam checks your mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, [senses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=792756&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.

Your health care team will also assess your [psychological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), social, and [spiritual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441265&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) needs.

## Using Drugs to Control Cancer Pain

### Key Points

- Drugs will be given based on whether your pain is mild, moderate, or severe.
- Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be given to relieve mild pain.
- Opioids are given to relieve moderate to severe pain.
- Most people with cancer pain will receive opioids on a regular schedule.
- Opioids are given in different ways.
- There are common side effects caused by opioids.
- Other drugs may be added to help treat your pain.

### Drugs will be given based on whether your pain is mild, moderate, or severe.

Your doctor will [prescribe](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help relieve your pain. These drugs need to be taken at scheduled times to keep a constant level of the drug in the body to help keep the pain from coming back. Drugs may be taken by mouth or given in other ways, such as by [infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45738&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Your doctor may prescribe extra [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of a drug for pain that occurs between scheduled doses of the drug. The doctor will adjust the drug dose for your
needs.

A scale from 0 to 10 is used to measure how severe the pain is and decide which pain [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to use. On this scale:

- 0 means no pain.
- 1 to 3 means mild pain.
- 4 to 6 means moderate pain.
- 7 to 10 means severe pain.

Other pain scales that use happy or sad faces may be used for those who have trouble giving their pain a number. These scales are useful for adults who have trouble with memory or thinking, and with young children.

### Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be given to relieve mild pain.

[Acetaminophen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45165&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [NSAIDs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) help relieve mild pain. They may be given with [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
for moderate to severe pain.

Pain relievers of this type include:

- [Celecoxib](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45969&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Diclofenac](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=617660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Ibuprofen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=613511&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Ketoprofen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=778495&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Ketorolac](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45305&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

[Side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [NSAIDs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) include [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [kidney](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), heart, and [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems. People, especially those who are older, who take acetaminophen or
NSAIDs need to be closely watched for [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Learn more in the [Treating Cancer Pain in Older People](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-pdq#_74) section.

### Opioids are given to relieve moderate to severe pain.

Opioids work well to relieve moderate to severe pain.
Some people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) stop getting pain relief from opioids if they take them for a long time. This is called [tolerance](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44739&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Larger doses or a different opioid may be needed if your body stops [responding](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to the same dose.
Tolerance of an opioid is a [physical dependence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454765&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on it. This is not the same as [addiction](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44639&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([psychological](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) dependence).

Since 1999, the number of [prescriptions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) written for opioids and the number of deaths caused by drug [overdose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450114&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the United States have increased. Although most people who are prescribed opioids for cancer pain use them safely, some may become addicted to opioids. Your doctor will monitor your opioid doses so that you are treated for pain safely.

There are several types of opioids:

- [Buprenorphine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=778475&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Codeine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=546735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Fentanyl](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45197&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hydrocodone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641862&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hydromorphone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45217&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Methadone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454762&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Morphine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45400&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the most common opioid
for cancer pain).
- [Oxycodone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454764&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Oxymorphone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=714353&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Tapentadol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=723438&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Tramadol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641915&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The doctor will prescribe drugs and the times they should be taken to best control your pain. It is important that patients and family caregivers know how to safely use, store, and dispose opioids.

#### Most people with cancer pain will receive opioids on a regular schedule.

Opioids are given on a regular
schedule to help relieve the pain and keep it from getting worse. The amount of time between doses depends on which opioid you take. The best dose is the amount of opioid that controls your pain
with the fewest side effects. If opioid
tolerance does occur (the opioid no longer works at the dose you are given), the dose may need to be increased or a different opioid may be prescribed.

There is evidence that people who are prescribed long-acting opioids (for example, medications that work for 8,12, or 24 hours), are more likely to take them as directed.

#### Opioids are given in different ways.

Opioids may be given by the following ways:

- **Mouth:** If your stomach and [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) work normally, [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is usually taken by mouth. Opioids given [orally](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are easy to use and are usually low-cost. [Oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) opioids are absorbed when placed under the tongue (sublingual route) or on the inside of the cheek (buccal route).
- **[Rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):** If you cannot take opioids by mouth, they may be given as [rectal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [suppositories](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=467864&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- **Skin patches:** Opioid patches are placed on the skin (transdermal route).
- **Nose spray:** Opioids may be given in the form of a [nasal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44061&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) spray.
- **[Intravenous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46682&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (IV) line:** Opioids are given into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) when simpler and less costly
methods cannot be used, don't work, or are not wanted. [Patient-controlled analgesia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44703&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PCA) [pumps](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46197&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are one way to control pain through your IV line. A PCA pump allows you to control the amount of drug that is used. With a PCA pump, you can receive a preset opioid dose by pressing a button on a pump that is connected to a small tube. Once the pain is controlled, the doctor may
prescribe regular opioid doses based on the amount you used with the PCA pump.
- **[Subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection:** Opioids are injected into the fatty layer of [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) just under the skin.
- **[Intraspinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454759&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) injection:** Opioids are injected into the fluid around the [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These may be combined with a [local anesthetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to help some people who have pain that is hard to control.

#### There are common side effects caused by opioids.

Your doctor will discuss the side effects with you before opioid
treatment begins and will watch you for side effects. The following are the most
common side effects:

- [Nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Drowsiness.
- [Constipation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407757&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Nausea and drowsiness most often occur when opioid treatment
is first started and usually get better within a few days.

Opioids slow down the muscle contractions and movement in the stomach and
intestines, which can cause hard [stools](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46605&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). To keep the stool soft and prevent constipation, it's important to drink plenty of [fluids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), increase [fiber](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and get regular exercise. Unless there are problems such as a blocked [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), you will be given a treatment plan to prevent constipation and other digestive problems while taking opioids.

Other side effects of
opioid treatment include:

- Dry mouth.
- [Vomiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Low [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Dizziness.
- Trouble sleeping.
- Trouble thinking clearly.
- [Sedation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=730363&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Delirium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450100&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [hallucinations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476341&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Muscle jerks.
- [Seizures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hyperalgesia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=791321&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Trouble urinating.
- Breathing problems that may get worse with [sleep apnea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=532134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [obesity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or when taking opioids with [sedatives](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450118&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Severe itching.
- Problems with [sexual](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476620&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) function.
- [Hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Hypoglycemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44114&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Opioids are more likely to cause damage to the [nervous system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446114&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in people with the following [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

- Taking morphine or codeine.
- Older age.
- Kidney problems.
- [Infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Dehydration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44659&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Talk to your doctor about side effects that bother you or become severe. Your doctor may change the opioid dose, type, and the way it is given to
help decrease the side effects. To learn more about coping with these side effects, visit:

- [Constipation and Cancer Treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation")
- [Nausea and Vomiting and Cancer Treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea-vomiting "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea-vomiting")

### Other drugs may be added to help treat your pain.

Other drugs may be given while you take opioids for pain relief. These are drugs that help the opioids work better, treat [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and
relieve certain types of pain. The following types of drugs may be used:

- [Antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Anticonvulsants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Local anesthetics.
- [Corticosteroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Bisphosphonates](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44817&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [denosumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=514443&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

People will not always respond in the same way to these drugs. Side effects are
common and should be reported to your doctor.

Bisphosphonates ([pamidronate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45175&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [zoledronic acid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=487470&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [ibandronate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=377709&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) are drugs that may be given when cancer has spread to the bones. They are given as an [intravenous infusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=520363&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and combined with other treatments to decrease pain and reduce risk of broken bones. However, bisphosphonates sometimes cause severe side effects. Talk to your doctor if you have severe muscle or bone pain. Bisphosphonate [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may need to be stopped.

Denosumab is another drug that may be used when cancer has spread to the bones. It is given as a [subcutaneous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45914&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and may help prevent and relieve pain.

## Other Treatments for Cancer Pain

### Key Points

- Nerve blocks
- Neurological treatments
- Cordotomy
- Palliative care
- Radiation therapy
- External radiation therapy
- Radiopharmaceuticals
- Physical medicine and rehabilitation
- Integrative therapies

Most [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) pain can be controlled with [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), but some people have too many [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from drugs or have pain in a certain part of the body that needs to be treated in a different way. Talk to your doctor to help decide which methods work best to relieve your pain. Other treatments include [nerve blocks](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44693&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [palliative care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269448&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Nerve blocks

A nerve block is the [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of either a [local anesthetic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44523&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other drug into or around a [nerve](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to block pain. Nerve blocks help control pain that can't be controlled in other ways. Nerve blocks may also be used to find where the pain is coming from, to predict how the pain will [respond](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to long-term
treatments, and to prevent pain after certain procedures.

### Neurological treatments

Surgery can be done to insert a [device](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=635288&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that delivers drugs or stimulates the nerves with mild electric current.

### Cordotomy

[Cordotomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=801545&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a less common surgery that is used to relieve pain by cutting certain nerves in the [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This blocks pain and hot/cold feelings. This procedure may be chosen for people who are near the end of life and have severe pain that cannot be relieved in other ways.

### Palliative care

Palliative care services can help relieve pain. Palliative care providers may also be called [supportive care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46609&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) providers. They work in teams that include doctors, [nurses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [mental health specialists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270729&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [social workers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44730&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [chaplains](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430477&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pharmacists](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=649005&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [dietitians](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44661&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some of the goals of palliative care are to:

- Improve [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for patients and their families.
- Manage pain and non-pain [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Support people who need higher [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), have a [personal history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=642021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [substance abuse](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450123&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or are [coping](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with emotional and social problems.

### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is used to relieve pain in people with skin [lesions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or cancer that has spread to the bone. This is called [palliative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45815&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) radiation therapy. It may be given as [local therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45755&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) directly to the tumor or to larger areas of the body. Radiation therapy helps drugs and other treatments work better by shrinking tumors that cause pain. Radiation therapy may help people with bone pain move more freely and with less pain.

The following types of radiation therapy may be used:

#### External radiation therapy

[External radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46686&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) uses a machine outside the body to send high-energy [x-rays](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45944&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other types of [radiation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45072&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) toward the area of the body with cancer. External radiation therapy relieves pain from cancer that has spread to the bone. Radiation therapy may be given in a single dose or divided into several smaller doses given over time. The decision to have a single or divided dose may depend on how easy it is to get the treatments and how much they cost. Some people who find little or no pain relief from first-time radiation therapy may benefit from repeated radiation therapy.

People may have a [pain flare](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=778643&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after receiving palliative radiation therapy for cancer that has spread to the bone, but this side effect is only temporary.

#### Radiopharmaceuticals

[Radiopharmaceuticals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are drugs that have a [radioactive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46550&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) substance that may be used to [diagnose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treat disease, including cancer. Radiopharmaceuticals may also be used to relieve pain from cancer that has spread to the bone. A single dose of a radioactive agent injected into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may relieve pain when cancer has spread to several areas of bone or when there are too many areas to treat with external radiation therapy.

### Physical medicine and rehabilitation

People with cancer and pain may lose their strength, freedom of movement, and ability to manage their [daily activities](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). [Physical therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [occupational therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269446&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may help.

Physical medicine uses physical methods, such as exercise and machines, to prevent and treat disease or injury. Some people may be referred to a [physiatrist](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476475&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who can develop a personal plan for them. Some physiatrists are also trained in procedures to treat and manage pain.

### Integrative therapies

[Complementary and alternative therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) combined with [standard treatment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used to treat pain. They are also called integrative therapies. [Acupuncture](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [support groups](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45917&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [hypnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44675&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are a few integrative therapies that have been used to relieve pain.

## Treating Cancer Pain in Older People

### Key Points

- Certain factors affect cancer pain treatment in older adults.
- Older people may be prescribed more than one drug.
- Doses start at lower levels.
- Side effects from drugs are more likely in older people.
- There is a risk of undertreatment (not receiving enough treatment) in older people.

### Certain factors affect cancer pain treatment in older adults.

Some problems are more likely to occur in people 65 years and older. For [caregivers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of these patients, the following should be kept in mind:

#### Older people may be prescribed more than one drug.

Older people may have more than one [chronic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease and take several drugs for different [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This can increase the risk of [drug interactions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454754&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
[Drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) taken together can change how they work in the body and can affect the person's chronic diseases.

#### Doses start at lower levels.

Pain [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is started at lower [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in older people and adjusted slowly to allow for differences in their [pain threshold](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pain expression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=800543&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and effects on physical and mental function. Lower doses given to older people may provide better pain relief that lasts longer than in younger people.

#### Side effects from drugs are more likely in older people.

Older people should be watched closely for [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from [opioids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45054&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [NSAIDs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45807&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Learn more in the [common side effects caused by opioids](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-pdq#_121) section. Other drugs may be given to avoid side effects from certain NSAIDs:

- [Acetaminophen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45165&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Proton pump inhibitors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691415&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (given with NSAIDs).
- [Topical](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45927&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) NSAIDs.
- [COX-2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=589403&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-selective NSAIDs (NSAIDs that cause fewer problems with the stomach and [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

#### There is a risk of undertreatment (not receiving enough treatment) in older people.

Undertreatment in older people may occur because:

- They do not report their pain.
- They are unable to talk about their pain.
- Doctors are concerned about the side effects or changes in behavior that may be caused by pain medicine.

Poor pain control may cause other problems in older people, including:

- Reduced physical or mental function.
- Slow [recovery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454708&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Changes in [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or sleep.
- Increased need for care and assistance with health problems.

Treating [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can also help relieve pain.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the causes and treatment of pain. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
