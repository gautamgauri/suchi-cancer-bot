## Use in Cancer

Imatinib mesylate is approved to treat:

- **[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45586&version=Patient&language=English)** in adults and children that is [Philadelphia chromosome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44179&version=Patient&language=English) [positive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44710&version=Patient&language=English). In adults, it is used for cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment. In children, it is used with chemotherapy as the first treatment after the cancer is diagnosed.
- **[Chronic eosinophilic leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=426408&version=Patient&language=English)** or **hypereosinophilic syndrome** in adults.
- **[Chronic myelogenous leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44901&version=Patient&language=English)** that is Philadelphia chromosome positive. It is used in adults and children with:
- newly-diagnosed [chronic phase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45160&version=Patient&language=English) cancer
- chronic phase, [accelerated phase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46212&version=Patient&language=English), or [blastic phase](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46113&version=Patient&language=English) cancer that got worse after [interferon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45324&version=Patient&language=English)-alpha therapy
- **[Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44276&version=Patient&language=English)** in adults whose cancer has come back, has spread to other parts of the body, and/or cannot be removed by surgery.
- **[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44998&version=Patient&language=English)** (GIST) that has the Kit protein and cannot be removed by surgery and/or has spread to other parts of the body. It is also used after surgery to completely remove the tumor in adults with *KIT*-positive cancer.
- **[Myelodysplastic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45266&version=Patient&language=English)/[myeloproliferative neoplasms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45210&version=Patient&language=English)** in adults whose cancer has an abnormal *PDGFR* gene.
- **[Systemic mastocytosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455141&version=Patient&language=English)** that is [aggressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=789073&version=Patient&language=English) and either does not have the p.D816V c-Kit gene variant or the variant status is unknown.
