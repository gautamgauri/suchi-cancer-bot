## Questions and Answers About Cartilage (Bovine and Shark)

1. **What is cartilage?**

[Cartilage](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44190&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a type of tough, flexible [connective tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44013&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that forms parts of the [skeleton](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in many animals. Cartilage contains [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [chondrocytes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44191&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are surrounded by [collagen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44196&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a [fibrous](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=344349&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) and [proteoglycans](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44218&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which are made of protein and [carbohydrate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285960&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Products containing cartilage are sold in the United States as [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Companies that make cartilage products may not have a process in place to check that all batches they make are exactly the same. This means different batches of a cartilage product may contain different amounts or strengths of ingredients. Different [binding agents](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44189&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (substances that make loose mixtures stick together) and [fillers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44205&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be used in different batches. Therefore, the results of a particular [clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may be true only for the batch that was used in the study.
2. **What is the history of the discovery and use of cartilage as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer?**

Cartilage from cows (bovine cartilage) and sharks has been studied as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and other medical [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for more than 30 years. It was once believed that sharks, whose [skeletons](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44221&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are made mostly from cartilage, do not develop cancer. This caused interest in cartilage as a possible treatment for cancer. Although [malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are rare in sharks, cancers have been found in these animals.

Early studies used [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of bovine cartilage.

- In the 1960s, it was first reported that bovine cartilage decreased [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (redness, swelling, pain, and feeling of heat).
- In the 1970s, it was first reported that bovine cartilage contains a substance that blocks [angiogenesis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46529&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (the forming of new [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). If blood vessel growth into a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) can be blocked, the tumor will stop growing or shrink.
- In the 1980s, researchers first described [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and clinical trials ([research studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651211&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in people) testing bovine cartilage
as a treatment for cancer.

Interest in using shark cartilage grew because it was believed that shark cartilage may be more active than bovine cartilage in preventing new blood vessels from being formed. Since a shark's skeleton is made mostly of cartilage, shark cartilage is more plentiful than bovine cartilage.

- In the 1980s, it was first published that shark cartilage contains a substance that blocks blood vessel growth.
- In 1998 and 2005, there were published reports of clinical trials of shark cartilage as a treatment for cancer.

(See [Question 5](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cartilage-pdq#_42) for more information about the laboratory and animal studies. See [Question 6](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cartilage-pdq#_43) for more information about the clinical trials.)
3. **What is the theory behind the claim that cartilage is useful in treating cancer?**

Three theories have been suggested to explain how cartilage acts against cancer:

- As cartilage is broken down by the body, it releases products that kill cancer cells.
- Cartilage increases the action of the body’s [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to kill cancer cells.
- Cartilage makes substances that block tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that feed a tumor and help it grow).

Based on laboratory and animal studies, the third theory may be most likely. Cartilage does not contain [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), so cancer cannot easily grow in it. It is suggested that a cancer treatment using cartilage may keep blood vessels from forming in a tumor, causing the tumor to stop growing or shrink.
4. **How is cartilage administered?**

In animal studies, cartilage products have been given by mouth; [injected](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or the [abdomen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45070&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov); applied to the skin; or placed in slow-release plastic pellets that were [surgically](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [implanted](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (put into the body).

In studies with people, cartilage products have been given by mouth; applied to the skin; injected under the skin; or given by [enema](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44204&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (injected as a liquid into the [rectum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46555&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and length of time the cartilage treatment was given was different for each study, in part because different types of products were used.
5. **Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using cartilage?**

A number of [preclinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44517&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done with cartilage. Preclinical studies in a laboratory or using animals are done to find out if a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), procedure, or treatment is likely to be safe and useful in humans. These preclinical studies are done before testing in humans is begun. Some research studies are published in [scientific](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44724&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound.

Preclinical studies of cartilage looked at whether bovine and shark cartilage products can kill cancer cells in the laboratory, make the immune system more active against cancer, and prevent blood vessels from forming.

**Powdered cartilage**

The following have been reported from preclinical studies of the effect of powdered cartilage on cancer cells [in vitro](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45733&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (outside of the body):

- In a published laboratory study, a powdered form of bovine cartilage called Catrix slowed the growth of human cancer cells by half or more. It is not clear if Catrix had this effect only on cancer cells, because its effect the growth of normal cells was not tested. It is also not known if the dose used in the laboratory study could safely be used in people.
- In a published laboratory study of powdered shark cartilage, there was no effect on the growth of human [astrocytoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45602&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells (cancer cells that begin in the brain or [spinal cord](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340937&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).

The following have been reported from preclinical studies of the effect of powdered cartilage on the immune system:

- One published study reported that Catrix injected into mice caused their immune systems to be more active. This effect did not happen when Catrix was given by mouth.
- A laboratory study on the effect of shark cartilage on a [tumor model](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44091&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported an increase in tumor-fighting immune cells in the tumor but not in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- A study on the effect of shark cartilage on immune system response in mice reported a number of different effects, both helpful and harmful. It increased [antibody](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44918&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) response but decreased the activity of [natural killer cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44062&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (tumor-fighting [white blood cells)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45993&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The study also reported a decrease in blood vessel growth.

A large number of laboratory and animal studies on the effect of powdered cartilage on angiogenesis have been published. The following have been reported from these studies:

- Powdered shark cartilage given by mouth to rats decreased the growth of [abdominal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46684&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [tissue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells.
- Powdered shark cartilage given by mouth to rats decreased the growth of [gliosarcomas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45701&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), a type of brain cancer.
- Two powdered shark cartilage products (Sharkilage and MIA Shark Powder) given by mouth to mice did not stop the growth or spread of [squamous cell skin cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46595&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Three substances that prevent blood vessel growth were found in bovine cartilage. These substances have not shown an effect on the growth of normal cells or tumor cells.
- Two substances that prevent blood vessel growth were found in shark cartilage. These substances have not shown an effect on the growth of normal cells or tumor cells.

**Liquid cartilage**

The following have been reported from preclinical studies of liquid cartilage products:

- In a laboratory study, a liquid form of shark cartilage called [AE-941](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45103&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)/Neovastat was reported to stop the growth of a number of cancer cell types. The results have not been published in a scientific journal.
- Several studies have shown that AE-941/Neovastat blocks the growth of new blood vessels.
- AE-941/Neovastat given by mouth to mice slowed the growth of [breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells and the spread of [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In the lung cancer study, AE-941/Neovastat increased the effect of the anticancer drug [cisplatin.](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45230&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)
- A substance made from human cartilage slowed the spread of [pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) cells in an animal study and prevented blood vessel growth in both animal and laboratory studies.
6. **Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using cartilage?**

Clinical trials are a type of research study that tests how well new drugs or other treatments work in people. Since the 1970s, there have been at least a dozen [clinical studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cartilage as a treatment for cancer.

There has been one [randomized clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cartilage as cancer treatment published in a [peer-reviewed scientific journal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=537399&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This trial compared treatment using a form of shark cartilage to treatment using a [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (an inactive substance that looks the same as, and is given the same way as, the substance being tested). Patients also received [standard care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In 83 patients having either [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) breast or advanced [colon cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), there was no difference in the [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [survival rate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44301&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) between the group that received the shark cartilage product and the group that received the placebo.

**Powdered cartilage**

The following have been reported from clinical trials of powdered cartilage products:

- [Case series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44006&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a collection of detailed information about individual patients) of 31 patients who were treated with Catrix by injection and/or by mouth:

The cancer went into [remission](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45867&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (signs and [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer went away) in 19 patients and then [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (came back) in about half of them. Some of these patients also received standard cancer treatment and there was no [control group](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44149&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a group of patients who do not receive the treatment being studied, to show if the treatment being studied makes a difference). For these reasons, the effectiveness of cartilage as a cancer treatment is not proven by this case series.
- A clinical trial of Cartilade by mouth in 60 patients with advanced cancer:

All but 1 patient had been treated with standard therapy before the trial. The cancer stopped growing in 10 of the patients for 12 weeks or more and then began to grow again. The cancer did not shrink or go into remission in any of the patients.

**Liquid cartilage**

The following have been reported from clinical trials of liquid cartilage products:

- A clinical trial of Catrix in 9 patients whose cancers did not [respond](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and/or [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov):

Catrix was given by injection. One patient's cancer went into remission for more than 39 weeks and the other 8 patients did not respond to treatment with Catrix.
- Clinical studies on the safety of the liquid shark cartilage product AE-941/Neovastat have reported that it has little harmful effect.
- A randomized clinical trial studied the effect of AE-941/Neovastat on blood vessel growth related to [wound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441269&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) healing after [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This study reported that one of the ingredients that prevents blood vessel growth can be absorbed and used by the body when taken by mouth.
- A clinical trial of [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) AE-941/Neovastat in 379 patients with advanced [non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported that there was no difference in how long patients lived between the group receiving the shark cartilage product and [chemoradiotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306494&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) compared to the group receiving the placebo and chemoradiotherapy. Both kinds of treatment were well tolerated.

For more detailed information about these clinical trials and others that are ongoing or have not fully reported, see the [health professional version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq#_36).
7. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from cartilage?**

The [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cartilage treatment are usually mild or moderate.

**The most common side effects of treatment with the bovine cartilage product Catrix include the following:**

- [Inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at the injection location.
- A bad taste in the mouth.
- Feeling very tired.
- [Nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- Lower than normal [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Higher than normal [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sugar.
- General weakness.
- A higher than normal level of [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the blood.

Nausea, vomiting, and upset stomach are the side effects reported most often from treatment with the shark cartilage product AE–941/Neovastat.

There has been one report of [hepatitis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) occurring in a person who used shark cartilage.
8. **Is cartilage approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The [US Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) has not approved cartilage as a treatment for cancer. A number of cartilage products are sold in the United States as dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are products meant to be added to the [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). They are not drugs and are not meant to treat, prevent, or [cure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=318813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) diseases. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that the product is safe and that the label claims are truthful and not misleading. The FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective before they are sold.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of cartilage (bovine and shark) in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

## General CAM Information

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.

Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.

Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.

## Evaluation of CAM Therapies

It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer.

Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.

[The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm "https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm") which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

## Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM

When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:

- What side effects can be expected?
- What are the risks related to this therapy?
- What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
- Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
- Will the therapy affect conventional treatment?
- Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
- If so, who is the sponsor of the trial?
- Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
