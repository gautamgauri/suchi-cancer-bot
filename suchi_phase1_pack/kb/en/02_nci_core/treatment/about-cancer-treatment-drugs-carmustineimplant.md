## Use in Cancer

Carmustine implant
is approved
to treat:

- **[Glioblastoma multiforme](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45699&version=Patient&language=English)** that has [recurred](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46556&version=Patient&language=English) (come back). It is used with [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=Patient&language=English).
- **[Malignant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45772&version=Patient&language=English) [glioma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45700&version=Patient&language=English)** that is [high grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386205&version=Patient&language=English) and has not been treated. It is used with surgery and [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=Patient&language=English).

Carmustine implant is a form of [carmustine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45976&version=Patient&language=English) contained in a wafer. The wafer has a coating that dissolves slowly and releases carmustine directly into the area where the [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=Patient&language=English) was removed. For [brain tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=387264&version=Patient&language=English), this form may work better than other forms of carmustine and have fewer [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=Patient&language=English). Carmustine is also available in a non-wafer form. For more information, see the Drug Information Summary for [Carmustine](/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/carmustine).
