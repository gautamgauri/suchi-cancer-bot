## Use in Cancer

Pegfilgrastim
is approved to reduce the chance of infection in adults and children with:

- **[Neutropenia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45361&version=Patient&language=English)** caused by [myelosuppressive](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45796&version=Patient&language=English) [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=Patient&language=English) for non-[myeloid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46279&version=Patient&language=English) [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=Patient&language=English).

Pegfilgrastim is a form of [filgrastim](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45332&version=Patient&language=English) that has [polyethylene glycol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643072&version=Patient&language=English) (PEG) attached to it. This form stays in the body longer than does filgrastim, so it doesn’t need to be given as often. For more information about filgrastim, see the Drug Information Summary for [Filgrastim](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/filgrastim).
