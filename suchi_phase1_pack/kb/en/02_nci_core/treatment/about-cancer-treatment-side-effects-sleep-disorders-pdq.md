# Sleep Disorders (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## General Information About Sleep Disorders

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sleep-disorders-hp-pdq)

### Key Points

- Getting enough sleep is needed for both physical and mental health.
- Sleep has two main phases that repeat during the sleeping period.
- Sleep disorders affect normal sleep patterns.

### Getting enough sleep is needed for both physical and mental health.

Sleep is an important part of physical and [mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). While we sleep, the brain and body do a number of important jobs that help us stay in good health and function at our best.

Getting the sleep we need:

- Improves our ability to learn, remember, and solve problems.
- Lowers [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and gives the heart and [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) the rest they need.
- Helps certain [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) control the following:

- Growth.
- The repair of [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tissues](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46683&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- The [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (to fight [infection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45364&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- [Blood sugar](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=658770&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) levels (which affect energy).
- [Appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Sleep has two main phases that repeat during the sleeping period.

There are two main phases of sleep, and both are needed in order to get "a good night's sleep." The two main phases of sleep are [rapid eye movement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454813&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM):

- REM sleep, also known as "dream sleep," is the phase of sleep in which the brain is active.
- NREM is the quiet or restful phase of sleep. It has four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep.

The phases of sleep repeat during the night in a cycle of a non-REM phase followed by a REM phase. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes and is repeated 4 to 6 times during 7 to 8 hours of sleep.

### Sleep disorders affect normal sleep patterns.

Normal sleep patterns differ from person to person. The amount of sleep you need to feel rested may be less or more than others need. If sleep is interrupted or does not last long enough, the phases of sleep are not completed and the brain cannot finish all the tasks that help restore the body and mind. There are five major types of [sleep disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454814&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that affect normal sleep.

- [Insomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Being unable to fall asleep and stay asleep.
- [Sleep apnea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=532134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A breathing [disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in which breathing stops for 10 seconds or more during sleep.
- Hypersomnia: Being unable to stay awake during the day.
- Circadian rhythm disorders: Problems with the sleep-wake cycle, making you unable to sleep and wake at the right times.
- [Parasomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454811&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): Acting in unusual ways while falling asleep, sleeping, or waking from sleep, such as walking, talking, or eating.

Sleep disorders keep you from having a good night's sleep. This may make it hard for you to stay alert and involved in activities during the day. Sleep disorders can cause problems for people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). You may not be able to remember treatment instructions and may have trouble making decisions. Being well-rested can improve energy and help you [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of cancer and treatment.

Sleep problems that go on for a long time may increase the risk of [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Sleep Disorders in People with Cancer

### Key Points

- Sleep disorders are common in people with cancer.
- Tumors may cause sleep problems.
- Certain drugs or treatments may affect sleep.
- Being in the hospital may make it harder to sleep.
- Stress caused by learning the cancer diagnosis often causes sleeping problems.
- Other health problems not related to cancer may cause a sleep disorder.

### Sleep disorders are common in people with cancer.

As many as half of people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have problems sleeping. The [sleep disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454814&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) most likely to affect people with cancer are [insomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and an [abnormal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44636&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) sleep-wake cycle.

There are many reasons you may have trouble sleeping, including:

- Physical changes caused by the cancer or [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other treatments.
- Being in the hospital.
- [Stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about having cancer.
- Health problems not related to the cancer.

### Tumors may cause sleep problems.

If you have a [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), it may cause the following problems that make it hard to sleep:

- Pressure from the tumor on nearby areas of the body.
- [Gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems ([nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [constipation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407757&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), being unable to control your [bowels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)).
- [Bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems (irritation, being unable to control [urine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46642&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) flow).
- Pain.
- [Fever](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450108&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Cough.
- Trouble breathing.
- Itching.
- Feeling very tired.

### Certain drugs or treatments may affect sleep.

Common cancer treatments and drugs can affect normal sleep patterns. How well you sleep may be affected by:

- [Hormone therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45110&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Corticosteroids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45658&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Sedatives](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450118&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [tranquilizers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=640082&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Antidepressants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44105&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Anticonvulsants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46083&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Long-term use of certain drugs may cause insomnia. Stopping or decreasing the use of certain drugs can also affect normal sleep. Other side effects of drugs and treatments that may affect the sleep-wake cycle include the following:

- Pain. For more information, see [Pain](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-pdq).
- [Anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For more information, see [Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-pdq).
- Night sweats or [hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For more information, see [Hot Flashes and Night Sweats](/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/hot-flashes-pdq).
- Gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, constipation, and diarrhea. For more information, see:

- [Nausea and Vomiting and Cancer Treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea-vomiting "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea-vomiting")
- [Constipation and Cancer Treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation")
- [Diarrhea and Cancer Treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/diarrhea "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/diarrhea")
- Bladder problems, such as irritation or being unable to control urine.
- Breathing problems.

### Being in the hospital may make it harder to sleep.

Getting a normal night’s sleep in the hospital is difficult. The following may affect your sleep in a hospital:

- Hospital environment – You may be bothered by an uncomfortable bed, pillow, or room temperature; noise; or sharing a room with a stranger.
- Hospital routine – Sleep may be interrupted when doctors and [nurses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269445&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) come in to check on you or give you drugs, other treatments, or exams.

Getting sleep during a hospital stay may also be affected by anxiety and age.

### Stress caused by learning the cancer diagnosis often causes sleeping problems.

Stress, anxiety, and [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are common
reactions to learning you have cancer, receiving treatments, and
being in the hospital. These are common causes of insomnia. For more information, see [Depression](/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-pdq).

### Other health problems not related to cancer may cause a sleep disorder.

People with cancer can have sleep disorders that are caused by other health problems. [Conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) such as snoring, headaches and daytime [seizures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) increase the chance of having a sleep disorder.

## Assessment of Sleep Disorders

### Key Points

- An assessment is done for people with sleep disorders.
- A sleep disorder assessment includes a physical exam, health history, and sleep history.
- A polysomnogram may be used to help diagnose the sleep disorder.

### An assessment is done for people with sleep disorders.

An [assessment](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430407&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is done to find problems that may be causing the [sleep disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454814&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and how it affects your life. People with mild sleep disorders may be irritable and unable to concentrate. People with moderate sleep disorders can be depressed and [anxious](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These sleep disorders may make it hard for you to stay alert and involved in activities during the day. You may not be able to remember treatment instructions and may have trouble making decisions. Being well-rested can improve energy and help you [cope](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454700&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and treatment.

People with cancer should have assessments done from time to time because sleep disorders may become more or less severe over time.

### A sleep disorder assessment includes a physical exam, health history, and sleep history.

Your doctor will do a [physical exam](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270871&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and take a [medical history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689078&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that includes:

- Side effects of your cancer and cancer treatments.
- [Medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and other [over-the-counter](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44696&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Emotional effects of the cancer and treatments.
- [Diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Exercise.
- [Caregiver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) routines.

You and your family can tell your doctor about your sleep history and patterns of sleep.

### A polysomnogram may be used to help diagnose the sleep disorder.

A [polysomnogram](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454812&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a group of recordings taken during sleep that show:

- Brain wave changes.
- Eye movements.
- Breathing rate.
- [Blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Heart rate and electrical activity of the heart and other muscles.

This information helps the doctor find the cause of your sleeping problems.

## Treatment of Sleep Disorders

### Key Points

- Treating sleep disorders may include supportive care for side effects of cancer or cancer treatment.
- Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce anxiety and help you relax.
- Learning good sleep habits is important.
- If treatment without drugs does not help,
sleep medicines may be used for a short time.

### Treating sleep disorders may include supportive care for side effects of cancer or cancer treatment.

[Sleep disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454814&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) often occur along with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-related [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and may be related. Sleep disorders that are caused by [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of the cancer or cancer treatment may be helped by relieving the [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of those side effects. It's important to talk about your sleep problems with your family and the health care team so education and support can be given. [Supportive care](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46609&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may improve your [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and ability to sleep.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce anxiety and help you relax.

[Cognitive behavioral therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CBT) helps reduce [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) about getting enough sleep. You learn to change negative thoughts and beliefs about sleep into positive thoughts and images, in order to fall asleep more easily. CBT helps replace the anxiety of “I need to sleep” with the idea of “just relax.” You learn how to change sleep habits that keep you from sleeping well. If in-person CBT sessions with a health professional are not available, video CBT sessions have been shown to be helpful. CBT may include the following:

- Stimulus control.
- Sleep restriction.
- [Relaxation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689628&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

- **Stimulus control**

When you have sleep problems for a long time, just getting ready for bed or getting into bed to sleep may cause you to start worrying that you will have another sleepless night. That worry then makes it very hard to fall asleep. Stimulus control can help you learn to connect getting ready for bed and being in bed only with being asleep. By using the bed and bedroom only when you're sleepy, the bed and sleep are linked in your mind. Stimulus control may include the following changes in your sleeping habits:

- Go to bed only when sleepy and get out of bed if you do not fall asleep after a short time. Return to bed only when you feel sleepy.
- Use the bed and bedroom only for sleeping, not for other activities.
- **Sleep restriction**

Sleep restriction decreases the time you spend in bed sleeping. This makes you more likely to feel sleepy the next night. The time you can set aside for sleeping is increased when your sleep improves.
- **Relaxation therapy**

Relaxation therapy is used to relieve muscle tension and [stress](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450122&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), lower [blood pressure](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=462668&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It is often used with [guided imagery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689577&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (focusing the mind on positive images) and [meditation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=730354&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (focusing thoughts). Self-[hypnosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44675&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) at bedtime can also help you feel relaxed and sleepy. Relaxation therapy exercises can make it easier for stimulus control and sleep restriction to work for you.

### Learning good sleep habits is important.

Good sleep habits help you fall asleep more easily and stay asleep. Habits and routines that may help improve sleep include the following:

**A comfortable bed and bedroom**

Making your bed and bedroom more comfortable may help you sleep. Some ways to increase bedroom comfort include:

- Keep the room quiet.
- Dim or turn off lights.
- Keep the room at a comfortable temperature.
- Keep skin clean and dry.
- Dress in loose, soft clothing.
- Keep bedding and pillows clean, dry, and smooth, without wrinkles.
- Use blankets to keep warm.
- Use pillows to get into a comfortable position.

**Regular bowel and bladder habits**

Regular [bowel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46500&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [bladder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46501&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) habits reduce the number of times you have to get up during the night. Waking during the night to go to the bathroom may be reduced by doing the following:

- Drink more [fluids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44669&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) during the day.
- Eat more high-[fiber](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46401&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) foods during the day.
- Avoid drinking a lot before bedtime.
- Empty your bowel and bladder before going to bed.

**Diet and exercise**

The following [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and exercise habits may improve sleep:

- Stay active during the day.
- Get regular exercise but don't exercise within 3 hours of bedtime.
- Eat a high-[protein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) snack (such as milk or turkey) 2 hours before bedtime.
- Avoid heavy, spicy, or sugary foods before bedtime.
- Avoid drinking [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or smoking before bedtime.
- Avoid foods and drinks that have [caffeine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454809&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), including [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to control [appetite](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454699&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Other habits that may improve sleep include:

- Avoid naps.
- Avoid watching TV or working in the bedroom.
- Relax before bedtime.
- Go to sleep and wake up at the same hours every day, no matter how little you slept.

**Hospital routines**

Getting a good night's sleep in a hospital or other care facility can be hard to do. The good sleep habits listed above may help you. As a hospital patient, you may also:

- Ask [caregivers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=648947&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to plan care so they wake you up the least number of times during the night.
- Ask for a back rub or massage to relieve pain or help you relax.

### If treatment without drugs does not help, sleep medicines may be used for a short time.

Treatment without [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) does not always work. Sometimes [cognitive behavioral therapies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650559&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are not available or they do not help. Also, some sleep disorders are caused by [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that need to be treated with drugs, such as [hot flashes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256567&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), pain, anxiety, [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or mood [disorders](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407758&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The drug used will depend on your type of sleep problem (such as trouble falling asleep or trouble staying asleep) and other [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) you're taking. All of your other medicines and health conditions will affect which sleeping medicines are safe and will work well for you.

Some drugs that help you sleep should not be stopped suddenly. Suddenly stopping them may cause nervousness, [seizures](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and a change in the [REM](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=512895&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) phase of sleep that increases dreaming, including nightmares. This change in REM sleep may be dangerous for people with [peptic ulcers](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=650040&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or heart conditions.

## Sleep Disorders in Special Cases

### Key Points

- People Who Have Pain
- Older Patients
- People Who Have Jaw Surgery

### People Who Have Pain

If pain disturbs your sleep, treatment to relieve the pain will be used before sleep [medicines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are used. Pain [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), other drugs being taken, and any other health [conditions](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) may affect which sleeping medicines are [prescribed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44711&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

### Older Patients

It's normal for older people to have some [insomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Changes related to age can cause lighter sleep, waking up more often during the night, and sleeping less total time. If you are an older person with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) who is having trouble sleeping, the doctor will look for the specific causes, such as:

- Physical health problems.
- [Mental health](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=441253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems, such as [anxiety](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430405&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or [depression](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=430479&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Loss of [social support](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=440116&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) use (drinking).
- [Side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of medicines.
- Conditions that commonly affect sleep, such as [restless legs syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=662021&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), cramping or jerking of the legs during sleep, and [sleep apnea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=532134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [syndrome](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45090&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Treating sleeping problems without drugs is tried first. The following may help improve sleep in older people with cancer:

- Having meals at regular times.
- Avoiding naps during the day.
- Being more active during the day.

Medicine may be used if non-drug treatments don't work. The doctor will look at all your medicines and health conditions before choosing a sleeping medicine.
For some people, doctors will suggest a [sleep disorder](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454814&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) clinic for treatment.

### People Who Have Jaw Surgery

People who have [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) on the jaw may develop sleep apnea, which is a sleep disorder that causes the person to stop breathing for 10 seconds or more during sleep. [Plastic surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=269468&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to rebuild the jaw may help prevent sleep apnea.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the causes and treatment of sleep disorders. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
