# Types of Cancer Treatment - NCI

# Types of Cancer Treatment

There are many types of cancer treatment. Some people with cancer have only one treatment. But most people have a combination of treatments, such as surgery with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The types of treatment that you receive will depend on the type of cancer you have and how advanced it is. To learn more about how specific cancers are treated, see the [cancer treatment information for adult](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/adult-treatment) and [childhood](/publications/pdq/information-summaries/pediatric-treatment) cancers. Our list of [Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Treatment](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/questions) may help you talk with your doctor and learn more about your treatment options.
