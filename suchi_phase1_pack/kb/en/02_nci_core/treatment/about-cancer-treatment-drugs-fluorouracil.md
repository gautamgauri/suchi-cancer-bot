Fluorouracil is a type of chemotherapy called an antimetabolite, which is a drug that mimics a natural chemical and prevents its use in cells. It interferes with the production of a key component of DNA, which prevents the DNA from copying itself. This causes cancer cells and other rapidly dividing cells to die. Fluorouracil also gets incorporated into RNA and DNA, disrupting critical cell functions.
