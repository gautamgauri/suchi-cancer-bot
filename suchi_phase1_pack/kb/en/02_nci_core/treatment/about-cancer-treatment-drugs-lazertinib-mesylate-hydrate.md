Lazertinib works by blocking the activity of abnormal EGFR proteins that signal cancer cells to divide. This keeps cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Lazertinib can reach cancer cells in the brain, enabling it to treat cancers that have spread there. It is a type of targeted therapy drug called an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
