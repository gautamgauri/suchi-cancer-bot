# Treatment for Cancer - NCI

# Cancer Treatment

When you need treatment for cancer, you have a lot to learn and think about, from what type of treatment is best for you, to dealing with side effects of treatment, and thinking about taking part in a clinical trial. Talking with your doctor and learning all you can about all your treatment options, including clinical trials, can help you make a decision you feel good about.
