# Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Hyaluronidase-zzxf

Placeholder slot

(per-TOO-zoo-mab tras-TOO-zoo-mab … HY-al-yoo-RAH-nih-days)

This targeted therapy combination consists of two monoclonal antibodies, pertuzumab and trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf, a recombinant form of a naturally occurring enzyme. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to different parts of the HER2 protein on the surface of some cancer cells, causing the cells to stop growing and die. Both also trigger a type of immune reaction that kills cells that have a lot of HER2. Hyaluronidase-zzxf makes it easier for the body to absorb these targeted therapies.
