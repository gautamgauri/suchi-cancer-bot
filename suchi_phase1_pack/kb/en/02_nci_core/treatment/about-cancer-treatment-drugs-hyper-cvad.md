This combination contains the chemotherapy drugs cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), methotrexate, and cytarabine and the steroid hormone dexamethasone. Combinations usually work better than single drugs because
different drugs kill
cancer
cells in different ways.
