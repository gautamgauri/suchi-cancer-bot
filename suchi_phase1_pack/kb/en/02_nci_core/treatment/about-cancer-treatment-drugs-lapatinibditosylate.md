Lapatinib ditosylate works by blocking the activity of HER2, a protein found in high levels on some cancer cells and causes them to grow. This may slow or stop the growth of cells that have a lot of HER2. Lapatinib ditosylate is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).
