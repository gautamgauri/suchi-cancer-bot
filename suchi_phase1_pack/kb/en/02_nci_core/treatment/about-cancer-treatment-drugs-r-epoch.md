This combination contains the chemotherapy drugs etoposide phosphate, vincristine sulfate (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (hydroxydaunomycin), the targeted therapy drug rituximab, and the steroid hormone prednisone. Combinations usually work better than single drugs because
different drugs kill
cancer
cells in different ways.
