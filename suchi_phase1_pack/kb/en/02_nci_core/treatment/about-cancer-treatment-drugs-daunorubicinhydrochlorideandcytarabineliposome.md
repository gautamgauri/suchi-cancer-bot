is approved to treat:

- **[Acute myeloid leukemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46347&version=Patient&language=English)** (AML) that is newly [diagnosed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46450&version=Patient&language=English). It is used in adults with therapy-related AML (tAML) or AML with [myelodysplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45953&version=Patient&language=English)-related changes (AML-MRC).

Daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine liposome is a [combination](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45650&version=Patient&language=English) form of [daunorubicin hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=583859&version=Patient&language=English) and [cytarabine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45155&version=Patient&language=English) contained inside [liposomes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=615392&version=Patient&language=English) (very tiny particles of fat). This form may work better than other forms of these drugs and have fewer [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=Patient&language=English).
