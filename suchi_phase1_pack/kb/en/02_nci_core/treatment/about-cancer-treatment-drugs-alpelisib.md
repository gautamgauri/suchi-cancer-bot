(AL-peh-LIH-sib)

Alpelisib works by blocking the activity of a protein called PI3K-alpha that signals cells to multiply. It also blocks mutant (overactive) versions of this protein found in cancer cells. This may keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Alpelisib is a type of targeted therapy drug called an enzyme inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).
