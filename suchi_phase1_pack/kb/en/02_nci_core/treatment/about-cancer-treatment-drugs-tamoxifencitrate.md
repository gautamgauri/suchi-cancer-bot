Tamoxifen citrate is a type of hormone therapy called a selective estrogen receptor modulator (or SERM). It works by binding to estrogen receptors, blocking estrogen’s effects in some tissues while mimicking its effects in others. In breast tissue, tamoxifen citrate blocks estrogen from binding to its receptors, which may prevent the growth of cancer cells. Tamoxifen citrate mimics estrogen’s effects in bone tissue, which may reduce bone resorption and turnover and increase bone mineral density.
