(LIH-fih-LOO-sel)

Lifileucel is a type of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy. TIL therapy involves removing immune cells from a patient’s tumor and testing them in the lab to find out which ones best recognize the tumor cells. The selected immune cells are then grown in large numbers in the lab and given back to the patient to help their immune system kill the tumor cells.
