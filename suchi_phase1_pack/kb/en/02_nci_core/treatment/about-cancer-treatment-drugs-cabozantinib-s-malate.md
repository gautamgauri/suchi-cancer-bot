Cabozantinib-s-malate works by blocking proteins that signal cancer cells to divide. It also blocks proteins that signal the growth of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients needed for tumor growth. Blocking these signals keeps cancer cells from growing and spreading to other parts of the body. Cabozantinib-s-malate is a type of targeted therapy drug called a kinase inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).
