(EP-koh-RIH-tah-mab)

Epcoritamab-bysp works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and lymphoma cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the lymphoma cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called CD20 on B cells (the immune cells that are cancerous in B-cell lymphomas). Epcoritamab-bysp is a type of targeted therapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE).

## Use in Cancer

Epcoritamab-bysp
is approved to treat adults with:

- **[Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428286&version=Patient&language=English)** (DLBCL) or **[high-grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45710&version=Patient&language=English) [B-cell lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444967&version=Patient&language=English).**
- **[Follicular lymphoma](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=428287&version=Patient&language=English).**

Epcoritamab-bysp is used in patients with cancer that has come back or did not get better after at least two lines of systemic therapy.

These uses are approved under FDA’s [Accelerated Approval Program](https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Fast/ucm405447.htm). As a condition of approval, [confirmatory trial(s)](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=799146&version=Patient&language=English) must show that epcoritamab-bysp provides a clinical benefit in these patients.

Epcoritamab-bysp
is also being studied in the treatment of other types of
cancer.
