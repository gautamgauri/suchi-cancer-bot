Fulvestrant is a type of hormone therapy called a selective estrogen receptor degrader (or SERD). It binds to the estrogen receptor, blocking estrogen binding and its action on cancer cells. It also targets the estrogen receptor for destruction. This slows or stops the growth of cancer cells that need estrogen to grow.
