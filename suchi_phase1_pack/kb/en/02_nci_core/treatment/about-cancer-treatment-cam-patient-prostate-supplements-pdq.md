# Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements (PDQ®)–Patient Version

## Introduction

[Go to Health Professional Version](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq)

[Complementary and alternative medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44964&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (CAM) is a form of treatment used in addition to (complementary) or instead of (alternative) [standard treatments](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In the United States, about 1 out of every 8 men will be diagnosed with [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). It is the second most common [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in men in the United States. CAM use among men with prostate cancer is common. Studies of why men with prostate cancer decide to use CAM show that their choice is based on [medical history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=689078&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), beliefs about the safety and [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of CAM compared to standard treatments, and a need to feel in control of their treatment.

CAM treatments used by men with prostate cancer include certain foods, [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [herbs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Different types of studies have been done to study the use of CAM in prostate cancer. These study types include:

- Combined study: A combined study analyzes data from more than one study done on the same topic, such as the [response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to a dietary supplement, risk of getting cancer, or treatment of cancer. The results of a combined study are usually stronger than the results of any study by itself. A combined study is also called a [meta-analysis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691484&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Population study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A population study looks at a group of people who are part of the general population and share a common characteristic, such as age, sex, or health [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). This group of people may be studied for different reasons, such as their response to a dietary supplement or risk of getting cancer. A population study is also called an epidemiologic study.
- [Clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): A clinical trial looks at how well new medical approaches work in people. These studies may test new methods of [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), diagnosis, or treatment of cancer. Clinical trials with a small number of people or when the treatment is not [randomly](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322881&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) assigned are not included in this summary. See the clinical trial sections of the health professional version of [Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq) for information on clinical trials done using [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or supplements.
- [Laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov): In laboratory studies, a substance is tested in [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to find out if it has any anticancer effects. In animal studies, a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), procedure, or treatment is tested in mice or other animals to see if it is safe and effective. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people.

CAM treatments have been studied to see if their use lowers the risk of prostate cancer, kills prostate cancer cells, or lowers the risk that cancer will come back after treatment. Most of these studies used [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PSA) levels to find out whether the treatment worked. This is a weaker measure of how well the treatment works than direct measures, such as fewer new cases of prostate cancer, or smaller tumor size or lower rate of [recurrence](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45861&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) after treatment for prostate cancer.

This [PDQ](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) summary has sections about the use of specific foods and dietary supplements to prevent or treat prostate cancer:

- [Calcium](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_446)
- [Green Tea](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_175)
- [Lycopene](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_3)
- [Modified Citrus Pectin](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_61)
- [Pomegranate](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_79)
- [Selenium](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_250)
- [Soy](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_95)
- [Vitamin D](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_295)
- [Vitamin E](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_269)
- [Combination Therapies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_447)
- [Other Prostate Health Supplements](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_347)

Each section includes the following information for each food or dietary supplement:

- How it is given or taken.
- Results of studies done in people.
- Side effects or risks.
- [Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (FDA) information.

## Overview of CAM Use in Prostate Cancer

Studies of [CAM](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44384&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) use to treat [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have shown the following:

- Men who have prostate cancer are more likely to take [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and eat certain foods than men who do not have prostate cancer.
- Men who have prostate cancer and who have healthy eating habits (for example, eating lots of fish rich in [omega-3 fatty acids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45809&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and vegetables) are more likely to take dietary supplements.
- Men who have prostate cancer use CAM treatments to help boost the [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), improve [quality of life](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45417&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and lower the risk of the [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) coming back, but only half of them tell their doctors about their use of CAM.

Studies of CAM use to lower prostate cancer risk or to [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) it from coming back have shown the following:

- A study of men with a [family history](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=302456&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of prostate cancer found that over half used [vitamins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or other dietary supplements for [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) health or to prevent cancer.
- A study of men at a prostate cancer [screening](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) clinic found that over half took multivitamins and some took [herbal supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=560646&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- A study of prostate cancer [survivors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450125&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found that up to one-third took vitamins or [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Calcium: Questions and Answers

1. **What is calcium?**

[Calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a common [mineral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the body that helps [blood vessels](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), muscles, and [nerves](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373935&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) send signals from [cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) to cell and release [hormones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45713&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The body stores most calcium in bones and teeth.
2. **How is calcium given or taken?**

The main sources of calcium are in foods and [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). About one-third of dietary calcium comes from milk and milk products like cheese and yogurt. Vegetable sources include bok choy, kale, and broccoli. Calcium is sometimes added to foods and drinks, such as fruit juices, tofu, and cereals.

Most research about calcium and [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) risk has studied calcium in the [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), not calcium in supplements.
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using calcium?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using calcium, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_513) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies of calcium been done in people?**

Studies of people in many parts of the world have been done to find out if there is a link between dairy products, calcium supplements, and prostate cancer risk. The results of these studies have been mixed. Some studies have shown that calcium has an effect on the overall risk of developing prostate cancer or on stopping [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from coming back after treatment, and others have not.

For information on studies in people taking calcium supplements, dairy products, or non-dairy calcium products, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_436) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
5. **Is calcium approved by the FDA
for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of calcium as a treatment for cancer.

The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of calcium supplements may not be the same.

## Green Tea: Questions and Answers

1. **What is green tea?**

Tea comes from the *Camellia sinensis* plant. The way tea leaves are processed determines whether green tea, black tea, or oolong tea is made. Green tea is made by steaming and drying the leaves.

The health benefits studied in green tea are thought to be from [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) called [polyphenols](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Polyphenols are a group of plant [chemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=643008&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that include [catechins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([antioxidants](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that help protect [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from damage). Catechins make up most of the polyphenols in green tea and vary based on the source of the tea leaves and how they are processed. This makes it hard to identify most of the chemical factors linked to the health benefits of green tea.

Some studies suggest that green tea may protect against [heart](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748138&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease.
2. **How is green tea given or taken?**

People usually drink green tea or take it as a [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using green tea?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using green tea, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_185) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies of green tea been done in people?**

[Population studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to find out if green tea can [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treat [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Results have been mixed. Some studies have shown a short-term decrease in [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PSA) level or a lower risk of having prostate cancer, and others have not. There is not enough evidence to know whether green tea can prevent or treat prostate cancer.

Overall, population studies suggest that green tea may help protect against prostate cancer in Asian populations. Prostate cancer deaths in Asia are among the lowest in the world. Other populations have not been studied.

For information on studies in people drinking green tea or taking green tea supplements, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_199) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from green tea?**

A trial of [oral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [green tea extract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=389271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in patients with [solid tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45301&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) reported that drinking 7 to 8 Japanese-style cups (equal to 3 ½ to 4 US cups) of tea 3 times a day for 6 months was a safe [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Clinical trials have reported on the safety of long-term use of green tea to prevent prostate cancer. In a United States trial, men at risk of prostate cancer were given green tea extract or a placebo for 1 year. There were more [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the group who received the green tea extract than in the group who received the placebo.

In safety studies of green tea for men with prostate cancer, short-term green tea use for up to 90 days was well tolerated. One study found that the most reported side effects of green tea were headache, chest pain, or [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). These were mild except for two reports of trouble breathing and severe [anorexia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44103&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In men with [advanced](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer, side effects of green tea included [insomnia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [confusion](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=450096&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [fatigue](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321374&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In rare cases, [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) problems have occurred.
6. **Is green tea approved by the FDA
for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of green tea as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The FDA Division of Drug Oncology Products recommends that green tea extract be taken with food by participants in clinical trials and that frequent [liver function tests](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390293&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) be considered during treatment, especially in the first few months of starting a clinical trial.

Green tea is available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of green tea supplements may not be the same.

## Lycopene: Questions and Answers

1. **What is lycopene?**

[Lycopene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44909&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [carotenoid](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46132&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (a natural red color made by plants). It mixes with or dissolves in fats. Lycopene protects plants from light-related stress and helps them use the energy of the sun to make [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Lycopene is found in fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, apricots, guavas, and watermelons.

The main source of lycopene in the United States is tomato-based products. Lycopene is easier for the body to use when it is eaten in processed tomato products like tomato paste and tomato puree than in raw tomatoes.

Lycopene has been studied for its role in the [prevention](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of [heart](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748138&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease.
2. **How is lycopene given or taken?**

Lycopene may be eaten in food or taken in [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using lycopene?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using lycopene, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_9) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies of lycopene been done in people?**

[Population studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to find out if lycopene can prevent or treat [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Some studies have shown a lower risk of prostate cancer or a decrease in [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PSA) level, and others have not. These mixed results may be explained by differences within the studies, such as the sources and types of lycopene studied, the diets of the participants, and differences in participants' prostate cancer [risk factors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45873&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (e.g., [genetics](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444994&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [obesity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=527371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [tobacco](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439432&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [alcohol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463134&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) use). Also, most research has studied the effects of lycopene on the risk of all prostate cancers, and has not studied effects of lycopene on [low-grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386213&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer compared with [high-grade](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386205&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer. There is not enough evidence to know whether lycopene can prevent or treat prostate cancer.

For information on studies in people taking lycopene supplements or foods containing lycopene, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_12) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.

For information on trials of combination therapies that include lycopene, see the [Combination Therapies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/prostate-supplements-pdq#_447) section of this summary.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from lycopene?**

Lycopene has been given in many clinical trials with very few [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Side effects, such as [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [nausea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390302&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [vomiting](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=390324&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [bloating](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476585&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), increased gas, and [stomach](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46604&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) irritation have been reported. In one study, [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) went away when lycopene was taken with meals.
6. **Is lycopene approved by the FDA
for use to prevent or treat cancer in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of lycopene as a treatment for cancer or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Lycopene is available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of lycopene supplements may not be the same.

## Modified Citrus Pectin: Questions and Answers

1. **What is modified citrus pectin?**

Pectin is a substance made of small sugar [molecules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45065&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that are linked together. Pectin is found in the [cell](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) wall of most plants and has gel-like qualities that are useful in making many types of food and [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Citrus pectin is found in the peel and pulp of citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes. Citrus pectin can be modified (changed) during manufacturing so that it can be dissolved in water and absorbed by the body. This changed citrus pectin is called modified citrus pectin (MCP).
2. **How is MCP given or taken?**

MCP may be taken by mouth in powder or [capsule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) form.
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using MCP?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using MCP, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_65) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.

## Pomegranate: Questions and Answers

1. **What is pomegranate?**

The [pomegranate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a fruit grown in Asia and in the Mediterranean, East Indies, Africa, and the United States. Pomegranate has been used as [medicine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=482419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for hundreds of years.

The pomegranate is made up of the following:

- The peel, which makes up half the fruit and contains [polyphenols](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [minerals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- The seeds.
- The aril (the layer between the peel and the seeds), which contains phenolics and [flavonoids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330168&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) including anthocyanins, which give the pomegranate fruit and juice a red color.
2. **How is pomegranate given or taken?**

Pomegranate fruit and juice may be taken as food, drink, or a [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies

## Selenium: Questions and Answers

1. **What is selenium?**

[Selenium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45113&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [mineral](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45787&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is essential to people in tiny amounts. Selenium is needed for many body functions, including reproduction and [immunity](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=468803&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Food sources of selenium include meat, vegetables, and nuts. The amount of selenium found in the food depends on the amount of selenium in the soil where the food grows. Selenium is stored in the [thyroid gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44751&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [liver](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46312&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pancreas](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46254&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [pituitary gland](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46229&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and [kidneys](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46325&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Selenium may play a role in many diseases, including [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Results of the large [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-sponsored Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) suggest that men with [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) should not take selenium supplements.
2. **How is selenium given or taken?**

Selenium may be eaten in food or taken in [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using selenium?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using selenium, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_294) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies of selenium been done in people?**

[Population studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to find out if selenium can [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treat prostate cancer. The results of these studies have been mixed, but the results of a large, [randomized clinical trial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) showed selenium had no effect on preventing prostate cancer.

For information on studies in people taking selenium, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_307) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
5. **Have any side effects or risks of selenium supplements been reported?**

Selenium supplements have been well tolerated in many clinical trials. But, in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, the use of selenium supplements was linked with a slight increase in the rate of diabetes mellitus.

In several large studies, men with high selenium levels were at greater risk of being diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer or dying from prostate cancer.
6. **Is selenium approved by the FDA
for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of selenium supplements for the treatment or prevention of cancer.

Selenium is available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer.

## Soy: Questions and Answers

1. **What is soy?**

The [soybean](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=415913&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) plant has been grown in Asia for food for hundreds of years. Soybeans are used to make soy milk, miso, tofu, soy flour, oil, and other food products.

Soy foods contain [phytochemicals](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44709&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that may have health benefits. [Isoflavones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are the most widely studied [compounds](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in soy. Major isoflavones in the soybean include [genistein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46107&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [daidzein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=285740&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and glycitein.

Isoflavones are [phytoestrogens](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=330175&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([estrogen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46076&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)-like substances found in plants) that attach to [estrogen receptors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46409&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found in [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Genistein may affect some processes inside prostate cancer cells that are involved in the growth and spread of [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
2. **How is soy given or taken?**

Soy may be eaten in food or taken in [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using soy?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using soy, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_110) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies of soy been done in people?**

[Population studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to find out if soy can [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treat prostate cancer. The results of these studies have been mixed. Some studies have shown a lower risk of prostate cancer or a change in [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PSA) level, and others have not. The results may be mixed because of the small number of men who participated in the studies and the different types and [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of soy products given.

Small [randomized clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to study the effects of isoflavones or soy on prostate cancer. The results of these studies have been mixed. See [Table 3](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_704), [Table 4](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_705), and [Table 5](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_706) of the health professional version of [Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq) for information on randomized, [placebo-controlled](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44840&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) clinical trials of isoflavones and soy.

For more information on studies in people taking soy supplements, soy products, or soy found in foods, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_120) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from soy?**

Soy products and isoflavones have caused very few [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in people with prostate cancer who participated in clinical trials. The most commonly reported side effects were [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [diarrhea](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=306496&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
6. **Is soy approved by the FDA
for use to prevent or treat cancer in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of soy as a treatment for cancer or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

## Vitamin D: Questions and Answers

1. **What is vitamin D?**

[Vitamin D](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=427253&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is a [fat-soluble vitamin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=560348&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) found in fatty fish, fish liver oil, and eggs. Vitamin D may also be added to dairy products. Vitamin D:

- Helps absorb [calcium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45632&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from food in the [small intestine](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46582&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Improves muscle strength and [immune system](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46356&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) function.
- Lowers [inflammation](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44042&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Maintains levels of calcium and [phosphate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476349&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in the [blood](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=270735&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Helps with bone growth and protects against [osteoporosis](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45371&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in adults.

A person's vitamin D level is checked by measuring the amount of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the blood.
2. **How is vitamin D given or taken?**

Vitamin D is made by the body when exposed to sunlight.
Vitamin D may also be eaten in food or taken in [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
3. **Have any laboratory or animal studies
been done using vitamin D?**

For information on [laboratory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) done using vitamin D, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_363) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any studies of vitamin D been done in people?**

[Population studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to study the effects of vitamin D on [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The results of these studies have been mixed. Some studies have shown a link between Vitamin D levels and prostate cancer, and others have not. There is not enough evidence to know whether vitamin D can [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) prostate cancer.

Studies often look at specific factors that affect a person's vitamin D levels to see how those factors influence prostate cancer risk. Factors that have been studied include:

- Low sun exposure.
- Levels of vitamin D in the diet and blood.
- Genetic changes.

Some genetic changes in tumor features that interact with vitamin D might affect the growth and spread of prostate cancer. One of those features is a molecule called a vitamin D receptor. Studies suggest that changes in this receptor could influence a person's risk of prostate cancer or increase the chance that the cancer will spread. More research is needed to confirm that vitamin D receptors play a role in prostate cancer.

For information on studies in people taking vitamin D supplements, vitamin D products, or vitamin D in food, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_864) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
5. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from vitamin D?**

Vitamin D can cause serious health problems when taken at high [doses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) over many years. Taking high levels of Vitamin D can cause too much calcium to be absorbed in the [intestines](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46335&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), leading to rapid increases in blood calcium levels. This [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is called [hypercalcemia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45363&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

In a group of 26 studies, Vitamin D was reviewed for safety, how well it works, and whether it [interacts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454754&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) with [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) used to treat prostate cancer and other [tumors](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The reviewers found the risk of [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and interactions with other drugs to be low.

Several studies looked at the safety of high-dose vitamin D and how well it works with [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) ([docetaxel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45382&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) to treat men with prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy. The side effects that occurred after treatment with high-dose vitamin D and docetaxel were the same as the side effects noted after treatment with docetaxel alone.
6. **Is vitamin D approved by the FDA
for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of vitamin D as a treatment for [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

Vitamin D is available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of vitamin D supplements may not be the same.

## Vitamin E: Questions and Answers

1. **What is vitamin E?**

[Vitamin E](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45023&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) is an [antioxidant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that may help protect [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from damage. Vitamin E also affects how signals are sent within cells and how the cell makes [RNA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46568&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [proteins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46092&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

There are eight forms of vitamin E: four tocopherols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and sigma-) and four tocotrienols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and sigma-). [Alpha-tocopherol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=691423&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the form of vitamin E used in [dietary supplements](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), is found in greater amounts in the body and is the most active form of vitamin E. Most vitamin E in the [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) comes from gamma-tocopherol. Food sources of vitamin E include vegetable oils, nuts, and egg yolks.

Vitamin E may protect against [chronic diseases](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45641&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as [heart](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=748138&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [blood vessel](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45020&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) disease.
2. **How is vitamin E given or taken?**

Vitamin E may be eaten in food or taken in dietary supplements.
3. **Have any studies of vitamin E been done in people?**

[Population studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=561718&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) and [clinical trials](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45961&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been done to find out if vitamin E may [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The results of these studies have been mixed. Some studies have shown no change in the overall risk of prostate cancer, and others have shown an increased risk of prostate cancer. There is not enough evidence to know whether vitamin E affects the risk of prostate cancer.

For information on studies in people taking vitamin E supplements, vitamin E products, or vitamin E in food, see the [Human Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_336) section of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.
4. **Have any side effects or risks been reported from vitamin E?**

In the Physicians' Health Study II and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group, there was a higher number of [strokes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439425&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) caused by a broken blood vessel in the brain in men who took vitamin E than in men who took a placebo.
5. **Is vitamin E approved by the FDA
for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?**

The FDA has not approved the use of vitamin E as a treatment for cancer.

Vitamin E is available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of vitamin E supplements may not be the same.

## Combination Therapies

### Pomi-T (Pomegranate, Green Tea, Broccoli, and Turmeric)

[Polyphenols](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=256573&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are found in many plants and give some flowers, fruits, and vegetables their color. Polyphenols have [antioxidant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=43997&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity that may help protect [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) from damage.

A food [supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45916&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that is high in polyphenols was studied in a group of men who had [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) that had not spread. This supplement contained the following:

- [Pomegranate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) whole fruit powder.
- [Green tea extract](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=389271&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Broccoli powder.
- [Turmeric](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463050&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) powder.

One hundred and ninety-nine men were randomly assigned to receive either the food supplement or a [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) for 6 months. The food supplement was well tolerated. However, men in the supplement group were more likely to have [gastrointestinal](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45692&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as increased gas and loose bowels.

### Lycopene, Selenium, and Green Tea

A [dietary supplement](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=373932&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) was studied in 60 men at high risk of prostate cancer (high-grade [prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44345&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). The supplement contained the following:

- [Lycopene](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44909&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- [Selenium](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45113&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Green tea [catechins](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686469&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The men were [randomly](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=322881&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) assigned to receive the supplement or a [placebo](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46688&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Men who took the supplement for 6 months had higher rates of prostate cancer when they had a repeat [biopsy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45164&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) than men who did not take the supplement. This result may be due to cancers missed at the start of the study.

### Lycopene and Other Therapies

A study enrolled 79 men who were scheduled to have a [prostatectomy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45851&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For 3 weeks before [surgery](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45570&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), the men were assigned to eat or drink either:

- Tomato products containing lycopene.
- Tomato products plus selenium, [omega 3-fatty acids](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45809&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [soy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407766&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [isoflavones](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), grape/[pomegranate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=321386&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) juice, and green/black tea.
- A [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) without added [nutrients](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44697&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).

The [prostate-specific antigen](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46540&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (PSA) levels were the same for men who received added nutrients and those who did not. However, among men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer, lower PSA levels were found in those who ate the tomato products or had the highest increases in lycopene levels.

### Zyflamend

Zyflamend is a dietary supplement that contains [extracts](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=407760&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) of 10 different [herbs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=463714&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) in olive oil:

- Rosemary.
- Turmeric.
- [Ginger](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=340930&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov).
- Holy basil.
- Green tea.
- Hu zhang (*Polygonum cuspidatum*).
- Chinese goldthread.
- Barberry.
- Oregano.
- Baikal skullcap.

The herb extracts used in Zyflamend may have [anti-inflammatory](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44187&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) activity. There is not enough evidence to know whether Zyflamend can [prevent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439419&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) or treat prostate cancer.

Zyflamend is taken as a dietary supplement in [capsule](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=455334&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) form.

No serious [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) have been reported for Zyflamend. In one study, some men had mild heartburn that went away when Zyflamend was taken with food.

## Other Prostate Health Supplements

### Overview

African cherry (*pygeum africanum*) and [beta-sitosterol](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=773858&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) are two supplements that have been studied for general [prostate](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46539&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) health and the treatment of [benign prostatic hyperplasia](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46509&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) (BPH) and [prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). For more information, see the [African cherry](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_390) (*pygeum africanum*) and [beta-sitosterol](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#_394) sections of the health professional version of Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements.

## About This PDQ Summary

### About PDQ

Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq "https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq").

PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

### Purpose of This Summary

This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of nutrition and dietary supplements for reducing the risk of developing prostate cancer or for treating prostate cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.

### Reviewers and Updates

Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.

The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam").

### Clinical Trial Information

A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials "https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials"). For more information, call the [Cancer Information Service](https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center "https://www.cancer.gov/contact/contact-center") (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

## General CAM Information

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease.

Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies.

Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment.

## Evaluation of CAM Therapies

It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer.

Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm.

[The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm "https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm") which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research.

## Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM

When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions:

- What side effects can be expected?
- What are the risks related to this therapy?
- What benefits can be expected from this therapy?
- Do the known benefits outweigh the risks?
- Will the therapy affect conventional treatment?
- Is this therapy part of a clinical trial?
- If so, who is the sponsor of the trial?
- Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
