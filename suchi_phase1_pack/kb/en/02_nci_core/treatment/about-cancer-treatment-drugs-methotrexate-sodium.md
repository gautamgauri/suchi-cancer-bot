Methotrexate sodium is a type of chemotherapy called an antimetabolite, which is a drug that mimics a natural chemical and prevents its use in cells. It interferes with the way cells divide and function. More specifically, it is an antifolate, a type of drug that stops cells from using folic acid to make and repair DNA. This helps kill cancer cells and other dividing cells.
