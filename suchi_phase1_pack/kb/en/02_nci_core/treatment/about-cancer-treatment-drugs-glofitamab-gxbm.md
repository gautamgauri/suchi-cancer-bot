Placeholder slot

(gloh-FIH-tah-mab)

Glofitamab-gxbm works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and lymphoma cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the lymphoma cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and a protein called CD20 on B cells (the immune cells that are cancerous in B-cell lymphomas). Glofitamab-gxbm is a type of immunotherapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE).
