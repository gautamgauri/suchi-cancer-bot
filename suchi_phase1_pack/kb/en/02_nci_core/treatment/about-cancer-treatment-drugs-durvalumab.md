It is used with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin.
- **[endometrial cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444987&version=Patient&language=English)** that is [mismatch repair deficient](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=789741&version=Patient&language=English) (dMMR).

- with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and does not have an abnormal *EGFR* gene or *ALK* gene
- **[small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45327&version=Patient&language=English).** It is used:
- alone in patients with [limited-stage cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45910&version=Patient&language=English) that did not get worse after
