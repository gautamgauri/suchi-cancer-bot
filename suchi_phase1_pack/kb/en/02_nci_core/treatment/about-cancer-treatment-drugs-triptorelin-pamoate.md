(TRIP-toh-REH-lin PAM-oh-ayt)

Triptorelin works by first signaling the pituitary gland to release more luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which briefly raises testosterone levels. With continued use, the pituitary gland stops making as much LH and FSH, leading to lower testosterone levels over time. This helps slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that need testosterone to grow.
It is a type of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.
