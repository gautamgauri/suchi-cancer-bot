Placeholder slot

(I-voh-SIH-deh-nib )

Ivosidenib works by blocking an abnormal enzyme that some cancer cells with specific changes in the IDH-1 gene make. Blocking the abnormal enzyme may make cancer cells differentiate to become more like normal cells and grow more slowly. Ivosidenib is a type of targeted therapy drug called an enzyme inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).
