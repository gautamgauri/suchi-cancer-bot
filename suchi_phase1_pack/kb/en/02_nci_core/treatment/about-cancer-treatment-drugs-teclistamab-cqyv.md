Teclistamab-cqyv works by bringing healthy T cells (immune cells that help kill cancer cells) and myeloma cells close together so the T cells can more effectively kill the myeloma cells. It does this by binding to a protein called CD3 on healthy T cells and to a protein called BCMA on myeloma cells. Teclistamab-cqyv is a type of targeted therapy drug called a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE).
