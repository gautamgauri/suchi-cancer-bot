Afamitresgene autoleucel uses a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell). In the lab, a special receptor is added to the T cells, allowing them to recognize an antigen (protein) called MAGE-A4, found on some cancer cells. These modified T cells are then grown in large numbers in the lab and infused back into the patient. Once inside the body, afamitresgene autoleucel binds to the MAGE-A4 antigen on cancer cells, helping the immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells. This treatment is a type of cellular immunotherapy called T-cell receptor therapy.
