Olaparib works by blocking the activity of PARP enzymes, which help repair damaged DNA in cells. Cancer cells with BRCA mutations or certain other gene mutations cannot use a key DNA repair process called homologous recombination (HR) and need PARP enzymes to survive. Blocking the activity of PARP enzymes causes these cancer cells to die. Olaparib is a type of targeted therapy drug called a PARP inhibitor. It is a small-molecule drug (a drug that can enter cells easily).

## Use in Cancer

Olaparib
is approved
to treat:

- **[Breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=Patient&language=English)** that is [HER2 negative](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=774531&version=Patient&language=English) and has certain [germline mutations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46384&version=Patient&language=English) in the *[BRCA1](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46047&version=Patient&language=English)* or *[BRCA2](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46742&version=Patient&language=English)* gene. Olaparib is used after surgery in adults with:
- high-risk [early-stage breast cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=446564&version=Patient&language=English) that has been treated with chemotherapy before or after surgery
- [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=Patient&language=English) cancer that has been treated with chemotherapy before or after the cancer spread
- **[Ovarian epithelial](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46768&version=Patient&language=English),** **[fallopian tube](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=755773&version=Patient&language=English),** or **[primary peritoneal cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=386215&version=Patient&language=English).** Olaparib is used as [maintenance therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45768&version=Patient&language=English) in adults who are having a [complete](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=Patient&language=English) or [partial response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45819&version=Patient&language=English) to [platinum](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45841&version=Patient&language=English) chemotherapy. It is used:
- as the first maintenance therapy in patients with advanced cancer that has certain germline or [somatic mutations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46586&version=Patient&language=English) in the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* gene
- with [bevacizumab](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46115&version=Patient&language=English) as the first maintenance therapy in patients with advanced cancer that has [genomic instability](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=800171&version=Patient&language=English) and/or certain germline or somatic mutations in the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* gene
- in patients with [recurrent](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45862&version=Patient&language=English) cancer
- **[Pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=Patient&language=English).** Olaparib is used as maintenance therapy in adults with metastatic cancer that has not [progressed](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44078&version=Patient&language=English) after first-line therapy with platinum chemotherapy and has certain germline mutations in the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* gene.
- **[Prostate cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445079&version=Patient&language=English)** that has spread to other parts of the body and is [castrate resistant](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=753525&version=Patient&language=English) (has not responded to treatments that lower [testosterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45581&version=Patient&language=English) levels). Olaparib is used:
- alone in adults with germline or somatic mutations in certain genes involved in the [homologous
recombination repair pathway](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=801714&version=Patient&language=English) whose cancer has gotten worse after treatment with [enzalutamide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=740024&version=Patient&language=English) or [abiraterone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=641969&version=Patient&language=English)
- with abiraterone and [prednisone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45492&version=Patient&language=English) or [prednisolone](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46155&version=Patient&language=English) in adults with certain mutations in the *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* gene

Olaparib
is also being studied in the treatment of other types of
cancer.
