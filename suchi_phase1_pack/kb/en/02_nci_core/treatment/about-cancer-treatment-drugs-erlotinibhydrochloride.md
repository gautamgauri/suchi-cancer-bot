## Use in Cancer

Erlotinib hydrochloride is approved to be used alone or with other [drugs](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=Patient&language=English) to treat:

- **[Non-small cell lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45323&version=Patient&language=English)** (NSCLC) that is [metastatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44058&version=Patient&language=English) and has certain *[EGFR](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=796876&version=Patient&language=English)* gene [mutations](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46063&version=Patient&language=English). It may be used:
- As the first therapy.
- In patients on [maintenance therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45768&version=Patient&language=English) or whose disease has gotten worse after treatment with chemotherapy.

The use of erlotinib hydrochloride to treat NSCLC that does not have the *EGFR* gene mutations is no longer [FDA](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=Patient&language=English)-approved.
- **[Pancreatic cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44521&version=Patient&language=English).** It is used with [gemcitabine hydrochloride](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=508951&version=Patient&language=English) in patients whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery or has spread.

Erlotinib hydrochloride is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.
