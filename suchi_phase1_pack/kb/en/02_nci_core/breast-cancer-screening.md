## What is breast cancer screening?

Breast cancer screening involves checking for breast cancer before symptoms appear. The main screening method is mammography, which uses X-rays to detect abnormalities.

## Screening guidelines overview

- **Age 40-49:** Women may choose to begin annual or biennial mammography
- **Age 50-74:** Regular mammography screening (every 1-2 years) is generally recommended
- **High risk individuals:** May need to start earlier or have more frequent screening

## Important notes

- Screening recommendations may vary based on individual risk factors
- Family history, genetic factors, and personal medical history influence screening decisions
- Screening does not prevent cancer but can help find it early
- Early detection often leads to more treatment options and better outcomes

## Risk factors

Factors that may increase breast cancer risk include:
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Family history of breast or ovarian cancer
- Genetic mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2)
- Previous breast cancer diagnosis
- Dense breast tissue
- Previous radiation therapy to the chest

## Next steps

- Discuss your personal screening plan with a healthcare provider
- Understand your individual risk factors
- Know the benefits and limitations of screening
- Report any breast changes to your doctor immediately, regardless of when you last had screening

## Questions to ask your doctor

- What is my personal risk for breast cancer?
- When should I start screening?
