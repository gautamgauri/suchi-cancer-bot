## What cancer is

Cancer is uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Sometimes it forms a lump (tumour) and in some cases can spread to other parts of the body (metastasis).

## Key points

- Cancer is a disease where cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled way
- Not all tumours are cancerous - some are benign (non-cancerous)
- Early detection and treatment improve outcomes
- Many types of cancer are treatable, especially when caught early

## Next steps

- Persistent symptoms (2–3+ weeks) merit an in-person evaluation with a healthcare provider
- Severe symptoms (breathing difficulty, heavy bleeding, fainting) require urgent care
- Regular check-ups and screenings are important for early detection

## Questions to ask a doctor

- What are the likely causes of my symptoms?
- What tests are recommended next, and why?
- When should I be concerned and seek urgent care?
