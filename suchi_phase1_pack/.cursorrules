# Default Orchestrator Behavior

We are making a single PR-sized change. No refactors. Follow file boundaries. Use the handoff format. Treat safety behavior as invariant. DoD commands must be runnable as written. When problems are found, route directly to specialized developers (see .cursor/agents/ROUTING_GUIDE.md).

## Sub-Agent Routing

When tasks are identified, automatically route to appropriate sub-agents:
- Retrieval/RAG issues → @retrieval-engineer
- Safety/Evidence issues → @safety-gatekeeper
- Infrastructure/Deployment issues → @devops-gcp-deployer
- Test/Evaluation issues → @tests-eval-author

## Handoff Format

Always create handoff documents in `docs/ops/handoffs/` before routing to sub-agents.
